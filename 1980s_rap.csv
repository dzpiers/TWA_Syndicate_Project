[Intro: Eric B. and Rakim]
Yo, Rakim, what's up?
Yo, I'm doing the knowledge, E, man, I'm trying to get paid in full
Well, check this out; since Norby Walters is our agency, right?
True
Cara Lewis is our agent
Word up
Zakia and 4th and Broadway is our record company
Indeed
Okay, so, who we rollin' with, then?
We rollin' with Rush—of Rushtown Management
Check this out; since we talkin' over this def' beat right here that I put together
I wanna hear some of them def' rhymes, you know what I'm sayin'?
And, together, we can get paid in full

[Verse: Rakim]
Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cause ain’t nothin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking, ""How could I get some dead presidents?""
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up: ""This is a hold-up, ain’t nothing funny
Stop smiling, be still, don’t nothing move but the money""
But now, I learned to earn 'cause I’m righteous
I feel great, so maybe, I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I’ll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistling this
Feeling out of place 'cause, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money, it’s still a wish
'Cause I don’t like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now's a test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cause I’m paid in full

[Outro: Eric B. and Rakim]
Rakim, check this out
Yo, you go to your girl's house and I'll go to mine
'Cause my girl is definitely mad 'cause it took us too long to do this album
Yo, I hear what you're saying, so let's just pump the music up and count our money
Yo, well check this out
Yo, Elai
Turn the bass down and just let the beat keep on rocking
And we outta here
Yo, what happened to peace?
Peace, peace, peace

1,I Need Love,Bigger And Deffer,LL Cool J,1987-07-22,322733,50,"

[Verse 1]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names
Then the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself, ""look what you've done to her""
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make-believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amor kissing you on the ear
Whispering, ""I love you and I'll always be here""
Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
One half of me deserves to be this way 'til I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy

[Hook]
I need love
I need love

[Verse 2]
Romance, sheer delight, how sweet?
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say, ""ooh girl, you're so sweet""
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do
But where you at? You're neither here or there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen?
Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide
And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside

[Hook]
I need love
I need love

[Verse 3]
I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold, you just love you
Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you
Grind, moan and never be alone
If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad
I've got money, but love's something I've never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's 10 feet tall
I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget

[Hook]
I need love
I need love

[Verse 4]
See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer
A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It's taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much
My body tingles all over from the slightest touch
Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time
Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you, girl, I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally find you watch our love unfurl

[Hook]
I need love
I need love

[Outro]
Girl, listen to me. When I be sitting in my room all alone, staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind, and I've come to realize that I need true love
And if you wanna give it to me, girl, make yourself seen. I'll be waiting
I love you

2,You're Gonna Get Yours,Yo! Bum Rush The Show,Public Enemy,1987-02-10,244040,27,"

[Flavor Flav]
Oh, Chuck, they out to get us, man
Yo, we got to dust these boys off

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
In this corner with the '98
Subject of suckers, object of hate
Who's the one some think is great?
I'm that one (son of a gun!)
Drivin' by wavin' my fist
Makin' 'em mad when I'm goin' like this
Top gun, never on the run
(They know not to come cause they all get some)
Goin' quicker in the speedin' lane
Jealous can't do it and it's causin' them pain
Caught in my smoke, all they did was choke
Look at my spokes, you know I'm no joke
Out that window, middle finger for all
Jealous at my ride, stereo and blackwalls
Suckers they got the nerve and gall
(To talk about the car when they're walkin' tall)

[Chorus]
Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)
Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
Pullin' away every day
Leavin' you in the dust so you know I get paid
On the mile ego trip and 5-0 tailin' on my tip
Watch me burn rubber, fall in my flame
This episode is always the same
Seein' no comp coming like I'm blind
All left back trailin' my behind
I go faster cops try to shoot me
They'll get theirs when they try to get me
I'll let it go, my turbo
Run 'em in the river cause they're movin' too slow
Laughing hard at their attempt
So what if the judge charges me contempt?
I'd rub my boomerang cause I'm feelin' proud
And I wouldn't even hear 'em cause my radio's loud

[Chorus]
Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)
Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)s

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
Cruisin' down the boulevard
I'm treated like some superstar
You know the time so don't look hard
(Get with it, the ultimate homeboy car!)
All you suckers in the other ride
Whenever I'm comin' get to my side
My '98 is tough to chase
If you're on my tail better watch your face
Smoke is comin' when I burn
Rubber when my wheels turn
Tinted windows, so super bad
Lookin' like the car the Green Hornet had
It's the reason I'm ahead of the pack
It's the reason I left them back
It's the reason all the people say
My '98 Olds blows 'em all away

[Bridge: Chuck D + sample]
My '98 Oldsmobile's so (""Su—"" ""Su—"" ""Su—"")
My '98 Oldsmobile is (""Su—"" ""Su—"" ""Su—"")
My '98 Oldsmobile's so (""Su—"" ""Su—"" ""Su—"")
My '98 Oldsmobile's like (""Super sperm"")

[Chorus]
Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)
Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)

[Verse 4: Chuck D]
Understand, I don't drive drunk
My '98's fly, I don't drive no junk
No cop got a right to call me a punk
Take this ticket, go to hell and stick it
Put me on a kick but line up, times up
This government needs a tune up
I don't even know what's happenin', what's up?
Gun in my chest, I'm under arrest
Sidewalk suckers wanted to spill me
So I got my crew and posse
Took the girls and got them to thrill me
Stepped outside, got in my ride
Drove 'em around and I looked around town
Caught 'em out there cold, ran 'em over and down
They didn't get me and that's the truth
('Cause my '98-O is bullet proof)

[Bridge: Chuck D + sample]
My '98 Oldsmobile's so (""Su—"" ""Su—"" ""Su—"")
My '98 Oldsmobile is (""Su—"" ""Su—"" ""Su—"")
My '98 Oldsmobile's so (""Su—"" ""Su—"" ""Su—"")
My '98 Oldsmobile's like (""Super sperm"")

[Chorus]
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west

[Verse 1]
I used to live downtown, 129th Street
Convent, everything's upbeat
Parties, ball in the park
Nothing, but girls after dark
We chill, nobody gets ill
In the place we call the hill
But if you try 'em
That's when they will
Get wild, but they don't fight, they kill
At the...

[Chorus]
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west

[Verse 2]
I remember parties out in the park
With the girlies, rubbing up in the dark
I was smooth, until someone pulled a gun
It was over, they spoiled my fun
I was flying, just like a track star
Dying, nah, I ran through the back yard
Trying to get into my building
Saying ""Why in the heck won't somebody kill them?""
One day the fellas got together
They vowed that no one would ever
Come on our block, and terrorize us
The gangs that used to do it, now they idolize us
Guns, we don't like to use them
Unless, our enemies choose them
We prefer to fight you on like a man
And beat you down with our hands and bodyslam you at the...

[Chorus]
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west

[Verse 3]
We don't start trouble, but boy do we end it
Our time, we like to spend it
Snapping, boy do we heat up
But we'll take time out to beat up
A sucker, if he wants static
Beatdown, yeah we got it
Good, and we'll accommodate you
Thanks to us, a lot of brothers hate to
Come back, to this very day
'Cause losing's one thing we don't play
If you're ever in a fight and you're beating one of us
Break out, before you get bumrushed
At the...

[Chorus]
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west

[Verse 4]
I'm talking about Nappy Red, Theo, Tony and Milton
Mike Mike Sluggo and Mike Chillion
D.O.B., Reggie B, and Sidney
Dano B, Derrick B, Sean B, and don't forget
Big Hank, Don Ice and Sire Rock
God bless Peter Wax, Chuck Chuck, and Pork Chop
El Dorado George way back in the day
Had all the brothers on the hill talking this way
They said, ""God, have mercy L.A
Sunshine"" and my DJ
Easy Lee, are from around the way
Jock Jock, Philly Phil, Don D always
But they're chillin', Keith Keith, KV
Steve O, Ross Ross and A Fi
Beroni, Toss Toss and Hung Hunk
We fight with our hands and nobody's a punk!
At the...

[Chorus]
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west
The wild wild west

4,Squeeze the Trigger,Rhyme Pays (Explicit Version),ICE-T,1987,374640,24,"

Yo Evil, what's up man? They be buggin', they won't play our records on the radio, man, say we violent, man. They need to look at the news, you know what I'm sayin'? They need to kill that noise. Man what you doin' with that up under your shirt? Aw, man, it's time we put some head out, word. Let's get busy, E. Come on, home boy

Squeeze the trigger

Man I'm tired of this nonsense, sweatin' my crew, tryin' to come to the show, searchin' my car, man I'm sick of the cops

Rampage on the stage, my crew's in a rage
Searched my posse, found the Uzi but missed the 12 gauge
Maniac, I'm a rhyme brainiac, livin' on the edge of a razor, remember that
Cold rollin' thick as a shake, I'm rockin' hard as a quake
I can live on bread and water or lobster and steak
My mind's a riot gun, there ain't none bigger
About to unload the ammo, E squeeze the trigger

(""You fight..."") Got 'im! (""...to live."")
""Police still have no leads for the apprehension of [?]""
""Has it ever occured to you? The president might be the one who wants you dead.""

They say I'm violent, they should watch the T.V
You say I'm brutal, you should check your P.D
You made me, now your kids rave me
I rap about the life that the city streets gave me
Murder, intrigue, somebody must bleed
Miami Vice is small time, L.A.'s the big league
From the Rollin' '60s to the Nickerson G's
Pueblos, Grape Street, this is what I see
The Jungle, the '30s, the V.N.G
Life in L.A. ain't no cup of tea
And they be sayin' I'm illin', yo

Squeeze the trigger
Got 'im!

""Violence erupts at a Los Angeles hip-hop concert. Rap music is blamed for violence
Violence erupts at a New York hockey game. Hockey is blamed for violence
Violence breaks out at a European soccer game. Soccer is blamed for violence
Violence breaks out at a nuclear peace rally. Peace is blamed for violence.""

I've been dogged out by cops, shackled and socked
Paid my dues to the streets, took my hard knocks
Disrespected by snobs, damn near trampled by mobs
Persecuted by squares workin' nine to five jobs
But like a panther I prowl, like a lion I growl
Learn to see behind my back like the head of an owl
I'm the voice of the youth, the prophet of truth
What I speak is reality though some may say ruth-
-less tactics are takin' by me to awaken
People to life but I feel no fakin'
No jivin', no lyin', no frontin', no playin'
Say exactly what's up, understand what I'm sayin'
Ban me, try it, you might cause a riot
What the radio won't play, the underground will supply it
I'm an MC pirate that's loud, not quiet
Radical as they make'em, make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise, some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
With most due respect the words I inject
Kick credit for realism and the truth I project
Because I could bust rhymes for fun, or cut MC's like a knife
But the topic I love is the drama of life
So don't diss me don't dare, I feel you should care
You may think I'm soft but you're just unaware
Of the wrath of the Ice enraged, prepare
For a true nightmare

Squeeze the trigger

Cops hate kids, kids hate cops, cops kill kids with warnin' shots
What is crime and what is not? What is justice? I think I forgot
We buy weapons to keep us strong
Reagan sends guns where they don't belong
The controversy is thick and the drag is strong
But no matter the lies we all know who's wrong
Homeless sleep on the city streets
Waitin' to die with nothin' to eat
While rich politicians soak their feet
In the pools at their ten million buck retreats
People hate people for color of face
No one had a choice in the race we were placed
A brother in Queens was beaten and chased
Murdered cold in the streets, a goddamn disgrace
Just because of his race, his life went to waste
And no one went to jail when the court heard the case
Justice or corruption? It's all interlaced
How can you swallow this? I can't stand the taste

Squeeze the trigger

[?]

I get paid for illin', cold makin' a killin'
My pockets keep fillin', I got dollars to the ceilin'
Got a safe in my floor, car got bullet-proof doors
Every time I rock the mic I leave you wishin' for more
Because my raps ain't bull, got cold stupid pull
You wanna eat my rhymes like candy, 'til your mind's over full
But most MC's today ain't got nothin' to say
A to the motherfuckin' K

Squeeze the trigger

Yo E, man, i'm tired of this, let's call up the posse, let's end this noise, word

Now you think you know what time it is? Word, we out of here

""Los Angeles rapper Ice-T's records banned because [?] reality""

[Outro]
This album is dedicated to Rhyme Syndicate
They hear my records before they're made
When they're just on paper, when they're demos laid
At 6am when the cops run their raid
We don't worry about suckas 'cause they will get sprayed
PEACE

5,Poetry,Criminal Minded (Deluxe),Boogie Down Productions,1987,299630,26,"

[Verse 1]
Well, now you're forced to listen to the teacher and the lesson
Class is in session, so you can stop guessing
If this is a tape or a written down memo
See, I am a professional, this is not a demo
In fact, call it a lecture, a visual picture
Sort of a poetic and rhythm-like mixture
Listen, I'm not dissing, but there's something that you're missing
Maybe you should touch reality, stop wishing
For beats with plenty bass and lyrics said in haste
If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest
I am a poet, you try to show it, yet blow it
It takes concentration for fresh communication
Observation, that is to see without speaking
Take off your coat, take notes, I am teaching
A class, or rather school, 'cause you need schooling
I am not a king or queen, I'm not ruling
This is an introduction to poetry
A small dedication to those that might know of me
They might know of you and maybe your gang
But one thing's for sure, neither one of y'all can hang
'Cause, yo, I'm like a arrow, and Scott is the crossbow
Say something now... thought so
You seem to be the type that only understand
The annihilation and destruction of the next man
That's not poetry, that is insanity
It's simply fantasy, far from reality
Poetry is the language of imagination
Poetry is a form of positive creation
Difficult, isn't it? The point? You're missing it
Your face is in front of my hand so I'm dissing it

[Verse 2]
Scott La Rock is innovating, decorating hip-hop
The beat may drop but not like all the others
They just cover while I just smother
Every single stupid mother-- wait, wait, brother
KRS-One will have to show another
MC or self-proclaimed king or queen
Or gang or crew or solo or team that I mean
Business, so tell me, what is this?
See, I come from the Bronx, so just kiss this
Boogie Down Productions is somewhat an experiment
The antidote for sucker MC's and they're fearing it
It's self-explanatory, no one's writing for me
The poetry I'm rattling is really not for battling
But if you want, I will simply change the program
So when I'm done you will simply say ""Damn!""
So this conversation is somewhat hypothetical
Boogie Down Productions attempts to prove something
I say hypothetical because it's only theory
My theory, so take a minute now to hear me

[Verse 3]
So what's your problem?
It seems you want to be KRS too
From my point of view, backtrack, stop the attack
Cos KRS-One means simply one KRS
That's it, that's all, solo, single, no more, no less
I've built up my credential financially and mental
Anytime I rhyme I request the instrumental
I speak clearly and that's merely
Or should I say a mere, help to my career
I'm really not into fashion or craze
Just the one who pays and how soon I get a raise
You're probably in a daze, acting out of sympathy
Wrote a couple of rhymes and think that you can get with me
But what a pity, I'm rocking New York City
And everywhere else, you put the jams on the shelf
You as an amateur is outspoken
I'm looking at your face, you seem to be hoping
That I might stutter, stop, or just mess up
But everything's live that's why I don't dress up
""Blastmaster KRS"" a synonym for ""fresh""
I'm the teacher of the class, I do not pass no test
Got DJ Scott La Rock by my side, not in back of me
Cos we make up the Boogie Down Productions crew faculty
Get it right, or train yourself not to bite
Cos when you bite you have bitten, when I hear it, that's it
I do not contemplate a battle cause it really ain't worth it
I'd rather point a pistol at your head and try to burst it

I'm teaching poetry
I'm teaching poetry
Scott La Rock
We're teaching po-e-try

6,I'm Bad,Bigger And Deffer,LL Cool J,1987-07-22,279733,51,"

[Intro]
Calling all cars, calling all cars...
Be on the lookout for a tall light-skinned brother with dimples
Wearing a black Kangol, sweatsuit, gold chain, and sneakers.
Last seen on Farmers Boulevard headed east.
Alias L.L. Cool J. He's bad...

[Verse 1]
Aaaahhhhhhhhhh
No rapper can rap quite like I can
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso, I'm a MC cop
Make you say ""Go LL,"" and do the Wop
If you think you can outrhyme me, yeah boy I bet
Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet
Trendsetter, I'm better, my rhymes are good
I got a gold nameplate that says ""I wish you would""
And when battles begin then I gotta join in and
Before my rhyme is over, you know I'mma win
Cool J has arrived so you better make way
Ask anybody in the crowd, they say the kid don't play
Slaughter competition, that's my hobby and job
I don't wear a disguise because I don't owe the mob
Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped
So many girls on my jock, I think my phone is tapped
I'm bad

Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J

[Verse 2]
I'm like Tyson, icin', I'm a soldier at war
I'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more
Got concrete rhymes, been rappin' for ten years and
Even when I'm bragging, I'm bein' sincere!
Emcees can't win, I make 'em rust like tin
They call me 'Jaws,' my hat is like a shark's fin
Because I'm bad as can be, got my voice on wax
Some brothers think he's making records, now he must have relaxed
I couldn't, I shouldn't, and it'll stay that way
The best rapper you've heard is LL Cool J
Kamikaze, take a look at what I've done
Used to rock in my basement, now I'm number one
And can happen on time, never standin' on line
You wanna try me? First you better learn how to rhyme
I'm the pinnacle; that means I reign supreme
And I'm notorious; I'll crush you like a jellybean!
I'm bad

""Suspect was last spotted with three other members of his group. Bobcat, E Love and the Cut Creator. They are extremely bad, so keep your eyes open. Use extreme caution""

[Verse 3]
I eliminate punks, cut 'em up in chunks
You were souped, you heard me, and your ego shrunk
I'm devastating I'm so good it's a shame
Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane
I'm as strong as a bull of course you know why I pull
I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full
Not Buckaroo Banzai, but bustin' out as I
Say the kind of rhymes that make MC's wish that I'd die
Never retire or put my mic on the shelf
The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself
Not bitter or mad, just provin' I'm bad
You want a hit? Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad!
MC's retreat, cause they know I can beat 'em
And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em
I'm the baddest! Takin' out all rookies
So forget Oreos, eat Cool J cookies, I'm bad!

Cool J, Cool J,Cool J,Cool J, Cool J,Cool J

[Verse 4]
Never ever no never
Never wearin' no Levis, battle me why try?
I'll treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy ""bye bye""
Slaughterin' MC's and I'mma never get whipped
When I retire I'll get worshipped like a old battleship
LL I'm bad, all the rappers know
When I enter the center they say, 'Yo, yo there he go!'
My paycheck's large Mr. Bogart in charge
Not a puncher or hunter from a raccoon lodge
The original Todd, teachin' how to be hard
Take the skin off a snake, and split a pea from a pod
You're a novice I'm noble and I decipher my tongue
Not Attila the Hun, nor Abdullah his son
My vocals exact, like rack and pinion in a Jag
You try to brag, you get your rhymes from a grab-bag
No good scavenger, catfish vulture
My tongue's a chisel and this composition's sculpture, I'm bad!

[Outro]
(Think I'm gonna need backup)
(Think I'm gonna need backup)

Gimme that walkie-talkie!
Yo this is LL Cool J
And you'll never catch me so don't even try it
Cause I'm too bad for ya, understand?!
Aaaaaahhhh... I'm bad!

7,I Ain't No Joke,Paid In Full,Eric B. & Rakim,1987,232893,42,"

[Verse 1]
I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on 'cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffitti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration 'cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
'Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
Competing 'cause I just put your mind on pause
And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours
I wake you up, and as I stare in your face, you seem stunned
Remember me? The one you got your idea from?
But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher
When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of
Biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should've broke because I ain't no joke

[Verse 2]
I got a question as serious as cancer:
Who can keep the average dancer hyper as a heart attack?
Nobody smiling
'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it, so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all my hip-hop hits
Get the style down pat, then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours
The E-M-C-E-E, don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream, and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around—that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those seven emcees
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play sound familiar
I'll wait 'til E say, ""Play 'em""
So I'mma have to diss and broke
You could get a smack for this—I ain't no joke

[Verse 3]
I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation 'cause what I invent
I nominated my DJ for president
When I emcee, I'll keep a freestyle going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
There'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiending
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the moral of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
'Cause I'm moving the crowd, and B'll wreck the fader
No interruptions, and the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
'Cause everything is real, on a serious tip
Keep playing and I get furious quick
And I'll take you for a walk through hell
Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple-stage darkness
When it get dark again, then I'ma spark this microphone
'Cause the heat is on, you see smoke
And I'm finished when the beat is gone— I'm no joke

8,The Overweight Lovers In The House,Living Large,Heavy D & The Boyz,1987-10-25,217493,35,"

[Verse 1]
Sittin' in my room with my smokin' jacket on
The fireplace is burning and the girly is WARM
Time to make my move, so gently I kiss her
Whisper in her ear, and tell her that I miss her
She might try to pop that boyfriend junk
But I don't really care because I know he's a punk
I'll stomp him like a roach if he tries to approach
He can't get close cause I'm the one who wrote
The Book of Romance, so come on take a chance
You don't need a long look, all you need is a glance
If you wanna get warm, in my arms you belong
You have a problem, Hev will solve 'em, nothin' can go wrong - when

[Chorus]
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House

[Verse 2]
You said I couldn't do it, then it got done
And after you and I did it, you said it was fun
Now every day of your life you wanna be with me
When you got time to spend you spend time with Heavy D
I notice that you hold me gentle as a rose
I'm rough and tough baby, but then I suppose
That I had to be held in order to start holdin'
I think I got you hittin', so let's start rollin'

[Chorus]
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House

[Verse 3]
Heaven sent on our trip, champagne we sip
You look at me I look at you, then we touch lips
We roll around in the sand, later on hold hands
Walk by the beach and I can teach ya Heavy D's game plan
See the way that I am, is the Big Loverman
Check out the rhyme and in due time you'll be a Hev D fan
I'm swift you know, an Overweight Romeo
Come get a piece of the beast, because it's good to go
Emcee Heavy D all ladies I'm hookin'
Big extra love but STILL good lookin'
For you and I to swing on our romance free
All you gotta do is lean on me, because

[Chorus]
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House

[Verse 4]
I'm an overweight lover, entertainer of many
Now when I do a party now I may not do plenty
Girls out the crowd seem to go berserk
They start yellin' and screamin' ""HEAVY D GO TO WORK""
And when I'm through rockin' and chillin' at the disco
They grab me up and scoop me up, they just won't let go
That's when I know that there's been too much charmin'
I put 'em in a line and say ""Please don't squeeze the Charmin'""

[Chorus]
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House
The Overweight Lover's in the House

9,How Ya Like Me Now,How Ya Like Me Now (Expanded Edition),Kool Moe Dee,1987-12-08,337333,43,"

[Produced by Teddy Riley]

[Verse 1]
I throw my tape on then, I watch ya
Three seconds later, I got ya
Shakin' your head, dancin' instead of sittin'
The rhymes kick, the beats hittin' you
Just like a home run, slammin' like a slam dunk
Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC get paid
Usin' my rap style
And I'm playin' the background meanwhile
I ain't with that, you can't forget that
You took my style, I'm takin' it back
Comin' back, like ""Return of the Jedi""
Sucker MC's in the place that said I
Could only rock rhymes and only rock crowds
But never rock records, how ya like me now?

[Chorus]
How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?

[Verse 2]
Now brothers are riding me like a pony
I'm no phony, I'm the only real mic-aroni
Playin' the mic like it's supposed to be played
New jacks, you all shoulda stayed
Out of the business, what is this
Amateur night at the Apollo?
Get off this stage, I'm in a rage
I'm like a lion that's been trapped inside a cage
I'm the real king, rap is a jungle
I never understood, how could one go
To a party, watch me, stand around and jock me
Become a rapper, then try to rock me
Schemin' like a demon, you're screamin' and dreamin'
I'm from the old school, I used to see men
Die for less, but I'm not living that way
I'll let my mic do the talkin'
And let the music play

[Chorus]
How ya like me now?

[Verse 3]
Rap is an art and I'm like Picasso
But of course, why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya
Self in my shoes, but they won't fit ya
I'm bigger and better, forget about deffer
Every time I rocked the mic, I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me
Again, respect, I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of perfect
Vernacular's pure and I can ensure
Life or death with my breath, my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MC's, I'll make your girl say, ""Ow""
And she's jockin', now how ya like me now?

[Chorus]
How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?

[Verse 4]
It irked my nerve when I heard
A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve
Run around town sayin' he is the best
Is that a test? I'm not impressed
Get real, you're nothing but a toy
Don't ya know that I'll serve that boy?
Just like a waiter, hit 'em with a plate of
These fresh rhymes and
Make sure that he pay the bill
And leave him standin' still
When he's had enough, hit him with a refill
And for dessert it won't be no ice cream
I'm just gonna shatter and splatter his pipe dreams
Make him feel the wrath, beat him down, and laugh
And when I finish, then I'm gonna ask him
""Who is the best?"" And if he don't say, ""Moe Dee""
I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby
Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat
Always talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet
But if we ever did, how could you beat me?
You're so petrified, you're scared to even meet me
My word's the law, that's why you don't beef
You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief
So I'm puttin' you on punishment, just like a child
Never touch another mic, how ya like me now?

[Chorus]
How ya like me now?

[Verse 5]
I could continue, there's more on the menu
But I'll relax 'cause I'm so far in you
You had enough, I know you're overstuffed
And if I keep going, you'll be throwin' up
Old rhymes I used to say way back in the day
When you used to come to my parties and pay
Nobody's ever gonna rock me and this I vow
So all I wanna say is how ya like me now?

[Chorus]
How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?

10,Public Enemy No.1,Yo! Bum Rush The Show,Public Enemy,1987-02-10,281066,3,"

[Produced by Bill Stephney]

[Intro: Flavor Flav and Chuck D]
Yo Chuck, bust a move man
I was on my way up here to the studio, you know what I'm saying?
And this brother stopped me and asked me, ""Yo, what's up with that brother Chuckie D, he swear he nice?""
I said, ""Yo, the brother don't swear he nice, he knows he's nice"", you know what I'm saying?
So Chuck, we got a feeling you turning into a Public Enemy, man
Now remember that line you was kicking to me on the way out to L.A. Laurelton Queens while we was in the car on our way to the shop?
Well yo, right now, kick the bass for them brothers and let 'em know... What, goes, on!
What goes on? Well...

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
I'm all in, put it up on the board
Another rapper shot down from the mouth that roared
One, two, three - down for the count
The result of my lyrics, oh yes, no doubt
Cold rock rap, forty-niner supreme
Is what I choose and I use, I never lose to a team
'Cause I can go solo like a Tyson bolo
Make the fly girls wanna have my photo
Run in their room, hang it on the wall
In remembrance that I rocked them all
Suckers, ducks, ho-hum emcees
You can't rock the kid, so go cut the cheese
Take this application of rhymes like these
My rap's red hot, hundred ten degrees
So don't start bassing, I'll start placing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
You and your mind from my beating from my rhymes
A time for a crime that I can't find
I'll show you my gun, my Uzi weighs a ton
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

[Hook]
One, one, one
One, one, one, one!
(One, one, one, hoo-hah!)

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
You got no rap, but you want to battle
It's like having a boat, but you've got no paddle
'Cause I never pause, I say it because
I don't break in stores, but I break all laws
Written while sitting, all bidding not hidden
Giving me the juice that you're not getting
I'm not a law obeyer, so you can tell your mayor
I'm a non-stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the rhyme player, the ozone layer
A battle what? Here's a bible, start your prayer
This word to the wise is justified
If they ask you what happened, just admit you lied
You just got caught up for going out of order
And now you're serving football teams their water
You messed with the Master, word to Chuck
And I waxed cold taxed, make sure you got dunked
You just got dissed, all but dismissed
Sucker duck emcees, you get me pissed
It's no fun being on the run
Because they got me Public Enemy number one

[Hook]
One, one, one
One, one, one, one!
Don't you know, don't you know

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
I got a posse of a force to back me up
Watch out, we got mettle to match
Ambush attack on my back, double-team you get creamed
So we have it, so you won't catch
Wanna hear it again we got a force, enemy down
The L-I circuit sound
And Chuckie D, myself, and K-Jee
Flavor, DJ Melo-D
Oh yes, I presume it's the tunes that make us groom
To make all the ladies swoon
But it's also the words from our direction, the homeboy section
Kicking like Bruce Lee's ""Chinese Connection""
On stereo, never ever mono
On wax, yes, I'm talking about vinyl
They said ""Stop! Freeze!"", I got froze up
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

[Hook]
One, one, one
One, one, one
One, one, one!
For all you

[Verse 4: Chuck D]
Suckers, liars, your cheap amplifiers
Your crossed up wires are always starting fires
You grown up criers, now here's a pair of pliers
Get a job like your mother, heard she fixes old dryers
You have no desires, your father fixes tires
You try to sell your equipment but you get no buyers
It's you they never hire, you're never on flyers
'Cause you and your crew is only known as good triers
Known as the poetic, political, lyrical son
I'm Public Enemy number one

[Hook]
One, one, one
One, one, one
One, one, one!

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
Yeah, that's right Chuck, man
That's what you gotta do
You gotta tell 'em just like that, you know what I'm saying
'Cause yo man, let me tell you a little something man
These brothers running around, hard headed
They get a little jealous, you know what I'm saying
Just like that, you know, they're trying to bring you down with them
But yo Chuck, you got to let them know who's who in the world to be
You got to let them know, that this is the 80's
And we can get all the ladies
And in the backyard we got a fly Mercedes
And that's the way the story goes
That's just the way the story goes
Let me tell you a little something man

12,6 'N the Mornin',Rhyme Pays (Explicit Version),ICE-T,1987,224866,47,"

[Verse 1]
6 in the morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window I make my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music, but happy 'cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistols close at hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]
Word

[Verse 2]
Seen my homeboys cooling way, way out
Told 'em 'bout my morning cold bugged 'em out
Shot a little dice till my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories 'bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly, simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit
As we walked over to her, ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]
Word

[Verse 3]
Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in a Blazer with a Louis interior
Solid gold, the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin' off like a high school bell
Looked in the mirror, what did we see?
Fucking blue lights: L.A.P.D
Pigs searched our car, their day was made
Found an Uzi, .44 and a hand grenade
Threw me in the county high-power block
No freaks to see, no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble but the shit must fly
Squabbled with this sucker, shanked him in the eye
But just living in the county is a serious task
Nigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later, but still had the juice
My homeboy Hen Gee put me up the track
Told me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack
Bruce is a giant - Nat C's clocking dough
Be-Bop's a pimp, my old freak's a ho
The batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said, ""Man, you out early, we thought you got ten""
Opened his safe, kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I bought a Benz with the money, the rest went on clothes
Went to the strip, started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done, on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint, but fly to my heart
I didn't want trouble, but the shit had to start
Out with my crew, some punks got loud
Shotgun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit, two punks died
All causalities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 6]
Swat-team leader yelled, ""Hit the floor""
Reached in my pocket, pulled my .44
Dove across the room, peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the backdoor like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley, jumped into a car
Suckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind
Black wire touched red, the car was mine
We hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn, goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 7]
The rollers gave chase at a serious speed
One more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di
'Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew, we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun
And all I was thinking was, murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew, we're gone into the night
Broke to my old lady's who drew me a bath
She didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

[Verse 8]
We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie, a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV
A technician with a mission, that's what she was
If there had been a crowd she would've got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
Then she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum
Then she cold got stupid, pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop as I was screaming for more
After she waxed my body, she let me crash
She knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 9]
Up the next morning, feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my A.M.G
Ho's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile, yes, cellular
Got to have a phone when I'm in my car
Was my homeboy Red, some say he's insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said he's jumping bail, said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
Didn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

[Verse 10]
Fell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C
Called up my posse when I got there
Hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devil's nest, the rest we passed
Back-door'd the Palladium just for class
About 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce
We never catch static 'cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shoot-out jumped off, nine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast
But it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask

[Hook]

13,Kanday,Bigger And Deffer,LL Cool J,1987-07-22,239573,29,"

[Verse 1]
I met this new girl with big juicy lips
And nice round hips, I mean her body's a trip
And when I go over her house, you know what I like?
The way she tells me ""take it off"" and never says ""syke""
Yo, I'm never in need, she's feedin my greed
She never waits for me to ask, she takes the lead
Her tongue is sticky, and hickeys are her specialty
E wants her, but she saves the good stuff for me
Her name is Kanday, she's dandier than Dandy Don
You're mad and I'm happy that she put me on
I'll never leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that

[Chorus]
(I feel good) about Kanday

[Verse 2]
Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
Brothers beg for the leg, she's on the cheerleading team
It feels wicked, everytime I stick it, that's right
When we're alone she never ever acts polite
Hey yo, she blows me kisses, she does my dishes
I wished I bust two and she grants my wishes
She's clever in bed, she uses her head
She's the kinda girl that keeps a fat man well fed
Left to right all night, the chick's outta sight
I broke my lamp shade in half because I don't use a light
Man, she's juicy like a berry, chocolate with the cherry
Ask me if it's good and I'll have to say very
Wouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that

[Chorus]
(I feel good) about Kanday

[Verse 3]
I'm feelin gooder than good, if you wouldn't I would
If you could, I know you could, she's kickin back in the hood
When she starts to get off she can knock off a cough
I know 'cough' don't rhyme with 'boss', but she made me her boss
She's the talk of my room whenever I'm in my room
My little brother loves her more than his favorite cartoon
Her body's bad, the girl's built, skin like silk
Wet, steamy and warm just like a hot cup of milk
She's all the way live, keeps me satisfied
I don't go outside, I like to stay inside
Her ways are like an angel, with bright white wings
And I'm crazy 'bout the way Kanday shakes her thing
Wouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that

[Chorus]
(I feel good) about Kanday

[Verse 4]
Ooh, you couldn't imagine, I'm lickin my lips
If she was tea I'd take a sip, when I'm in gym I do flips
I'm in love with the pizznoot, it's proper as hell
I'm hittin harder than hard, always makin her yell
She's cooler than an iceberg, word to the mother
In the house, down the steps and under the covers
Right away, no sation, or frontin, or playin
Or delayin, I'm never steppin off, I'm always stayin
Her mother knows me well, father hates my guts
He don't know when we're alone she's always feelin on my niggy-niggy-nuts
For a snack, cornflakes, crackerjacks
Day after day I try to break that back
And man, oh man, damn, you can't and I can
Last time I saw her ex-man, I had to shake homeboys' hand
I said ""what up"", he said ""what up"", ""I took your girl, so what up?""
Gotta walk on the ground with a hole to fill up
All the boys laugh about her, Darryl and Dewayne
Bobcat and Earl, but they must be insane
Michael Spelling's on my side, and big Chuck agrees
She's my private freaky deak, my own personal skeez
Wouldn't leave her for nothin, only a crazy man would
That's why I had to tell ya that (I - feel - good)

[Chorus]
(I feel good) about Kanday

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
You see me coming in de dance with the spliff of sensei
Down with the sound called BDP
If you want to join the crew, well you must see me
You can't sound like Shan or the one Marley
Because Shan and Marley Marl dem a rhyming like they gay
Picking up the mic, man, dem don't know what to say
Saying Hip Hop started out in Queensbridge
Saying lies like that, man, you know dem can't live
So I tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan!
Tell them again, me come to tell them again!
Tell them again, me come to tell them again, gwan!
Tell them again, me come to tell them
Manhattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it
Bronx keeps creating it, and Queens keeps on faking it

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Di-di di-da, di-di-di, dida di-day, aiy!
All you sucker MCs, won't you please come out to play (Cause)
Here's an example of KRS-One (Bo!)
Here's an example of KRS-One
They wish to battle BDP but they cannot
They must be on the dick of who? DJ Scott La Rock
Cause we don't complain nor do we play the game of favors
Boogie Down Productions comes in three different flavors
Pick any dick for the flavor that you savor
Mr. Magic might wish to come and try to save ya
But instead of helping ya out he wants the same thing I gave ya
I finally figured it out, Magic mouth is used for sucking
Roxanne Shante is only good for steady fucking
MC Shan and Marley Marl is really only bluffing
Like Doug E. Fresh said, “I tell you now, you ain't nothing”
Compared to Red Alert on KISS and Boogie Down Productions
So easy now man, I me say easy now man
To KRS-One, you know dem can't understand
Me moving over there and then me moving over here
The name of this routine is called ""Live At Union Square""
Square, square, square, ooooooooooooooooooooooo
What's the matter with your MC, Marley Marl?
Don't you know that he's out of touch
What's the matter with your DJ, MC Shan?
On the wheels of steel Marlon sucks
You'd better change what comes out your speaker
You're better off talking 'bout your wack Puma sneaker
'Cause Bronx created Hip-Hop, Queens will only get dropped
You're still telling lies to me
Everybody's talking 'bout the Juice Crew funny
But you're still telling lies to me

[Intro]
Ladies and gentleman
We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight
They just came from off tour
They wanna tell you a little story about where they come from

[Hook] x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Verse 1]
You love to hear the story again and again
Of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place

[Hook] x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Verse 2]
Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name, it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean T-Tom
A brother who's known for his rap - Jappy Jap
Larry Larr, third least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
Phase Brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door get frisked, just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town then you couldn't fight and win
But every time they had a jam they couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there in the parks they had to cease
'Cause you was in

[Hook] x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Verse 3]
Why don't you wise up show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit your ass had better run
Cause you're in

[Hook] x3
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Verse 4]
Dimples D the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was ""Sucker DJ's""
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn out
By any place any part of the world
And while I'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl
While she's in

[Hook] x7
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Verse 5]
Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you may
Don't ever listen to what nobody say
'Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
'Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
They're trying to lead your destiny
By the time you think about it you're grown
Then you say goddamn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Which people always pulling always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pulling you back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause they're not with it
You're talking about school
They're talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time will fly
But you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal 'cause I'm reaching for mine
And I'm from

[Hook] x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

[Outro]
Keep on rocking, the bridge will keep rocking
If the beats stop rocking the bridge will keep rocking
If the beats start rocking the bridge will keep rocking
*repeated*

Ladies and gentleman
We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight

[Intro: Flavor Flav]
Hey, Chuck, we got some non-believers out there…
Yo, we got to do somethin' about that, man…
Yo, we got to get stupid
Yo, we gotta let ‘em know what time it is

[Chuck D]
You go ooh and aah when I jump in my car
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
No matter who you are, when I'm up to par
I betcha go hip hop, hurray or hurrah
But the aahs and oohs is my kind of news
Pop your tape in, put your car in cruise
I never heard the boos, I never drank booze
Cause I just rock the rhythm, left alone the blues
The L.I. mystique, you sneak to peek
A look and then you know that we're never weak
I know you can't wait, it's never too late
No fear I'm here, and everything is straight
Cycles, cycles, life runs in cycles
New is old, no I'm not no psycho
The monkey on the back makes the best excel
The people in the crowd makes the rock well
The people in the back lets you know who's wack
And those who lack, the odds are stacked
The one who makes the money is white not black
You might not believe it but it is like that
When you come to my show, watch me throw
Down with the other brothers toe to toe
When you make a move, new not used
And watch the bro here just bust a groove
A fat lady soprano, loads my ammo
Hear my jam with a funky piano
Easy on the wall but hard on the panel
A fool smokes Kools cause he chokes on Camels
In effect, the crew's in check
Run by the posse with the gold around the neck
Homeboy's in heat, lookin' for sweet
Ladies in the crowd so they can meet
Somebody to body, makin' a baby
Givin' it to grandma then makin' her crazy
I'm a MC protector, U.S. defector
South African government wrecker
Panther power, you can feel it in my arm
Lookout y'all cause I'm a timebomb
Tickin', tockin', all about rockin'
Makin' much dollars while the crazy one's clockin'
The rhythm, to shake the house downy down
Bounce to the ounce, sound so crown
The man, the enemy, Public King, no thing
All fall to the force of my swing
Like Ali, Frazier, Thriller in Manila
Pinpoint, point blank, microphone killer
Am I, no need to lie, got the Flavor Flav
To prove I'll win and if not the save
I'll pick up, rack up - put your whole shack up
Just choose to lose the bet, emcee stick up
This is the wiz, but the mic's not his
It's mine, one time, let the star shine
And I'm tellin' you, yellin' at you -  you're through
Don't think you're grown 'cause your moustache grew
I'm number one, you know it weighs a ton
And I'll be the burger, you can be the bun, girl
Surroundin', my steady poundin'
Get on down to my funky sound, and
Rock the rhythm rhyme, one time your mind
Rhythm roll, two time control
The mauler and the caller of your doom
And when I'm ready to leave, you're gonna know I go boom
Three times y'all, rhythm rhyme and rock
Then you'll that the D is on the block
Four times y'all and never ever the wack
It's the hour to the minute, time to blow BLACK

17,Mr. Big Stuff - Remix,Living Large,Heavy D & The Boyz,1987-10-25,202933,29,"

[Verse 1]
I'm rough and tough and all that stuff
I'll make you dance and prance 'til you huff and puff
There's just no way you can get enough
Of me, yo' Mister Big Stuff
I'm the overweighter, prince dominator
Emcee Heavy D, constant weight gainer
And since I choose the weight not to lose
I will stay this way so that I can bruise
Emcees around who front and frown
You go round for round, I go pound for pound
At the end of the party when you're sayin' goodnight
Don't come to me and say, ""Take it light"", I'm your Mr. Big Stuff

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Who— Who— Who— Who— Who—

[Verse 2]
I'm quick, rhyme shooter, rap rookie recruiter
I always say could, never, ever say coulda
I'm healthy and stacked, not a beast or fat
I get applause and awards every time I rap
I love the way I am, I would never switch
I'm the greatest entertainer since a porno flick
You move and groove to my funky tune
Party people, it's TIME to make room for your Mr. Big Stuff

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Who— Who— Who— Who— Who— (Rock it)

[Verse 3]
""Big Stuff"", the record, me, the mastermind
A top dollar money better, go get a designer
A fly girl lover and a woman pleaser
Girls come to me say, ""Heavy, let me squeeze ya""
An incredible, overweight huggable
Prince, a bold treat, that's why I'm so lovable
I got the knack to keep the fly girls shovin'
Two hundred and sixty pounds of good lovin'
They all want me, emcee Hev D
The more of the beef the more there is to squeeze
Got the juice to get loose, make you all get up
You want a swig, give me a ring, Heavy D, your Mr. Big Stuff

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Who— Who— Who— Who— Who— (Eddie F., breakdown)

[Bridge]
Who— Who—

[Verse 4]
Now I'm the swing beat artist with skills to kill
Money earnin' Mount Vernon's where I live and chill
When I walk the streets, I get much respect
Get hellos and whatnots from the youngins and the vets
'Cause I never been beaten, rhymes are pre-sweetened
Duck, punk panty emcees, stop retreatin'
'Cause on Heavy D, you shouldn't be sleepin'
Takin' dirty emcees away, I'm sweepin'
Got a tower of power, emcees I devour
Every second of the hour, I send 'em to the shower
I'm cool, not a fool, from the new school
Drinkin' brew by my pool, sittin' on my gold stool
Gotta rock, that I drop, like a horse on the trot
When it comes to makin' money, it takes what I got
I know you're sayin' to yourself you can't get enough
But I'll be back to attack, Heavy D, your Mr. Big Stuff

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah
Who— Who— Who— Who— Who—
Oh, yeah
Who— Who— Who— Who— Who—

L.L. Cool J
Servin em well
And as you all know..
I AM - HARD - AS HELL

Woke up at 9:30 on a Saturday morn'
Hemmed my remote control, turned my stereo on
Then I reached for a brush since I don't use the picks
And the floor was kinda cold, so I put on my kicks
Walked to the kitchen and ate some cornflakes
As I bop to a tape of Cut Creator's breaks
With hardcore - heavyweight - b-boy blast
Connoisseur of hardcore, and Cut Creator's fast
Jumped in the shower, it was boiling hot
So I stayed there a hour, cause I like it a lot
Jumped out, dried off, put on the Devin cologne
Then I called up Earl on the telephone
He told me 'bout a jam that I could do later on
10 g's plus a limo for one strong song
So I said, yeah, I was with it, hung up and got geared
Got a magnfying glass, then I brushed my beard
Rewound some tapes of some Def Jam tunes
As I waited for this freak to ring my bell at noon
12 o'clock came, left the door crack
The freak walked in, a mink on her back
Put her coat on the rack, threw my [sess robe?] on
Then I threw in a tape of the quiet storm
We drank Round Hill Cabernet Sauvignon
She said, ""L.L., when you're gonna let me taste your tongue?""
My skin got pale, I wam-bammed the tail
Did it so hard I shoulda went to jail
She left, Earl came over and we went outside
Jumped in the BM to bust a joyride
Went up to A.J., in my fresh black wheel
I'm not a sucker on the corner tryin to scrape up a meal
The girlies want sex, the fellas try to plex
But those who flex end up with broke necks
Signed some autographs for a posse of freaks
Said, ""It's L, baby, I ain't down with Chic""
Conversated with the skeezers for 10 minutes more
Then I jumped in my ride and the freaks slammed the door
Due cause I'm a gangster people think I do crimes
They don't know I'm just a connoisseur of hip-hop rhymes
Some smile, try to call L.L. a hoodlum at times
But he don't know my autograph's on his wife's behind
L.L. has iced all the washed up slobs
Vigilante of rap, so to hell with the mob
Don't run from the cops, makin suckers jock
And I'm only 18 makin more than your pops
Tormentor of toys and boyscout boys
And I dare any critic to call it noise
Peeped at the clock, it said 6:03
Said 'later' to Creator and broke out with E
Went up to White Castle for a chocolate shake
Thinkin 'bout a 100,000 that I'd soon make
Finished up the snack, jumped up, out my seat
E-Love hit the table and he made up a beat
Kicked a few lines, stepped out the door
Said ""Tonight is a bore, I'm in the mood for more""
We jumped in my ride, I took a peek at the time
It was almost 7:30 and the show was at nine
L.L. Cool J will soon stand at a jam
With thousands of people screamin, ""Touch my hand!""
But since I had a hour plus a half attached
I was searchin for the cutie who's my perfect match
Her name was Renee, her face was okay
But she had the kinda body that made Jay wanna play
I said, ""No need to rehearse,"" then I made my approach
Said, ""You got a good team, girl, but you need a new coach""
Said, ""My name's L.L. - Cool, if I may introduce
But I'm not here for conversation, I'm here to seduce
Wanna mix it up, baby, wanna feel you grind
Cause it ain't 5th grade, and these ain't nursery rhymes
And I know that you adore my sure side hardcore
Check out the real L.L. behind closed doors
So tell your buddies you're busy, tell your boyfriend beat it
Forget the silk dress,cause you ain't gonna need it
Unplug your clock, do away with the light
After five minutes or more you hear me say, 'That's right!'
Your body is bad and I heard you got a Caddy
When we make love you can call me daddy
I'm L.L. Cool J, say hey, Renee
I'm not a toyboy, but I still wanna play
Promise you I'm not wack when I'm in the sack
After that I leave you starvin for me to come back
But in the meantime, put your digits down
And the next time I see ya I'm goin to town""
Stepped away from the freak, it was a quarter to nine
When I rolled to the jam I saw the crew on line
Took a trip around the side, so I could get backstage
If you call me a tiger, then the stage is my cage
I rip, stomp and crush, heavy metal bands rust
Them flaky knuckleheads I crumble up like crust
Walked in my dressing room, and then I heard four knocks
They said, ""L.L., you're runnin late and it'is time to rock""
Told Cut Creator what the order would be
Then I said ""Lord have mercy"" and slapped hands with E
Went onstage, I heard the girlies scream
And that's the very moment I woke up from the dream
Aahh!

19,The Magnificent Jazzy Jeff,Rock The House,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,1987-12-18,323506,19,"

Some deejays are (good) some deejays are (fresh)
Some deejays are even (def)
But here's a little somethin 'bout my deejay
(The magnificient) Jazzy Jeff
So bust this beat

(Disc) (jock)

Yo Jazzy

[ VERSE 1: The Fresh Prince ]
Well, it's true that I'm the reigning king of the throne
But with all my strength, I couldn't do it alone
I need a deejay like (Jazzy) to back me up
So when I'm rockin on the mic he's on the crossfade cut
Scratchin and mixin, mixin and scratchin
Second after second it's the record
He's catchin
His hands are so fast that it's a medical riddle
With the turntable split and the mixer in the middle
Back and forth his hands fly
With the speed of a cheetah that'll puzzle your
Eye
Record after record, he has no mercy
Cuts left, cuts right, then he cuts vice versa
I'm not exaggerating, I said it and I meant it
I resent it if you say that his cuts are precedented
He's a lean, mean wreckin machine
He gets respected like a king when he's on the scene
So bust a move, cause you know he's def
He's my deejay (the magnificient) Jazzy Jeff

[ VERSE 2: The Fresh Prince ]
People often ask me everytime I emcee
Why do I brag so much about my disc jockey?
Well, the reason that I brag and I boast the most
Is cause my deejay is the most from coast to coast
(The magnificient) Jazzy Jeff, wack destroyer
Cuttin up records like a samurai warrior
If you deejays don't know who I'm talkin to
(I'm talkin to you) so (come on)
Cause in a battle you cannot win
Cause my deejay will (tear yo butt limb from limb!)
He's like a runaway tank, a hip-hop rebel
And if you wanna battle, you best bring a shovel
My man, so you can dig your grave
Cause there's no way that you could ever be saved
Because (the deejay cuts the record) to create the sound
(The deejay cuts the record) he's the best around
(The deejay cuts the record) you know he's down
His name is Jazzy Jeff a/k/a Jeff Townes
Commandin the cut he's always on track
He's DJ Jazzy Jeff and he's a cut maniac
So for your personal safety you should be told
That my DJ Jazzy Jeff is (out of control)

(Oh my God)
(Out of control)
(My goodness)

Alright Jazzy
We gon' do somethin a little different right now
This is what I want you to do for me
I want you to tell all these people your name
Jazzy, tell em your name

(He's Jazzy)
(His name is Jeff)

Yo Jazzy, I want you to tell all these people
How many of those deejays out there can get with you

(None)
(None of them)

How many?

(None of them)

Tell the truth

(None)
(None of them)
(None of them)

Now make the record burp

( *Jazzy Jeff produces burping sounds with the record* )

Say excuse me

( *Jazzy Jeff makes the scratch sound like an 'excuse me'* )

Now make it sound like a bird

( *Jazzy Jeff makes the record sound like a bird singing* )

Now make it chirp

( *the sound changes from singing to chirping *)

[ VERSE 3: The Fresh Prince ]
Now here's a story that should not be forgot
About the day my deejay turned into an autobot
He got struck by lightning in an electrical storm
He got on the wheels of steel and began to transform

( *Jazzy Jeff transforms* )

His name is Jeff, and he's as swift as a swiff
The type of guy that other deejays don't want to have to reckon with
He's by my side as I rock the mic
All of his vigorous cuts are sure to excite you
They'll delight you, you know that that's right, if you
Were a stick of dynamite, his cuts would ignite you
The deejay on the weels can't be matched
So (check out Jazzy Jeff with a cold cut scratch)

(Good)
(Jazzy)

(The magnificient)
(Jazzy Jeff)

( *JJ brings James Brown's 'Funky Drummer' into the mix)

(Ain't it funky)

I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)

[Verse 1]
My name is at the top of all of those that mix
Or turning poetry into cash for 87
Some did it got paid, some jams were never played
But I am just a poet who watched the whole parade
Go by, and why? Cos they wasn't fly
Others claim to be fresh, but they're not KRS
I cannot walk around the street with my head in the clouds
Either running on my gear or having colors too loud
Everything must coincide with the way I feel
And by the way it's Scott La Rock on the wheels of steel
So I take one step to adjust the mic
I get around the whole city so I do wear Nike
I like a funky beat, a studio like Unique
I write the crazy fresh lyrics and I don't eat meat
You can look me up and down and my DJ too
Because we make up the Boogie Down Productions crew
Taking out emcees on the 1, 2, 3
No matter who they claim to be in society
Because we know their games, we'll pull their file
If they need a different style we can get wild
He's I.C.U., he's out to kill
I'm KRS and we get ill
DJ Scott La Rock got his own beat
The extravagant life is what we seek
I will tell you like this cause I know for a fact
I will live a long life and I don't smoke crack
Captivating the crowd seven days a week
You know what they told me to say? I got the dope beat

[Hook]
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)

[Verse 2]
For me to say again another verse of my rhyme
Means what you heard before must've blew up your mind
So now it's time to find poetry like mine
Do not waste all your time because I'm one of a kind
Cooling out and easy going cause the money be flowing
6'4"", brown eyes, and I'm always showing
Stupid emcees on the mic the way it's 'posed to be done
They study rhymes all week but I be rhyming for fun
When they lose they get upset, always pulling a gun
But they must snap out of that because I'm KRS-One
Not two, not three, but O-N-E
Get it right the first time I won't repeat this rhyme
If you think that you can burn me with your amateur ways
Keep in mind that I been out there from back in the days
I don't brag about the people I know
Because they're still bluffing, they're not givin me nothing
I can walk around the city with the rhymes I flaunt
Cos no matter how you front it's still the ones you want
See, I am funky fresh and poetry is my opinion
Taking out you suckers while the Scott La Rock is spinning

[Hook]
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)

[Verse 3]
My name is KRS-One, I'm still kinda young
I don't wear Adidas cos my name ain't Run
Got Nikes on my feet and to be complete
I can rock an American or reggae beat
Got rhymes for the 70's, 80's, and 90's
Not being conceited but it won't pay to try me
Out to any feud, any battle, any reason
Make the rhymes up every season, this style, I'm just teasing
Pick up the pace, homeboy, pick up the pace
You're way behind schedule, listen to what I'm telling you
This particular style may vary
The things I converse about are heard rarely
Some can't bear me, others try to scare me
Sounding intelligent but not yet equivalent
You know what?

[Hook]
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)

I.C.U. is in the house
Miss Melodie is in the house
Lena Love is in the house
D-Nice rocks the house
Gold Miss Item rocks the house
Flavius Walker turns 'em out
42 Black knocks 'em out
To my mellow Moses Gun, rock the house

21,I Know You Got Soul,Paid In Full,Eric B. & Rakim,1987,284506,41,"

[Verse 1]
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating, you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
So you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance with the speaker till you hear it blow
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a four letter word when it's heard, it control
Your body to dance (You got it) soul
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, and let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck with
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up with
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def with the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can't dance, just clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

[Chorus]
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul

[Verse 2]
Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I wait cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

[Chorus]
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

[Verse 3]
I got soul (you got it) that's why I came
To teach those who can't say my name
First of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller
Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhymes while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R is requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
Cause almost anyone can relate to
Whoever's out of hand, I'ma give 'em handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let 'em melt?
Then give 'em a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold
Rakim is on the mic, and you know I got soul

[Chorus]
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

[Verse 4]
Now I'm a stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy cause the beat is fresh
Now if you're from Uptown, Brooklyn-bound
The Bronx, Queens, and Long Island Sound
Even other states come right and exact
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release
The rest is up to you, Rakim'll say peace

[Chorus]
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

22,Make It Funky,Rhyme Pays (Explicit Version),ICE-T,1987,310640,19,"

(Make it funky)
So the people can get down to the funky sound
'Cause my crew don't mess around
(Make it funky)
So the girls can get busy, dog the dance floor
Make the guys get dizzy
(Make it funky)
Totally def as Evil E cuts the records and the beat is kept
(Make it funky)

Stupid fly, it's got to be F-U-N-K-Y
So that you can get loose as I produce sounds hard as the deuce
Manipulate the bass gain give the level's a boost
The lyric layer rhyme sayer, born to be player
If politics were my kick then I'd be your mayor
Governator, Senator, I'm your mentor
Rap rhythm is erratic, time is four, four
I'm the microphone scholar, clockin' long dollars
Here to make the place funky while the fly girls holler
Genius vocalist, rhyme style priceless
Pound of gold around my neck, mic in my first
The microphone virtuoso crazy insane I'm loco
With the speed to exceed, make other MC's look slow-mo
Un-lease release words mean as a beast
I eat MC's for lunch and dinner, I can serve for a feast
Their rhymes are elementary, mine deserve a PH D
This beat is F-U-N-Key my name is Ice T

Make it funky

Undoubtedly you recognize this jam is the ultimate cut
Uncontrollably you motivate and move your butt
It's rough the beat is gangsterous, call it tough
If you're dissin' stop frontin', come on what's up?
Complicated voice gymnastics are all in your face
Vegas got my highs, E.V's got control my bass
My break is comin' get busy no time ta waste
Now's the time do bodywork here's the place

Make it funky

Make it funky enough so the tracks lay tough
'Cause I'm tossin' it up and the Ice don't bluff
The girl charmer toy Harmer, juice strong as armor
When I stand upon the stage you could call it melodrama
Intense suspense my voice immense
I wouldn't have you come and see me under false pretense
The girlies do be wildin' as I'm profilin'
Limos lined around the block for about a mile and a half
Autographs the list goes on
If you forgot it, ""make it funky"" is the name of this song
Stupid dope and you know it, it rates a ten
You pray my DJ cuts the records so it starts again
'Cause I can keep the mic cookin' for an entire month
My rhymes are always hard hittin' I don't know how to bunt
My DJ cuts like a laser E-V-I-L-E
Put your finger on the records
Make it, make it funky

Make it funky

24,Nightmares,Dana Dane with Fame,Dana Dane,1987-10-21,352546,27,"

[ Dane ]
Hello, I'd like to see Dr. Slumber, please
[ doctor's assistant ]
Ah - do you have an appointment, sir?
[ Dane ]
No, I don't
But tell the Doctor it's urgent that I see her
[ doctor's assistant ]
Well - just one moment
Dr. Slumber?
Dr. Slumber, there's a young man out here named -
Excuse me, what is your name?
[ Dane ]
Oh, tell her it's Dana Dane
[ doctor's assistant (hysterically) ]
Hhhh... D-D-Dana D-D-DANE?!
OH NO!
OH, YOU CAN COME RIGHT IN!
COME RIGHT IN, RIGHT NOW!
COME ON IN...!
[ Dane ]
Thank you, thank you

Well, I walked into the office, what did I see?
A well-shaped body with the back to me
Sittin in her chair with an all-white gown
Said said (Dana Dane, won't you please lay down?)
She said that she wouldn't reveal her face
Till my hour was up and I was on my way
Now we got to the matter of why I came there
I said, ""Doc, I keep havin these crazy nightmares""

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
'Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)

She said, ""Relax yourself, won't you tell me one
So I can diagnose and see what must be done""
I laid back my head, start to inhale
Caught my breath, and then I said, ""Well -
Bright one morning I was late for class
Had a fresh pair of frames with Gucci on the glass
Girls they was hawking, dudes they was talkin'
Saw the doggy-dogg female, I kept on walkin'
She was on it hard, there was no denyin'
Shoulda seen what this female was tryin'
Grabbin on my shirt, tuggin' on my slacks
Pullin' on my zipper board, I had to hold her back
Word up, Doc, on the ultimate
Now if I never saw a creature, this girl was it
I kept on walkin', had to leave this place
But she was all up on me, breathin' in my face
You may think I'm lyin though it's just a dream
This girl had the baddest breath I'd ever seen
I couldn't think straight, thought I was doomed
Heard a bling-bling-bling, it was time for homeroom
I stepped real quick, she tried to play it sassy
She almost ran me down, this nasty fatnastee
Dipped to the stairs, running blind
Get to my homeroom, ran through my mind
Got to the 4th floor, standin in the door
Girlies watchin' me walk down the corridor
The guys they were jealous and gettin mad
And all the girlies wishin' they had the class I had
Got to my classroom, expect to see the teacher
Who did I see? That ugly black creature
Paused for a minute standin' in the door
Then I broke out when the girlie went raw
Word em up, Doc, couldn't stand the smell
Heard of 3D? Well, she was fat as hell
I ran out the school, I didn't look back
I tell you, Dr. Slumber, this girl was wack
And that's about the time when I awoke
And I smelled that awful breath that almost made me choke
Now tell me, Dr. Slumber, how can it be?
That this dream somehow became reality?
I can't go to sleep, cause I'm so damn scared
'Cause I keep havin these crazy nightmares""

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
'Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)
(Nightmares)

She said, ""Listen, Dana Dane, I think I have the cure
But I have to hear one more before I'll be sure""
I laid back my head, tried to concentrate
Then I told her the nightmare 'bout the blind date
Had a blind date with this girl named Anita
The Fever's the place I'm supposed to meet her
Saw the def body with the vicious butt
How did I know she was a marvelous mutt
This lady I met was as ugly as hell
Couldn't go in the jam with this female
I was coughin hard, she started to braggin'
Couldn't let them know I was here with this dragon
Grabbed her hand, dipped to Harlem World
But I left this ugly lady for another girl
Now this other female, her name was Denise
Couldn't get no rapture, there followed the beast
Everywhere I turn, everywhere I look
There was Anita the beast, she could not be shook
I dipped, I dived, I ran, I thrived
But there was no place that I could hide
'Cause she was sniffin me out like a hungry blood hound
Her tail in the air, her nose to the ground
Only thing left for me to do
Was to set her up with this other dude
Now this other dude, he was real upset
'Cause this ugly female he didn't wanna check
He started actin wild, even called me a faggot
What could I do, he had a .22 automatic
I dipped into the crowd, made my way to the door
Bumped into this object and I hit the floor
When I looked up, what did I see?
I saw Anita the Beast lookin down at me
I couldn't try to play it, couldn't try to pretend
Like the ASPCA I had to take the dog in

Nightmares of the night (nightmares)
Nightmares, they're alright (nightmares)
Cause they just show imagination of reality (nightmares)
Just keep telling yourself that they're make-believe (nightmares)
(Nightmares)

Now I pleaded, ""Dr. Slumber, I just can't bear
To have another one of these crazy nightmares""
Then all of a sudden she turned around
And starin at me with that all-white gown
With a Catholic smile, showin all her teeth
Was that ugly female, Anita the Beast...

[ Dr. Slumber, her sweet, soft voice turning horrifying ]
Dana?
Dana, honey, wake up!
What's wrong?
Wake up, honey
You are just... HAVING A NIGHTMARE!
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

25,Going Way Back,Kool & Deadly (Justicisms),Just-Ice,1987,303933,24,"

[Intro: Just Ice and KRS One]
To the best of my knowledge I guess that I'm fresh
And when I manifest I never protest
(Hold it, hold it. What's going on, Just?)
Yo KRS, what's the, what's the, what's the purpose of you stopping me?
(Yo man kick the rhymes you was just kicking to me a while ago)
Aight

[Verse 1: Just Ice]
I'll wax and maim, rappers who proclaim
To be the epitome of this game
Fronting like you hard, rugged and rough
Soft like butter, creamy like a puff
On the mic no sense, head very dense
Just listen to the gangster and I will convince
All that doubt my power of speech
The title of the gangster they tried to impeach
But um, it is protected by the black and the red
It's not true all gangsters are dead
Not a gangster with a gun, doing crime none of that
Kill a MC with the rhyme cause I'm the gangster of rap
In fact, exact, I'm the dominant black
Coming full force on, and power that's packed
For all the party people this is a fact
For all the pioneers I'm going way back

[Bridge: KRS One]
Goddamn, that is funky funky funky fresh (Dope! Dope!)
If you could just keep kicking that, we'll be alright til '88
Dig it (Dope! Dope!)

[Verse 2: Just Ice]
Going way way back to the early days
Of 75 and the Black Spades
Chilling with my homeboy Muscle Man Ron
In the Boogie Down Bronx BKA Pelan
It was a privilege for people to see
Bambaataa rocking hard at 123
On a Friday night the boys would come running
To hear big beats that were shocking and stunning
In the Hill, not a thing was chill
Sound Masters on the loose and acting ill
Up top, every weekend rock
Either 131 or around that block
But anywhere Uptown, you always heard the sound
Hip Hop, funky beats, MCs getting down
The truth I swear, admit and declare
The Bronx was the first, I know, I was there
The beats were dope, the sound was on
By the way saying Peace to my brother Melquan
Dedications have a little bit more
The L Brothers, Grand Wizard Theodore
I can't forget where we used to ill
With the young Sound Masters in Castle Hill
I can keep going on, for more and more
With Breakout, and Baron, and the Funky 4
On the other side of town, the mics in their hands
The lecherous, treacherous also perpetuous MCs cold in command
And if you listen to that for an actual fact
For all the pioneers I'm going way back

[Bridge: KRS One]
Word! Now you know I know
This is KRS with Just Ice (Dope! Dope!)
Ha ha. Talk about dope beats (Dope!)
Yo Just, kick me one more verse, please!

[Verse 3: Just Ice]
Let's rest, so I can take a breath
Cause I'm bearing the truth and nothing less
No disrepect intended but I have to show ya
If I didn't say your name that means I did not know ya
To get to the point, to make it clear
If I don't say your name that means you was not there
It's true, I'm from the old school
I'm the professor and they are my pupils
I teach and never preach
Not a bloodsucker, parasite or a leech
I'm telling you how, it was or is
The Bronx is the home for the Hip Hop kids
A long time ago when I was raising hell
With the nappy head of hair at the age of 12
I saw and heard, crews that rocked
The Cold Crushers, Monsters, Breakout, Sasquatch
You're not familiar with the funky sound
That proves it right there, you wasn't down
Had to earn a position, and do hard work
You can ask Kool Herc or my man Red Alert
He'll tell ya, because he knows for sure
About Flash, EZ Mike, and the Furious Four
I'll run off some names, with no offence
Listen up real close, as I commence
Coke La Rock, Clark Kent, my man Cool Fish
Homeboy Tre Dee and Frisky Frisk
Wonderful sincere, in the atmosphere
Almighty Kay Gee at Union Square
Dr. Kik rock on, and my man Shelt La Rocker
B.I., KRS, C Rasta
Definitely we would rock
And I can't forget my homeboy Big Knot
It's the truth and for an actual fact
For all the pioneers I'm going way back

[Outro: KRS One and Just Ice]
Well I think that's about as far back as we can go
(Saying peace to my man T La Rock!)
Word! Saying peace to my brother Scott La Rock, he's in here!
(Scott La Rock rock on!)
Word
(DMX peace!)
Peace!
(Peace!)

26,Move The Crowd,Paid In Full,Eric B. & Rakim,1987,227306,18,"

[Verse 1]
Standing by the speaker, suddenly I had this
Fever, was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind starts to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause when I heard the beat I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It's simple ain't it, but quite clever
Some of you've been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritating my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause, if not, and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long 'cause I'ma move on
The dancefloor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd

[Verse 2]
Imagine me with the heat that's made by solar
It gets stronger every time I hold a
Microphone, check the tone to get started
The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving but eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth is shut
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric B is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent, wise on the mic I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'mma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praises due to Allah and that's a blessing
With knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees I revolve
This is actual fact, it's not an act, it's been proven
Indeed and I proceed to make the crowd keep moving

Yo Chuck, run a power move on 'em
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
Yeah, step back, get away, give the brother some room
You got to all turn me up when the beat goes boom
Lyric to lyric, line to line
And then you y'all understand my reputation for rhyme
Cause my rhyme reputation depends on what?
Style of record my DJ cuts
His slice and dice, super mix so nice
So bad, you won't dispute the price
Cause it's plain to see, it's a strain to be
Number one in the public eye enemy
Cause I'm wanted in fifty, almost in fifty-one
States where the posse got me on the run
It's a big wonder why I haven't gone under
Dodgin' all types of microphone thunder
A fugitive missin' all types of hell
All this because I talk so well

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
The match up title, the expression of thrill
For elite to compete and attempt to get ill
If looks could kill, I'd chill until
All the public catches on to my material, you know
The ducks criticize my every phase of rapture
Can't wait to read the headlines of my capture
Accused of assault, a first degree crime
Cause I beat competitors with my rhyme
Tongue whipped, pushed, shoved and tripped
Choked from the hold of my kung fu grip
And if you want my title, it would be suicidal
From my end, it would be homicidal
When I do work, you get destroyed
All the paranoid, know to avoid
The Public Enemy seat I've enjoyed
This is no kid and I'm not no toy boy

I'm a Public Enemy, but I don't rob banks
I don't shoot bullets and I don't shoot blanks
My style is supreme, number one is my rank
And I got more power than the New York Yanks
If my Uzi wasn't heavy, I would probably fire it
Make you walk the plank if I was a pirate
If they made me a king, I would be a tyrant
If you want to get me, go ahead and try it
Snatcher, dispatcher, biter never been a
Instead of takin' me out, take a girl to dinner
The level of comp has never been thinner
It's a runaway race where I'm the winner
It's unreal, they call the law
And claimed I had started a war
It was war they wanted and war they got
But they wilted in the heat when my Uzi got hot

My style versatile said without rhymes
Which is why they're after me and on my back
Lookin' over my shoulder,  seein' what I write
Hearin' what I say, then wonderin' why
Why they can't ever compete on my level
Superstar status is my domain
Understand my rhythm, my pattern of lecture
And then you'll know why I'm on the run
This change of events results in a switch
It's the lateral movement of my vocal pitch
It eliminates pressure on the haunted
But the posse is around so I got to front it
Plus employ tactics so coy
And leave no choice but to destroy
Soloists, groups and what they say
And all that try to cross my way
When I

There's a brand new dance and it's coming your way
It was started in Miami by the Ghetto DJs
Say some call it nasty but that's not true
It's just the only dance that you can do
'Cause you need a sexy body, make your partner come alive
If you can't do that, don't even try
So get yourself together and learn it quick
Just get on the floor and (throw that D)

When I went to Miami couldn't believe my eyes
This female was throwing, wanted me to try
If you don't know how to do it here's what you must do
Just listen up close, I'll explain to you
Just jump, in the air
And when you land you wind like you just don't care
It's all in the hips, so go berserk
And let that...do the work
So while it's working you better start stroking
To show your partner that you ain't joking
'Cause this ain't a dance from Mother Goose
Better freak yo body and turn it loose
Cause when you're on the floor you don't give a sh...

[Verse 1]
Riding one day on my freestyle fix
Jamming to a tape Scott La Rock had mixed
I said to myself ""This tape sound funky""
Riding past a 116th Street junkie
Thought I saw Denise but I was only assuming
Took another look and that butt was booming
Did a little trick on my freestyle fix
And I was right beside the girl, she was all on the tip
She said ""Hi, DJ KRS""
She kissed me on my neck so I gave her a peck
She said ""I'm really in a hurry so I cannot wait
If you give me a lift, while we ride we'll debate""
She jumped on my bike, I said ""Huh, what's your stop?""
She said ""Right around the corner to the crack spot
If you buy me a crack I'll know how to act
But if you don't, you might as well step back""
I said ""Now how the hell we jump off to this?
I'm doing you a favor, I'm giving you a lift""
She said ""KRS, you know how it go""
I said ""Yeah, you little... it seems that you're a ho""
I did a little trick on my freestyle fix
And she was right on the ground looking after it
Because...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
A girl tried to take me out one day
For a play, not your everyday trey
We walked to the spot, she says she want a rock
I looked in my pocket, didn't have a lot
I said... ""You better get yourself a job""
She tried to tell me that times were hard
I told the ho, I said ""Yo, that's not my fault
You need a vault"", I'm out to assault
Any girl I find who try to take me for mine
I'm gonna have to finish this another time
But...

[Intro: Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy-E]
Hey, yo, remember that shit Eazy did a while back?
Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
That crazy shit?
Yeah, the stupid shit, man
That shit was dope
Hey yo, Eazy!
Wassup?
Hey man, why don't you come off the piano for a minute and bust this crazy shit?

[Verse 1]
Woke up quick at about noon
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon
I gotta get drunk before the day begins
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends
About to go and damn near went blind
Young niggas at the pad, throwin' up gang signs
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip
With the MAC-10 on the side of my hip
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'
Jumped in the fo', hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back and side to side
Then I let the Alpine play
Bumpin' new shit by N.W.A
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list
Then I played my old shit, it went somethin' like this
Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there, cold-shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin', Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
""It's all about makin' that GTA""

[Hook]
'Cause the boys n' the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Yo, man!
Get the fuck out!
Pump that beat!
Mothafucka, say what?

[Verse 2]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man J.D. is on freebase
The boy J.D. was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car, tryin' to steal my Alpine
Chase him up the street to call a truce
The silly motherfucker pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12-gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

[Hook]
'Cause the boys n' the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Yo, Leroy!
Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue

[Verse 3]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'
Left to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross and knocked his old ass out

[Hook]
'Cause the boys n' the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Who do you think you are, Mr. Big Stuff?
Rock mothafucka, like the hard three the hard way

[Verse 4]
I'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control
Then wrapped the six-fo' round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh, brother
I'll throw it in the gutter and go buy another.""
Walkin' home and I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin' Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beaten for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

[Hook]
'Cause the boys n' the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

L.A. playa
Big Drum beater

[Verse 5]
I went to get them out, but there was no bail
The fellas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
""Disruption of the court,"" said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""Fire!"", then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder

[Hook]
'Cause the boys n' the hood are always hard
You come talkin' that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Yeah, I kicked a little ass
But that was a blast from the past, mothafucka
Get busy, y'all y'all y'all y'all!

31,Children's Story,The Great Adventures Of Slick Rick (Deluxe Edition),Slick Rick,1988-11-01,242040,58,"

[Produced by Slick Rick]

(Now here's a little something that needs to be heard)

[Intro]
Uncle Ricky, could you read us a bedtime story?
Please, huh, please?
All right, you kids get to bed, I'll get the storybook
Y'all tucked in? Yeah
Here we go

[Verse]
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought to: good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said:
""Me and you, tonight we're gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said ""Keep still, boy, no need for static""
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the little boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said ""Why'd you hit me?""
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister
Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good and from expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him (Sorry!)
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw? (who?)
Dave, the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said ""I need bullets, hurry up, run!""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car ‒ a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead
He told the cops ""Back off or honey here's dead""
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
And before long the little boy got surrounded
He dropped his gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
Straight and narrow or yo' soul gets cast
Good night

[Outro]
(Knock him out the box, Rick
Knock him out, Rick)
- Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky is really weird
- I know right what does he mean
“Straight and narrow or yo’ soul gets cast""?
- I don’t know, I think he be crackin' it up or something
- Well, good night
- Good night

Another (that's right!) Rick the Ruler presentation
Crumbs!

32,Ain't No Half-Steppin',Long Live The Kane,Big Daddy Kane,1988-01-01,319906,50,"

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Aw yeah, I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics 'cause '88
Time to set it straight, know what I'm sayin'?
And ain't no half-steppin'
Word, I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Rappers steppin' to me, they want to get some
But I'm the Kane, so, yo, you know the outcome
Another victory, they can't get with me
So pick a B.C. date 'cause you are history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And steppin' to me—yo, that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs—dope or dog food?
Competition, I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
'Cause when it comes to bein' dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
'Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you try to be basin'
Friday the 13th, I'ma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes, Big, not little
So define it, here's your walkin' papers, sign it
And take a walk as the Kane start to talk, 'cause ...

[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
""Down the road""

[Verse 2]
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin'
To sound like me, so soon I'll have to open
A school of emceein', for those who wanna be in
My field and court, then again, on second thought
To have MCs coming out sounding so similar
It's quite confusing for you to remember the
Originator and boy, do I hate a
Perpetrator but I'm much greater
The best, oh, yes, I guess suggest the rest
Should fess, don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraphs I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove until when it's
The climax and IMAX, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next - the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, hah shit!
I stop and stand strong over MCs
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
'Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth and if you try to riff
Or get with the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes 'til I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son 'cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're tryna go
When you wanna step to me, I think you should know that

[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
""Down the road""

[Verse 3]
I appear right here and scare and dare a mere
Musketeer that would dare to compare, put him in the rear
Back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to the wannabe competition
Trying to step to me, must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'ma get you at
You think I'm losin'? Pfft, picture that

[Hook]
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Mister Cee, step to me

[Verse 4]
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make MCs evaporate
The party people say, 'Damn, that rapper's great'
The creator, conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy bein' me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other MCs that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo I'ma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slow down
Just give yourself a break or someone else will take your title
Namely me because I'm homicidal
That means murder, yes I'm out to hurt a-
-nother MC that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him and take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign, As Salaam Alaikum!

33,You Gots To Chill,Strictly Business,EPMD,1988-06-07,261839,51,"

[Intro: Parrish Smith + sample]
You gots to chill
DJ K La Boss cuts ""Jungle boogie""

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
Relax your mind, let your conscience be free
And get down to the sounds of EPMD
Well you should keep quiet while the MC rap
But if you tired, then go take a nap!
Or stay awake and watch the show I take
Because right now - I'm 'bout to shake and bake
The E-R-I-C-K is my name, I spell
Thanks to the clientele, yo I rock well
I'm not an MC who talkin' all that junk
About who can beat who, soundin' like a punk
I just get down and I go for mine
Say ""check one-two"" and run down the line

[Verse 2: Parrish Smith]
To the average MC I'm known as The Terminator
Funky beat maker, new jack exterminator
Destroying a ploy, when your rhymes are not void
Never sweatin' your girl (Why P?) 'Cause she's a skeezoid
When I'm on the scene I always rock the spot
I grab the steel with the crown on top
In the beginnin', I like to let my rhymes flow
And at twelve I press cruise control
Sit back and relax, let my rhymes tax
Maintain MC's while the Double E macks
Always calm under pressure, no need to act ill
Listen when I tell you boy

[Chorus: Parrish Smith]
You gots to chill
DJ K La Boss cuts ""Jungle boogie""

[Verse 3: Erick Sermon]
I be the personal computer information on rap
Like the B-I-Z Markie says, I'll make your toes tap
I format the rhymes, step by step
Make em sound def to maintain my rep
Prepared to come off, in case of a diss
Not worried about a thing, 'cause we can do this
I can turn the party out just by standin' still
Make the ladies scream and shout while the brothers act ill
Take total control of your body and soul
Pack a nine in my pants for when it's time to roll

[Verse 4: Parrish Smith]
I'm the P double-E M-D-E-E
And one thing I hate, is a bitin' MC
When I enter the party suckers always form a line
Then they ease their way up, and try to bite my lines
I did thousands of shows, dissed many faces
And deal with new jacks on a one-to-one basis
But every now and then a sucker MC gets courageous
And like an epidemic it becomes contagious
But never the least they all R.I.P
For all those unaware it means Rest In Peace
'Cause M.D. -- stands for Microphone Doctor
And the capital P (capital P) capital M (capital M)
Capital D-E-E's no doubt the chief rocker
Don't like to get ill, but if I have to I kill
So believe me boy

[Chorus: Parrish Smith]
You gots to chill
DJ K La Boss cuts ""Jungle boogie!""

[Verse 5: Erick Sermon]
Catch every word I'm sayin', no there's no delayin'
Don't hesitate to motivate the crowd I'm not playin'
Seein' is believin', you catch my drift?
Don't try to adapt because I'm just too swift
(How swift?) I'm so swift and that's an actual fact
I'm like Zorro, I mark a E on your back
I don't swing on no ropes or no iron cords
The only weapon is my rappin' sword

[Verse 6: Parrish Smith]
Intimidate MCs with the tone of my vocal throne
When I'm pushin' on the microphone
'Cause I'm the funky rhyme maker, MC undertaker
The one who likes to max and relax
And when it's time, issue dig-em-smacks
I keep their hands clappin', fingers snappin', feet tappin'
When it's time to roll Uzi patrol is packin'
The PMD, the mic's my only friend
And through the course of the party, I kill again and again
So if you're thinkin' bout battlin' you better come prepared
Come with your shield and your armor geared

[Chorus: All]
You gots to chill
DJ K La Boss cuts ""Jungle boogie!""

[Outro: Erick Sermon, Parrish Smith]
DJ La Boss,  takes no shorts

Had a fly girl Flo, called her honey
Next thing she spent up all my money
Had me in debt, you and your girl’s dizzy
Stopped movin’ crack, but you’re still gettin’ pissy
You could call me everyday God sent
Like you was Lois Lane and I was Clark Kent
I spend and I spend and you spent and you spent
Now my house with a mouse is a roach with a tent

Mary-Mary-Mary, you cold thumb suckin’
Lookin’ for you, but you keep duckin’
I wanna find you, I gotta tell you somethin’
So just be quiet and don’t say (Nuttin’)
Mary-Mary-Mary, why you out there stuntin’?
Supposed to be with me, but not you’re frontin’
We started out new, you used to be true
Now you’re buggin’, what’s wrong with you?

[Bridge: The Monkees sample & Run-D.M.C.]
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

[Verse 3: Run, (D.M.C.)]
Now! This girl Mary I knew so well
I met her on the road in a fly hotel
High on the heels and never failed
(Clubs and the pubs is where she dwelled)
Story about Mary was well to tell
She seemed to scheme for a dream to sell
She spent a night locked in a cell
I knew Mary well cause she “Raising Hell”

[Bridge: The Monkees sample & Run-D.M.C.]
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

[Verse 4: D.M.C.]
It’s not Mary who was quite contrary
Talkin’ bout Mary who was always in a hurry
The things she needed were necessary
She did not need, a busted cherry
True and blue just like a blueberry
Ask if she’s crazy and I’ll say very
Livin’ in a house that’s out on the prairie
I worry about Mary, cause Mary is scary

[Outro: The Monkees sample & Run-D.M.C.]
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?

35,Microphone Fiend,Follow The Leader,Eric B. & Rakim,1988,314600,47,"

[Verse: Rakim]
I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphones instead of cones of ice cream
Music-orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
'Cause I grabbed the mic and try to say, ""yes, y'all""
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab, without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the other one, then I make another one
To diss the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, 'cause it's sort of an addiction
Magnetized by the mixing
Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in
The mic is a Drano, volcanoes erupting
Rhymes overflowing, gradually growing
Everything is written in a code, so it can coincide
My thought's a guide
48 tracks to slide
The invincible microphone fiend Rakim
Spread the word, 'cause I'm in E-F-F-E-C-T
A smooth operator operating correctly
But back to the problem, I got a habit
You can't solve it, silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
Unawareness? Beware, it's the re-animator
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiending for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend
After 12, I'm worse than a Gremlin
Feed me hip-hop and I start trembling
The thrill of suspense is intense, you're horrified
But this ain't the cinemas or Tales from the Darkside
By any means necessary, this is what has to be done
Make way 'cause here I come
My DJ cuts material
Grand imperial
It's a must that I bust any mic you hand to me
It's inherited—it runs in the family
I wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back
If that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack
Now I don't want to have to let off, you should have kept off
You didn't keep the stage warm, step off
Ladies and gentleman, you're about to see
A pastime, hobby about to be
Taken to the maximum, I can't relax see
I'm hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of an antidote, something you can't smoke, more than dope
You're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should have backed up
For those that act up need to be more than smacked up
Any entertainer, I got a torture chamber
One on one and I'm the remainder
So close your eyes and hold your breath
And I'mma hit ya with the blow of death
Before you go, you'll remember ya seen
The fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend
The microphone fiend

I shot the sheriff

(""Don't get too close because you might get shot"")

I shot the sheriff

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
Try to answer to the master or the MC rap God is no joke
On the lyric - it's hard to be modest
I knew I was the man with the master plan
To make you wiggle and jiggle, like gelatin
Just think while I sink, into the brain structure
(Don't sleep on the E) You see, somethin' might rupture
It don't take time for me to blow your mind
Take a second to wreck it because you're dumb and blind
So just lounge.. cause you're a MC clown
Go join the circus.. EPMD's in town

[Parrish Smith]
Total chaos -- no mass confusion
Rhymes so hypnotizin' known to cause an illusion
Like a magician.. who pulls a rabbit out a hat, son
I pull them all like a .44 Magnum
MC freeze stop look and listen, and try to imagine
It's travellin' the speed of light, but everything's motion
Is frightening.. plus the thought you alone
You now enter dimension, called the Twilight Zone
You're terrified.. plus you can't bear the thought
You and I one-on-one, in the Land of the Lost
You start to shiver.. but then you scream, my friend
Yo, wake up Muttley, because you're dreamin' again
But next time I'm on the scene, do not try to diss us
Keep your mouth shut sucker duck, because I'm Strictly Business

[Hook]
I shot the sheriff

[Erick Sermon]
This is the rap season.. where the E starts pleasin'
Girls around the world no need to be skeezin'
When I roll I stroll, cool always pack a tool
Just in case.. a brother acts a fool
I've got the energy, to put the girls in the frenzy
Put it in shock when I rock, give it up I'm not stingy
Make sure I don't bore when I'm on the dance floor..
(Get busy, boy) Like you never saw before
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
Rhyme flow.. good to go.. after the show.. I'll pull your ho, boy
(Yo, you sniff blow?) .. Hell no!
I got my whole life ahead of me, no time to be sniffin'
And my parents find out, then they start riffin'
So I stay, a-okay, cause I'm the E.. the R-I-C-K

[Parrish Smith]
MC's look me in my face, then their eyes get weak
Pulse rate descends.. heart rate increases
It's like beam me up, Scotty, I control your body
I'm as deadly as AIDS when it's time to rock a party
And all due respect, when I say mic check
Let a sucker slide once -- then I break his neck
So when I say jump, you reply, ""How high?""
Because I'm takin' no prisoners, so don't play hero and die
You're just a soldier.. and I'm a Green Beret
I do not think twice about the MC's I slay
So if you want to battle, I highly recommend this:
Bring your dog, mom, and dad.. because I'm Strictly Business

[Hook]
I shot the sheriff

Yo yo, you're still pickin' on that four-leaf clover?
Bring in the Sandman, sucker.. because it's over
My name is Erick Sermon and I'm back again
I see the heads still turnin' and my so-called friends
They smile in my face -- behind my back they talk trash
Mad and stuff -- because they don't have cash
Like the E-Double.. or the PMD
He drives a Corvette, I drive a Samurai Suzuki
I'm a locksmith.. with the key to fame
Never high on myself -- always stay the same
Play a lot because I'm hot, like a horse I trot
Around the track and back -- fatigued? No, I'm not

[Parrish Smith]
Well I'm the mellow, the fellow, the one who likes to say hello
To a fly girl that is good to go
With the slow tempo, and the off-beat rhyme flow
Cause when I am in action, there is no time for maxin'
Or relaxin' -- just reactin' and subtractin'
On a sucker MC who mouth keeps on yappin' and flappin'
I lose my cool, then I'll start slappin' and smackin'
You wanna roll? Then Albee start jackin' and cappin'
No time to lounge, I'm packin' and strappin'
At my point of attack I soar at you like an eagle
I'm the sheriff, and bitin' is illegal
So next time in town, I highly recommend this
You gots to chill, because I'm Strictly Business

37,Vapors,Just a Friend - EP,Biz Markie,2009-06-11,362293,44,"

[Intro]
Radio, TV, and even the press
Know the meanin of V-A-P-O-R-S
The meanin' of this word without no doubt
Means nobody wants to be there when you’re down and out
Once you’re established and got a lot of money
Everybody wanna be your buddy and honey
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers

[Verse 1]
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how this spreaded throughout my crew
Well you all know TJ Swan who sang on my records
""Make the Music"", ""Nobody Beats the Biz"", well, check it
Back in the days before this began
He used to try to talk to this girl name Fran
The type of female with fly Gucci wear
With big truck jewelry and extensions in her hair
When Swan tried to kick it, she always fessed
Talking about ""Nigga please, you work for UPS""
Since he wasn't no type of big drug dealer
My man TJ Swan didn't appeal to her
But now he trucks gold and wear fly Bally boots
Rough leather fashion and tough silk suits
Now she stop fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming to all the shows every single weekend
To get his beeper number, she'd be begging please
Dying for the day to get skeezed

[Hook]
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

[Verse 2]
I got another partner that's calm and plain
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
Back in the days he was nothing like that
I remember when he used to fight every day
What grown-ups would tell him he would never obey
He wore his pants hanging down and his sneakers untied
And a rasta-type Kangol tilted to the side
Around his neighborhood people treated him bad
And said he was the worst thing his moms ever had
They said that he will grow up to be nothing but a hoodlum
Or either in jail, or someone would shoot him
But now he's grown up, to their surprise
Big Daddy got a hit record selling worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Be saying can I borrow a dollar, ooh, you're a star now

[Hook]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 3]
Now I got a cousin by the name of Vaughan Lee
Better known to y'all as Cutmaster Cool V
He cuts, scratch, transform with finesse
{imitates cuts and scratches} and all that mess
Well I remember when he first started to rock
And tried to get this job in a record shop
He was in it to win it but the boss fronted
Said, ""Sorry Mr. Lee, but there's no help wanted""
Now my cuz Vaughan still tried on and on and on
'Til the like break of dawn
To put this j-o-b in effect
But they'd look right past him and be like, ""Next""
Now for the year of '88
Cool V is making dollars so my cousin's like straight
He walks into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like, ""Vaughan, welcome to my store""
Offering him a job but naw, he don't want it
Damn, it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught from my cousin
The vapors

[Hook]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 4]
Last subject of the story is about Biz Mark
I had to work for mine to put your body in park
When I was a teenager, I wanted to be down
With a lot of MC-DJ'ing crews in town
So in school on Nobel Street, I say ""Can I be down, champ""
They said no and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected I was very depressed
Sat and wrote some def doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to come to parties they'd make me pay
I would have to beg to get on the mic and rap that day
I was never into girls, I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep it instead of trying to use it
But now things switched, without belief
""Yo, Biz, do you remember me from Noble Street, chief?
We used to be down back in the days""
It happens all the time and never cease to amaze

[Hook]
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

Guess who's back
Guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Chorus]
Hey young world... the world is yours
Hey young world... the world is yours
Young world young world... the world is yours
Young world

[Verse 1]
This rap here... it may cause concern it's
Broad and deep... why don't you listen and learn
Love, peace, happiness... that once was strong
But due to society... even that's turned wrong
Times have changed... ay it's cool to look bummy
And be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
Have you forgotten... who put you on this Earth?
Who brought you up right... and who loved you since your birth?
Reward is a brainwashed kid going wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company... hey, now you've been framed
Your parents are hurting... hurting and ashamed
You're ruining yourself... and your mommy can't cope
Hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
Here's a rule for the non fool.. your life don't drool
Don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
Get ahead... and accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves 'cause... hey, they don't admire you
Their time's limited, hardrocks' too
So listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
Go for yours, 'cause dreams come true
And you'll make your mommy proud... so proud of you too
And this is a message... that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

[Refrain]
You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party
You know, you know what, you know what?
We like to party (Hey young world, the world is yours)
(Hey young world)
You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party

""Yo peep this""

[Verse 2]
Hey Mr. Bigshot... hey, don't you look fly?
But you don't have a dollar... ohhhh, my my my
You've been fightin again and, you forgot why
Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
Why? Because you make your family cry
And all jokes aside, are you in good health?
Hey little boy... now have you really checked yourself?
You're a disgust, you know someone that I can't trust, you'd
Steal mom's welfare... and you'd run and buy some dust, and
Plus, I must say... big shot, you're not
Your friends are talking and I'm hearing that your girls are what?
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
And while you're at it... go get a suit for a job
You see you're actin like this urge is demanding
C'mon, wake up... have some understanding
Society's a weak excuse for a man
It's time for the brothers... it's time trying to take the stand
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you, he
Guides you... and he watched you as you grew, plus
Past the age of... a little child, that's true
But folks your age don't act like you do, so
So be mature... and put the point to a halt
And if you're over eighteen... I wish you'd act like an adult
Don't live in a world... of hate, hate, hate
Pull yourself together... and get yourself straight
Men don't steal... hey, most don't borrow
And if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
So be more mature... and kids do your chores
Make your own money... hey, be proud that's yours
You know why, 'cause that's a man... that's brains, no spite
Stayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight
And a man never loses a fight... in God's sight
'Cause righteous laws are overdue
And this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

[Refrain]
You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party
You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party

39,Follow The Leader,Follow The Leader,Eric B. & Rakim,1988-01-01,336866,41,"

[Verse 1]
Follow me into a solo, get in the flow
And you can picture like a photo
Music mix, mellow maintains to make
Melodies for emcees, motivates the breaks
I'm everlasting, I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as x-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard
Flip it—now it's a daily word
I can get iller than 'Nam, I kill and bomb
But no alarm—Rakim'll remain calm
Self-esteem makes me super, superb and supreme
But for a microphone, still I fiend
This was a tape, I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I want to see you keep following and swallowing
Taking and making, biting and borrowing
Brothers tried and others died to get the formula
But I'mma let you sweat, you still ain't warm, you a
Step away from frozen, stiff as if you're posing
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me and while you're thinking you were first
Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the universe
What could you say as the Earth gets further and further away
Planets as small as balls of clay
Astray into the Milky Way, worlds out of sight
Far as the eye can see not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As you stare in the darkness, your knowledge is took
So keep staring, soon you suddenly see a star
You better follow it, 'cause it's the R
This is a lesson if you're guessing and if you're borrowing
Hurry hurry step right up and keep following the leader

[Verse 2]
This is a lifetime mission, vision a prison
Aight, listen
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep you moving 'cause the crowd said so
Dance! Cuts rip your pants
Eric B. on the blades bleeding to death, call the ambulance
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone, murdering emcees
Let's quote, a rhyme from a record I wrote
(Follow the leader) Yeah, dope
'Cause every time I stop it seems you're stuck
As soon as you try to step off you self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showing and proving and letting knowledge be born
Then after that I live forever. You disagree?
You say never? Then follow me
From century to century, you'll remember me
In history, not a mystery or a memory
God by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave
But remember - you're not a slave
'Cause we was put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, rebuild my name
I guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted, it can't be changed or switched
Here's a lesson if you're guessing and borrowing
Hurry, hurry step right up and keep following the leader

[Chorus: Samples]
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""
Rakim'll say, ""Follow the leader""

[Verse 3]
A furified freestyle—lyrics of fury
My third eye make me shine like jewelry
You're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-maid
I'll be here when it fade, I'll watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every traitor or snake, so stay awake
And follow and follow because the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
I'm not him, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt, 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed, slow down and let the leader lead
Word to daddy...indeed
The R's a rolling stone, so I'm rolling
Directions is told then the rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin' a brother said dig him, I never dug him
He couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug him
Into danger zone he should arrange his own
Face it, it's basic, erase it change your tone
There's one R in the alphabet
It's a one letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B. be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state, followers tailgate
Keep coming but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up, regroup, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant, clap your hands, you won a trip
The price is right don't make a deal too soon
How many notes, can you name this tune?
Follow the leader is a title/theme/task
Now you know, you don't have to ask
Rap is Rhythm and Poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might catch up if you follow the records E wrecks
Until then keep eating and swallowing
You better take a deep breath and keep following the leader

[Outro]
Rakim
The R
Rakim'll say peace
Follow the leader
Follow the leader

40,My Philosophy,By All Means Necessary (Expanded Edition),Boogie Down Productions,1988-05-31,340133,43,"

[Intro]
(""So, you're a philosopher?"")
(""Yes, I think very deeply."")
In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Let us begin, what, where, why or when
Will all be explained like instructions to a game
See I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking you, ""Who is more dramatical?""
This one or that one, the white one or the black one
Pick the punk and I'll jump up to attack one
KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew
Right up to your face and diss you
Everyone saw me on the last album cover
Holding a pistol, something far from a lover
Beside my brother, S-C-O-T-T
I just laughed 'cause no one can defeat me
This is lecture number two, ""My Philosophy""
Number one, was ""Poetry"" you know it's me
This is ""My Philosophy,"" many artists got to learn
I'm not flammable, I don't burn
So please stop burning and learn to earn respect
'Cause that's just what KR collects
See, what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk?
You walk down the street and get jumped
You got to have style and learn to be original
And everybody's gonna wanna diss you
Like me, we stood up for the South Bronx
And every sucker MC had a response
You think we care? I know that they are on the tip
My posse from the Bronx is thick
In real real life, we roll correctly
A lot of suckers would like to forget me
But they can't 'cause like a champ I have got a record
Of knocking out the frauds in a second
On the mic, I believe that you should get loose
I haven't come to tell you I got juice
I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level
I'll be back, but for now just sekkle!

[Break]
In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
I'll play the nine and you play the target
You all know my name so I guess I'll just start it
Or should I say start this, teaching I'm the artist
Styles and new concepts at their hardest
Yo, 'cause I'm a teacher and Scott is a scholar
It ain't about money cause we all make dollars
That's why I walk with my head up
When I hear wack rhymes I get fed up
Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games
A lot of suckers with colorful names
I'm so-and-so, I'm this, I'm that
Huh, but they all just wick-wick-wack
I'm not white or red or black, I'm brown
From the Boogie Down
Productions, of course, our music be thumping
Others say they're bad, but they're bugging
Let me show you something now about Hip Hop
About D-Nice, Melodie, and Scott La Rock
I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker
Mainly, what I write is for the average New Yorker
Some MCs be talking and talking
Trying to show how Black people are walking
But I don't walk this way to portray
Or reinforce stereotypes of today
Like all my brothers eat chicken and watermelon
Talk broken English and drug selling
See, I'm telling and teaching pure facts
The way some act in rap is kind of wack
And it lacks creativity and intelligence
But they don't care 'cause their company's selling it
It's my philosophy on the industry
Don't bother dissing me or even wishing we'd
Soften, dilute or commercialize all the lyrics
'Cause it's about time one of y'all hear it
And hear it first-hand from an intelligent brown man
A vegetarian, no goat or ham
Or chicken or turkey or hamburger
'Cause to me that's suicide, self-murder
Let us get back to what we call hip-hop
And what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock

[Break]
(""So, you're a philosopher?"")
(""Yes, I think very deeply."")
In about four seconds, a teacher will begin to speak

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
How many MCs must get dissed
Before somebody says, ""Don't f*** with Kris!""?
This is just one style, out of many
Like a piggy bank, this is one penny
My brother's name is Kenny, that's Kenny Parker
My other brother I.C.U. is much darker
Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers
The lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker
Who gets weaker: the king or the teacher?
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Teachers teach and do the world good
Kings just rule and most are never understood
If you were to rule or govern a certain industry
All inside this room right now would be in misery
No one would get along nor sing a song
'Cause everyone'd be singing for the king, am I wrong?
I say yo, what's up? It's me again
Scott La Rock, KRS, BDP again
Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend
With Criminal Minded, an album which is only ten
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records
No more than four minutes and some seconds
The competition checks and checks and keeps checking
They take the album, take it home and start sweating
Why? Well, it's simple, to them, it's kind of vital
To take KRS-One's title
To them, I'm like an idol, some type of entity
In everybody's rhyme, they wanna mention me?
Or rather mention us, me and Scott La Rock
But they can get bust, get robbed, get dropped
I don't play around, nor do I eff around
And you can tell by the bodies that are left around
When some clown jumps up to get beat down
Broken down to his very last compound
See how it sound, a little un-rational
A lot of MCs like to use the word ""dramatical""

[Outro: KRS-One]
Fresh for '88, you suckers

41,Posse On Broadway,Swass,Sir Mix-A-Lot,1988-01-01,304880,51,"

[Verse 1]
Me and Kid Sensation at home away from home
In the black Benz limo with the cellular phone
I'm calling up the posse it's time to get rippin
A freak in each sunroof to keep you suckas trippin
Everybody's looking if you're jealous turn around
The AMG kit keeps us closer to the ground
We're getting good grip from the 50 series tires
The Alpine's bumping but I need the volume higher
Cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
We're rolling Rainier and the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do this sucka mc's wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate the J.R. Ewing of Seattle
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Heading for the strip, yes we're looking for some action
The limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leaning back
Maharaji's watching T.V. with two girlies on his lap
On Martin Luther King the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street so posse move ahead
We all look kinda swass, the crew you can't forget
The Mix-a-lot posse cold ripping up the set

[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

[Verse 2]
Rollin in, my posse was getting kinda bored
There's not another posse with more points scored
We don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas
My homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa
Maharaji's on the def side dancing like a freak
The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny
A real estate investor who makes a lot a money
Clocking lots a dollars, we all got gold
Cruising in this Benz and ain't got no place to go
Wheeling 23rd we saw nothing but thugs
The girlies was too skinny from smoking all them drugs
Cause the rock man got em and their butts just drop
The freaks look depressed because the Benz won't stop
At 23rd and Union the driver broke left
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def
My girl blew me a kiss she said I was the best
She's looking mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier I feel
My posse's on Broadway, it's time to get ill

[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

[Verse 3]
Cruising Broadway and my wheels spin slow
Rolling with your posse is the only way to go
The girlies by the college was looking for a ride
We tried to pick em up but we had no room inside
We put em on the trunk we put em on the hood
Some sat up with the driver they made him feel good
The posse's getting bigger, there's much too many freaks
My muffler is dragging, my suspension's getting weak
Now the freaks are getting hungry & Mix-a-Lot's treatin'
We stopped at Taco Bell for some Mexican eatin'
But Taco Bell was closed the girls was on my tip
They said, ""Go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dick's""
Dick's is the place were the cool hang out
The swass like to play and the rich flaunt clout
Posse to the burger stand so big we walk in twos
We're getting dirty looks from those other sucker crews
Kid Sensation dropped a 20 and didn't even miss it
Skeezer from another crew, she picked it up and kissed it
Her boyfriend's illin, he went to slap her face
My homeboy PLB cold sprayed the boy with mace
Cause I never liked a punk who beat up on his girl
If you don't have game then let her leave your world
We took his girl with us
With him she rode the bus
She gave the boy the finger and the sucker starts to cuss
Boy I got a def posse you got a bunch a dudes
You're broke cold crying about the rock man blues
Ya beat up on your girl and now your all upset
She's with the Mix-a-Lot posse on the Broadway set

[Produced by MC Delite and Prince Paul]

[Verse 1]
Well here's how it started, heard you on the radio
Talking 'bout rap, saying all that crap
About how we sample, giving examples
Think we'll let you get away with that?
You criticize our method of how we make records
You said it wasn't art, so now we're gonna rip you apart
Stop, check it out my man
This is the music of a hip-hop band
Jazz, well you can call it that
But this jazz retains a new format
Point, where you misjudged us
Speculated, created a fuss
You've made the same mistake politicians have
Talkin' all that jazz

[Verse 2: Frukwan + Stetsasonic]
Talk, well I heard talk is cheap
But like beauty, talk is just skin deep
And when you lie and you talk a lot
People tell you to step off a lot
You see, you misunderstood, a sample's just a tactic
A portion of my method, a tool, in fact it's
Only of importance when I make it a priority
And what we sample's loved by the majority
But you a minority in terms of thought
Narrow minded and poorly taught
About hip-hop, playing all the silly games
To erase my music so no one can use it
You step on us and we'll step on you
Can't have your cake and eat it too
Talkin' all that jazz

[Verse 3]
Lies, that's when you hide the truth
It's when you talk more jazz than proof
And when you lie and address something you don't know
It's so wack that it's bound to show
When you lie about me or the band we get angry
Whip out our pen, start writing again
And the things we write are always true
Sucker, get a grip, now we talking 'bout you
Seems to me that you have a problem
So we can see what we can do to solve them
Think rap is a fad? You must be mad
Cause we're so bad we get respect you never had
Tell the truth, James Brown was old
'Til Eric and Ra came out with ""I Got Soul""
Rap brings back old R&B
And if we would not, people could've forgot
We wanna make this perfectly clear
We're talented and strong and have no fear
Of those who choose to judge but lack pizazz
Talkin' all that jazz

[Verse 4]
Now we're not trying to be a boss to you
We just wanna get across to you
That if you're talking jazz, the situation is a no-win
You might even get hurt, my friend
Stetsasonic, the hip-hop band
And like Sly and the Family Stone, we will stand
Up for the music we live and play
And for the song we sing today
For now, let us set the record straight
And later on we'll have a forum and a formal debate
But it's important you remember though
What you reap is what you sow
Talkin' all that jazz

44,No More ?'s,Eazy-Duz-It,Eazy-E,1988-09-13,234360,62,"

[Intro: Eazy-E & Female Interviewer]
We're sitting here with Eazy-E
Believe that
How are you doing?
Alright
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster?

[Verse 1]
Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin', I specialized in gankin'
Whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
(​Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun)​
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear, and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala
Rollin', and runnin' from the police
Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief
Or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
(Eazy-E, were you ever caught slipping?)
Hell naw! Just trippin' off 8-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches! I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
Out anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So... you know who I am
And if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn

[Interlude: Eazy-E & Female Interviewer]
Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called ""gank"" someone?

[Verse 2]
Waitin' for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Looked in... all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
Easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow, 'cause it takes timing
Looked around, and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
'Cause you know it's no time for shakin'
Get what you gonna get, front and center
Or get five years for breakin' and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shh, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key, and I flee
Out the back with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall... don't fall
Wipe my sweat 'cause that was a close call
Gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So... is there any more questions?

[Interlude: Eazy-E & Female Interviewer]
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is...
Have you ever been involved in, like, an armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a 211?
Yeah

[Verse 3]
There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
(Were you slick?)
Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said: ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
The man in the back had a camera
So he came out to test his stamina
Against Eazy-E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I run
Back to the bucket, then I said: ""Punch it""
Took the gun, and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, 'cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
(Is all that true?)
I don't lie
You see... I'm not mister nice guy

[Interlude: Eazy-E & Female Interviewer]
Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?

[Outro: Eazy-E & Female Interviewer]
Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my shit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
Thought, and damn so what?
Down and dirty from the C-P-T
N.W.A and Eazy-E
One more, before we end this session
What's your real age?
No more questions!

45,Mona Lisa,The Great Adventures Of Slick Rick,Slick Rick,1988-11-03,248160,36,"

[Intro: Ricky Walters & Slick Rick]
Ladies, and gentlemen, and lowlifes
It is with outstanding pleasure that we are here to present tonight
Slick Rick, the Ruler! And MC Ricky D!
Doing their smash hit, ""Mona Lisa,"" you know, like the picture?
Anyway, I'd like to take this time out to bow before his divine majesty
Oh, your majesty?
Hmm
Can I kiss your hand?
Mm-hmm
*Kisses*
Enough!
Come your highness, they await you

[Verse: Slick Rick]
Well, it was one of those days, not much to do
I was chillin' downtown with my old school crew
I went into a store to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona—what?
Mona Lisa (What?), Mona Lisa, so men named you
You know what I'm sayin'? So I said
""Excuse me, dear, my gosh, you look nice!
Put away your money, I'll buy that slice!""
She said, ""Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you""
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (PING!) I almost blinded her
She said, ""Great Scott! Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth""
Ha-ha, hah! Had to find that funny
So I said, ""No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief? Please! Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet""
She almost got cut short -- you know, scissors
She tried to disrespect WHO?! The Grand Wizard
Me! ""Well what's your name, son?""
""MC Ricky D,"" but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
""I'm.. sorry and I know that's low class (uhh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past""
She said, ""Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin""
A virgin?! Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin -- with her yay wide gap
I said, ""It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's Ricky:
R - ravishing, I - impress
C -- courageous or careless
K -- for the Kangols which I've got
That I wear everyday and Y -- Why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm..
Quite polite like Walter Cronkite""
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, ""Hey Rick, don't you know playing with these snakes is a sin?!?""
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, ""I don't want to see you playing with these lowlifes no more!
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of our friends""
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it!
And as we were leaving and driving along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song

If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by, foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so, let me hide
The pain and the hurt that you gave me
When you said goodbye
You walked on by

46,Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos,It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back,Public Enemy,1988-06-28,383626,36,"

[Intro]
Bass for your face, London!
Everybody in the house make some noise!
I want everybody in the house to say ""ho!"" (Ho!)
Yo Chuck, kick it to 'em, man!
""A ballad behind bars or you could say real rock from the rock. An unusual musical happening in a most unusual place. The state prison...""
""Get in that cell, nigga!""

[Verse 1]
I got a letter from the government the other day
I opened and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself because they never did
I wasn't with it but just that very minute it occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweating as I dwell in my cell, how long has it been?
They got me sitting in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun to be another one
Public enemy serving time
They drew the line y'all, to criticize me some crime
Nevertheless, they could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm looking for the steel

[Verse 2]
They got me rotting in the time that I'm serving
Telling you what happened the same time they're throwing
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us living in his hell
You have to realize, what its a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up - word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from 1 to 10
But I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it y'all
Cause time and time again
Time, they got me serving to those and to them, I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a C-O
Sleeping on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothing to lose
Cause I'm going for the steel

[Verse 3]
Don't you know I caught a C-O
Falling asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, then he did what I said so
And every man's demand got served
Along with the time they served, decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warning, I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fucking up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like Oliver's neck, I had to get off
My boys had the feds in check
They couldn't try nothing
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out to the ghetto, no sell out
6 C-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinking like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right? Now who wanna get nice?
I had 6 C-Os, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive, I gotta wrap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand, now I'm looking for the fence

[Verse 4]
As I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by 52 brothers bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Going out with a bang, ready to bang out
But power from the sky and from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes and some came close
Figure I trigger my steel, stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-nigga machine
If I come out alive and then they won't come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets flew up
And to my surprise the water tower blew up, who shot
What, who, what, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher than the average bluffer
Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on telling you to c'mon
53 brothers on the run, and we are gone

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yo' man, I don't think they heard you?
Won't you tell 'em what ya name is?

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
My name is Eazy, yeah, this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore, yo' I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
Fillin' up my memo with a touch of my rhyme
Suckers stayin' with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is Eazy or just call me E
But It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin'
I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I cold get ill
But I'm like that and that's an actual fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo' I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who tries to cope
If the rhyme I'm displayin'
And the beat that's playin'
Yo', you could try all-day
And you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W
Cause Eazy's doin' it Compton style
Thats the city and you say you could get some
Yo', it's easier said than done

[Chorus: Eazy-E]
Woo, woo!

[Verse 2: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
Now it's easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model or a Dr. Seuss yo I'm a gangsta
And I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trauma
With the E-A-Z-Y-E comma now that's drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
I'm comin' off hard in the third dimension
With the glare
But you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like you're there
With the E on the gangsta tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer
Dope MC employer on Ruthless and that's my label
To get the money, the women, and cold bust the fat cables, boy
Master Rhyme's a toy
I mean straight, while you suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick, or you lonely
How you gonna diss me if you don't even know me? (Yo Ren!)
Whassup?
Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound
And next time I'm peelin' your cap
To let you know where I'm comin' from
Eazy said it and it shall be done

[Chorus: Eazy-E]
Woo, woo!

[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
Creating dope jams is a part of the cycle
""Eazy-er Said Than Dunn"", yeah, that's the title
Lovin' the ladies, only the fly ones, ya know?
But what if she's ugly?
Eazy come Eazy go
Don't ask to battle me, homeboy, what's that?
You wanna battle me? Boy, ya better be strapped
'Cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin'
Now, that's what I'm sayin'
Said before that I was born in '73
Now everybody wants to know the A-G-E
Girls on the tip, fellas too, it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only 15
The fellas would ignore me
The ladies would adore me
And what was I to do?
I wish they’d let the ladies through
'Cause the ladies, I love 'em
Nice, tender and soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real Eazy, those others be fakin'
Tryin' to gain fame off the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some
Yo', homeboy, it's easier said than done

Woo, woo!

1, 2, 3
And I woke up early this morning and I went to the 5 and dime
I saw this pretty young lady that was real, real fine
I tapped her on the shoulder and said, ""Mmm, mmm, excuse me, ma'am""
She pulled down her pants and said, ""Splack these hams""

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally ""That Girl""
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, ""That Girl""

So we walked her to her house, as she opened up the door
It was heart-shaped bed in the middle of the floor
She pushed me on the bed and this you can bet
In between her legs was real, real wet
So I grabbed her by her thighs and I moved up truly
She jumped off the bed and said, ""Don't touch my booty""
""Don't touch my booty 'cause I won't touch you""
""Don't touch my booty 'cause it's not the thing to do""

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, ""That Girl""
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, ""That Girl""

So we bailed out her house just to get something to eat
We saw her friend named Patty walkin' down the street
Patty turned around as we yelled out her name
She dropped to her knee and began to sing

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, ""That Girl""
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, ""That Girl""

Sally is a girl that likes to play
And if you want some lovin' Sally is okay
She has a different fellow every day of the week
Two or maybe three just to make it sweet
Sally wants a man she can call her own
And sixty-seven hundred she can call on the phone
Sally's never tired and she's never alone
All Sally wants is a fellow with a room

Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sally, whew, ""That Girl""
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

50,Shake Your Thang (It's Your Thing),A Salt With A Deadly Pepa,Salt-N-Pepa,1988-08-02,241573,39,"

(Ow, shake it!)
Yeah, oh, you're lookin' sweet, baby
Yes, indeedy
Funky (get down)

We was on a dancefloor shakin' our thing
To a funky beat with a go-go swing
Everyone was watching, they stared in shock
Amazed at how Salt and Pepa was rock-
In the place with a smile on my face
Some got upset and then tried to base
They called us nasty, said we danced dirty
Claimed we were freaks, cheap, even flirty
Pepa got pissed and pulled out a pump
I was all set not to jet but to jump
Spin broke it up and asked not to break
Said, ""They don't understand the way you...""

Shake your thang, oww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to

Shake that thing, C'mon, y'all, shake it
We could get loose, but we can't get naked
It's not a crime, it's legal, we answered
Look again - see? We're just dancin'
Relax a bit, now ain't that better?
I think it's time for you to get a...
Partner, doe-see, gather in closely
I wanna see the ones that mostly
Front on a cutie, hope you're not fruity
Do your duty and...

Shake your thang, oww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to

Come on, y'all, shake that thing
You got to just show no shame
I want you to shake that thing
Come on, y'all, show no shame

Shake your thang, yeah yeah
Oh, you're lookin' sweet, baby
Owww, I won't tell you how to catch a groove

It's my thing, and I'll swing it the way that I feel
With a little seduction and some sex appeal
It's Friday night, and I just got paid
I'm checking out the fella with the high-top fade
Moving in closely, ready for the kill
Steppin' on a dancefloor, think you're ill
But if I guy touch my body I just put him in check
I said, ""We just met"", ""We can't do that yet""
I'm not a pick-up (no), this ain't a stick up (boy)
I'm not stuck up (yeah), and turn to kick up
And just rock, baby-pop, don't stop
Stick out your butt, and shake what you got

Shake your thang, oww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to

Ooh, I like hip-hop mixin' with go-go, baby
It's my thing, and I shake it crazy
Don't try and tell me how to party
It's my dance, yup, and it's my body
The shirt I wear may be low cut
My jeans fit nice, it shows off my butt
Designer down from head to toe
Oooo, my hair, neck, and fingers is crazy-glow
Now please stop blushin', we're just dancing, dummy
C'mon, we both know I don't want you for your money
Cuz we like to rap so we always rhyme
I like to dance, ooh, and I like to grind
I like this song, I like this beat
I'll see you later, where shall we...

Shake your thang, oww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to

51,Set It Off,Long Live The Kane,Big Daddy Kane,1988-01-01,245960,38,"

[Verse 1]
Let it roll, get bold, I just can't hold back
Or fold 'cause I'm a man with soul
In control and effect, so what the heck?
Rock the discotheque and this groove is what's next
Attack, react, exact, the mack'll move you with
A strong song, as long as you groove to this
I keep the crowd loud when you're hype
Do damage onstage and injure the mic
As I shoot the gift, MC's stand stiff
While my rhymes stick to you like Skippy and Jif
Feel my blood fist, or my death kiss
The rap soloist, you don't want none of this
Supreme in this era, I reign with terror
When I grab the mic, believe you're gonna hear a
Fascinatin' rhyme as I enchant 'em
So let's all sing the Big Daddy anthem
Go with the flow, my rhymes grow like an Afro
I entertain again and Kane'll never have no problem
I can sneeze, sniffle and cough
E-e-e-even if I stutter, I'mma still come off
'Cause rappers can't understand the mics I rip
They sure enough ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped
But my apparatus is up to status
Don't ask who's the baddest, of course, that is
The maker, breaker, taker, my rhymes ache the head
Put it to bed, so watch what's said
Save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
Or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
'Cause I get ill and kill at will
Teachin' a skill that's real, you're no frill
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill your head up
Don't even get up
The teacher is teachin', so just shut up

[Chorus x3]
""I can't hold it back""
Set it off

Now break loose

[Verse 2]
Rappers, take a step back, or you will soon regret that
You ever had to confront me and you can bet that
I come correct, perfect, in full effect
Disconnect, dissect, eject as I wreck shop
Stand in command with the clan
Caravan or van, we go man for man and
Without further ado or any delay
Mister Cee as we say, call him the DJ
Mad Money Murf with the triple M
Smooth the barber keepin' my flat-top trim
Scoob Lover my brother, Scrap Lover my other
Dancin' with the crew, so allow the boys to smother
The floor, and endure just for your pleasure
As the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
Acrobatic, Asiatic, rap fanatic
I get dramatic, and rhymes start flowin' automatically from me
So don't play me, obey me
When asked ""Who's the best?"", you better say me
I'm sendin' sucker MC's headin' north
And if you still want some... set if off!
For you to cope is just a wish and a hope
And if you are what you eat, they're feedin' me dope
'Cause I'm just about as dope as dope can get
Ultimate, legit, Kane is a perfect fit
The king of my kingdom, completin' a cipher
The lyrics I bring them keeps the crowd hyper
As I release the masterpiece
The groove will never cease until Kane says ""Peace""
So, maestro, yo, hit it!
Big Daddy Kane's about to come with it, 'cause...

[Chorus x3]
""I can't hold it back""
Set it off

Now break loose

52,Rebel Without A Pause,It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back,Public Enemy,1988-06-28,302800,49,"

[Produced by The Bomb Squad]

[Intro: Rev. Jesse Jackson]
""Brothers and sisters! Brothers and sisters, I don't know what this world is coming to!""

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
Yes, the rhythm, the rebel
Without a pause, I'm lowering my level
The hard rhymer -- where you never been, I'm in
You want stylin'? You know it's time again
D, the enemy, tellin' you to hear it
They praised the music, this time they play the lyrics
Some say no to the album, The Show
Bum Rush, the sound -- I made a year ago
I guess you know, you guess I'm just a radical
Not on sabbatical, yes, to make it critical
The only part your body should be partyin' to
Panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

[Ad-lib 1: Flavor Flav]
Ay yo Chuck man, I don't understand this, man!
Yo, you got to slow down man, you losin' them!

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
Radio—suckers never play me
On the mix, they just okay me
Now, known and grown, when they're clocking my zone, it's known
Snaking and taking everything that a brother owns
Hard — my calling card
Recorded and ordered, supporter of Chesimard
Loud and proud, kicking live next, poet supreme
Loop a troop, bazooka, the scheme
(Flavor) A rebel in his own mind
Supporter of my rhyme
Designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim I do crime
They on my time ticket

[Ad-lib 2: Flavor Flav]
Ay yo, Chuck, they think we takin' shorts!
Show 'em this is cold medina, man!
Come on, kick it!

[Chorus]
Terminator X, Terminator X
Terminator X, Terminator

[Ad-libe 3: Flavor Flav]
Yo Chuck, you gettin' em nervous
They can't handle this, they gonna break down!

[Verse 3: Chuck D + Flavor Flav]
From a rebel, it's final on black vinyl
Soul, rock and roll coming like a rhino
Tables turn, suckers burn to learn
They can't disable the power of my label
Def Jam, tells you who I am
The enemy's public, they really give a damn
Strong Island, where I got 'em whylin'
That's the reason they're claiming that I'm violent
Never silent, no dope, getting dumb — nope
Claiming where we get our rhythm from
Number one, we hit ya and we give ya some
No gun, and still never on the run
You wanna be an S1 -- Griff will tell you when
And then you'll come again, you'll know what time it is
Impeach the president, pulling out my ray gun
Zap the next one, I could be your Shogun
(Suckers) don't last a minute
Soft and smooth, I ain't with it
(Hardcore) raw bone like a razor
I'm like a laser, I just won't graze ya
Old enough to raise ya, so this'll faze ya
Get it right boy and maybe I will praise ya
Playing the role, I got soul too
Voice my opinion with volume
(Smooth) Not what I am
(Rough) Cause I'm a man
No matter what the name, we're all the same
Pieces in one big chess game
(Yeah!) The voice of power
Is in the house — go take a shower, boy
P.E. a group, a crew — not singular
We wear black Wranglers
We're rap stranglers, you can't angle us
I know you're listening
I caught you pissin' your pants
You're scared of dissing us
The crowd is missing us
We're on a mission y'all

[Ad-lib 4: Flavor Flav]
Yo Chuck, yo! Yeah, man!
Yo, you got 'em runnin' scared!

[Chorus]
Terminator X, Terminator X
Terminator X, Terminator

[Verse 4]
Attitude, when I'm on fire
Juice on the loose, electric wire
Simple and plain, give me the lane
I'll throw it down your throat like Barkley
You see my car keys, you'll never get these
They belong to the Nine-Eight posse
You want some more, son? You wanna get some?
Bum-rush the door of the store — pick up the album
You know the rhythm, the rhyme plus the beat is designed
So I can enter your mind, boys!
Bring the noise — my time
Step aside for the flex, Terminator X

[Ad-lib 5: Flavor Flav]
Yeah, that's right
This jam is rated cold medina, boy
That's right, cold medina, that's right
We showin' up in E-F-F-E-C-T also known as effect
You understand what I'm sayin'?

[Outro]
Yeah! Yeah, boy!
Bring that beat back
Bring that beat back one more time, Chuck
Y'all wanna hear that beat, right?
Bring that beat back

53,Eazy-Duz-It,Eazy-Duz-It,Eazy-E,1988-09-13,259493,55,"

[Intro: Michel'le +  Eazy-E]
He was once a thug from around the way
Eazy, but you should
Bitch shut the fuck up, get the fuck out of here
Yo, Dre (What's up?) give me a funky ass bassline

[Bridge]
What the fuck is up?
In the place to be
Coming on the mic is Eazy-mothafuckin-E
Dre is on the beat, Yella's on the cut
So listen up close while we rip shit up

[Verse 1]
Well I'm Eazy-E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper group coming out the chute
Eazy-E, motherfuckers, cold knocking the boots
'Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster - I used to be a mugster
If you heard (Dopeman), you think I own a drugstore
Getting stupid because I know how
And if a sucker talks shit, I give him a (POW)
8 ball sipping, the bitches are flipping
Slow down, I hit a dip and, continue my tripping
Hitting my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villain cold roaming the streets
And wit a homie like Dre just supplying the beats

[Hook]
Because I'm a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy, you should have known by now, Eazy-Duz-It

[Bridge]
(""I was"") (""knocking muthafuckas out"")
(""What's your name, boy?"")
(""Funky, fresh Eazy-E"")
(""Kick, kick that shit"")
(""Where you from fool?"") (""Compton"") (""Yeah!"")

[Verse 2]
Rolling through the hood, cold tearing shit up
Stick my head out the window and I say what's up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumping the box
But you know that's an alibi for slanging the rocks
A dice game started so I said what the fuck
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jocking 24-7
Rolled them muthafuckas, ate 'em up, hit 11
Got another point, I made a ten a fo'
Was taking niggas money and was itching for mo'
Laughing in their faces and said you're all making me rich
Till one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast
He shot (gunshots), Then I shot (gunshots)
As you can see, I cold smoked his ass (ha ha)

[Hook]
Because I'm a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy-Duz-It

[Interlude: Dr. Dre + Eazy-E (MC Ren)]
Wait a minute, wait a minute, who does it
Muthafuckin' Eazy does it
(But how does he do it)
""Eazy duz it, do it eazy, that's what I'm doing""
(""Stop!"") (Man, whatcha gonna do now?)

[Verse 3]
Now I'ma break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker muthafucka
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must've been starving 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I'm wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yeah I went to jail but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of nine
Call my bitch to get me out 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the ganking zone
All the shit I did for her like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The bailiff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up
And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my Uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the ho

[Hook]
Because I'm a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy, you should have known by now, Eazy-Duz-It

[Outro]
From around the way, born in '73
Harcore B-boy named Eazy-E
It's '88 now, '73's obsolete
A nigga with a serious ass attitude and a hundred percent street
And if you all wanna hear some more...
In one way or the other, I'm a bad brother
Word to the muthafucka

54,A Nightmare on My Street,Greatest Hits,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,1998,298626,21,"

[Intro: Fresh Prince]
Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare on my street!

[Verse 1: Fresh Prince]
It was a Saturday evening, if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and bum rushed the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right though 'cause the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
Buggin', cold havin' a ball
And somethin' ‘bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent, you know nothing real fancy
About this homeboy named Freddy and this girl named Nancy
But word when it was over I said, “Yo, that was def!”
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!

[Verse 2: Fresh Prince & Freddy Kruger]
It was burning in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted, it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I went downstairs to grab some juice or a Coke
Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind
It said, ""You turned off David Letterman, now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside in my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz!""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
""Here's what we'll do, we got a lot of work here, me and you
The souls of your friends you and I will claim
You've got the body, and I've got the brain""
I said, ""Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest, man, this team won't work
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!""
I pat him on the shoulder said, ""Thanks for stopping by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy!""
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt!""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ""Oh please do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed, ripped through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street

[Outro: Fresh Prince, Jazzy Jeff & Freddy Krueger]
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
Come on, come on
Come on Jeff, answer
Come on, man
Hello?
Jeff, this is Prince, man
Jeff, wake up
Jeff, wake up
What do you want?
Jeff, wake up, man
Listen to me, Jeff
It's three o'clock in the mornin', what do you want?
Jeff, Jeff, would you listen to me?
Listen, whatever you do, don't fall asleep
Man!
Jeff, listen to me, don't go to sleep, Jeff
Look, look, I'll talk to you tomorrow, I'm going to bed
RRAHHHH!
Ahhhhhh!
Jeff! Jeff!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaaa!
Ahhhhhh!
Jeff!
RRAHHHH!
Jeff! Answer me, Jeff!
I'm your D.J. now, Princey!
Ahh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaaaa!

We're J.J. Fad and we're here to rock
Rhymes like ours could never be stopped
See, there's three of us and I know we're fresh
Party rockers, non-stoppers, and our es are def
See, the ""J"" is for ""just""
The other for ""jammin'""
The ""F"" is for ""fresh""
""A"" and ""D,"" ""def""
Behind the turntables is DJ Train
Mixin' and scratchin' is the name of the game
Now here's a little somethin' 'bout nosy people
It's not real hard, it's plain and simple
Baby-D

[Chorus: All]
Supersonic

And everybody knows that J.J. Fad is devastating
We know you like us girls so you better get stirl'
'Cause we are the home chicks that are rockin' your world

[Chorus: All]
Supersonic
Supersonic

[Verse 2: Sassy C. & (Baby-D)]
Supersonic is a word when people start to listen
Especially bigger people, they pay close attention
You might not believe it, you might not even buy it
But when it comes to our lady (beatbox)
You might even try it

[Chorus: All]
Supersonic
Supersonic

[Verse 3: MC J.B.]
Now all you supersonic people try to bite our rhymes
You may think that you are def, but you're way behind

'Cause when it comes to J.J. Fad, you can't get no play

[Chorus: All]

He may be a little light, but that's okay

Hit it

[Verse 5: Baby-D & All]
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, it's finally my turn to rock the mic

Show 'em that we can do this, cause we always knew this
Haha, yeah boy!

Bass! How low can you go?
Death row? What a brother know
Once again, back is the incredible rhyme animal
The uncannable D, Public Enemy Number One
Five-O said, ""Freeze!""—and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records, they sell
Cause a brother like me said ""Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do is follow for now""
Power of the people say
""Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical""
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win

Turn it up! Bring the noise!

[Bridge: Flava Flav]
Ayo Chuck, they're saying we're too black, man
Yo, I don't understand what they're saying
But little do they know they can get a smack for that, man

[Verse 2]
Never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt like a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
'Cause the beats and the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music that the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters now, 'cause the country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now
They're gonna have to wait 'till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this

[Hook]
Turn it up! Bring the noise!

[Bridge: Flava Flav]
Ayo Chuck, they illin', we chillin'
Yo P.E. in the house, top billin'
Yo Chuck, show em what you can do, boy

[Verse 3]
Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My DJ is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Making a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, (but we ride limos, too)
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, (Beat is for Yoko Ono)
Run-DMC first said a DJ could be a band
Stand on its own feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B. and LL as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

[Hook]
Turn it up! Bring the noise!

[Bridge: Flava Flav]
Yo, they should know by now that they can't stop this bum rush
Word up, better keep tellin' me to turn it down
But yo, Flavor Flav ain't going out like that

[Verse 4]
From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
""Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast toast""
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last. Why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to plead the Fifth, you can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse in effect, got the Flavor, Terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah, I'm telling you

[Outro: Flava Flav]
Hey yo, Griff, get thirty S1W, we got to handle this
We ain't goin' out like that
Yo man, straight up on the Columbo tip
We can do this, like Brutus
'Cause we always knew this
You know what I'm sayin'
There's just one thing that puzzles me, my brother
What's wrong with all these people around here, man
Is they clocking? Is they rocking? Is they shocking?...

58,Parents Just Don't Understand - Edit,"He's The DJ, I'm The Rapper",DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,1988-03-29,313160,40,"

[Intro]
You know parents are the same no matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes
So to you other kids all across the land
There's no need to argue, parents just don't understand

[Verse 1]
I remember one year
My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first
I just turnеd up my nose
She said, “What's wrong? This shirt cost $20”
I said, “Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!”
Thе next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, “Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep”
She said, “You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet”
I said, “Mom, let's put these clothes back, please”
She said “No, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show”
I said, “This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks”
She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, “No, no way, uh-uh, forget it”
There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, “If they were laughing you don't need them
'Cause they're not good friends”
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand

[Verse 2]
Oh-kay, here's the situation
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't...
Yeah, of course, I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, “Was that for me?”
I said, “Yeah”
She said, “Why?”
I said, “Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy”
She said, “How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic”
I said, “C'mon, toots, my name is the Prince
Besides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?”
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, “Drive fast, speed turns me on”
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sunroof was open, the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, “I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer”
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, “Ah, Mom, Dad... how was your trip?”
They didn't speak - I said, “I want to plead my case”
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you other kids all across the land
Take it from me, parents just don't understand

EAZY!
Come on make some noise!
EAZY!
Ayo Ren lets do this

[MC Ren]
People from everywhere gather around
Checkin' out the sound that Eazy is throwin' down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin' a way with dope style
Yo Eazy, what ya gotta say

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
A miracle of modern creation
Eazy E's on the set, hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal - Otherwise known as a villain
Because I'm ruthless, when I spot a sucka, I kill 'em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

EAZ-Y...

[Michel'le]
(Michel'le)Eazy
Hey eazy
(Eazy)Wassup??
(Michel'le)Why you wear your pants like that?
(Eazy)I wear my pants like this, fo' easy access baby
Yeah thats right

(Ice Cube)
Yo homeboy, where we takin' this jam to?
COMPTON
Where?
COMPTON
Alright

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Yeah 'cuz this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that it's done, I know ya pleased
At how the E just duz it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me 'n' my B-O-Y-Z
From the H-double-O-D
N.W.A., down with me
Strong 'n' I'm ragin'
Turn the page 'n'
See I'm not a son of a gun
I'm a gauge 'n'
Nuthin' can avoid this shot cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckas on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

EAZ-Y...

Yo man, you weren't born in no '73
Why you be lyin' bout your age?
(Eazy-E)
Man, why you gotta bring that up?
Yo, get this fool outta here!

Hey Eazy why you always cussin' on your records?
(Eazy-E)
Who are you, Gene Autry or somethin'?
I just do that to get my point across
Now I wanna know who you came to see

EAZ-Y...

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it
Another example of how Eazy duz it

EAZ-Y
We want Eazy...

[Intro]
Eazy-E: Yo Ren, you're ready to go get this money?
MC Ren: Believe that, boy
Eazy-E: You're strapped?
MC Ren: Yeah, you know it
Eazy-E: Let's go do this shit, man, I got it all planned out
MC Ren: Yeah, shoot any motherfucker that moves

[Sample]
Alright everybody

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
This is a stick-up, everybody get face-down
Ren, gag their mouths so they can't make a sound
Tie em up for the fact that I'm kickin ass
I got my hand on my gat, and I'm tempted to blast
My name is Eazy, but I go the hard way out
This ain't personal, but now I'm about
To commit a crime and go through it
You know what, no need for shaking, because I'm used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah, he's wearing a badge, but he's a old ass man
Pop his ass in the head, and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know so me and my gang, just can't be seen
Lock the doors, and throw away the key
Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers could see
And smile, you know, cause I'm controling of the shit
And no sucker ass nigga's gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs, and a Ruthless shirt
That means I'm ready to work, and rush a fool to the dirt, so

[Hook]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

[MC Ren]
Alright, anybody move and I'll blow your fucking head off

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Alright, empty your pockets, but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fucking floor
Don't make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
I'm in a bank, and it's a little bit funny
Taking all you stupid motherfuckers' money
Peepin' at a bitch cause my dick's on hard
Laughing at the dumb ass security guard
Who's tied up for the moment, not saying a word
I should have known it before, the motherfucker's a nerd
But back to the bitches I'm peepin'
And then untie the hoe, so I can start creepin'
Took her to the backroom, about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in her back
I said: ""Lay down, and unbutton your bra!""
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said: ""Damn!"" then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind, was going up in her
The suspense was making me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick!
I said: ""Damn!"" dropped the gat from my hand
(What I thought was a bitch, was nothing but a man)
Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt, so

[Hook]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

(I said get down. I want you all face-down on the floor
Anybody moves and I shoot)

[Verse 3: Eazy-E &  MC Ren ]
Stacking up the money and there's more to collect
Cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveller's cheques
Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see
Three motherfucking police staring at me; what to do now?
Hurry up and get armed
Alright, tell me, who hit the motherfucking alarm?
I'mma give ya a chance, and count to three
Or else five of y'all bitches are comin with me
(Alright, Alright, come on out niggas, or we're coming in
This is the only chance to turn yourself in)
Fuck you, we got hostages, and plenty of loot
And don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot
We're sending out the hostages, all except five
And if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive
We want a copter, so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along, if you know what I mean
One hostage got brave, and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door
(They shot a hostage, they shot a hostage)
You stupid motherfucker trying to run
Now you're dead as fuck trying to race a gun
(Alright, this is the last chance to get off your ass
Or else the tear gas is about to blast)
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin'
With screamin hostages, running and chokin'
Gettin away, but I was suddenly stopped
At point blank range, by a motherfucking cop
And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught
Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work
So, y'all know what time it is

[Hook]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

[Outro]
(Well I'm giving you five seconds to let us through the gate or I'm gonna shoot two of your guards)

(Hehe, they got me once, but they'll never get me again)

61,Bust A Move,Stone Cold Rhymin' (Deluxe Edition),Young MC,1989-01-01,263266,24,"

[Intro]
Bust it

[Verse 1]
This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya overzealous
Play hard to get, females get jealous
Okay smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by, you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on, people start to dance
But then you ate so much, you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking, guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance 'cause she likes to groove
So come on, fatso and just bust a move

Just bust a move
Just bust a move
Just bust a move

[Verse 2]
You're on a mission and you're wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls, just ugly faces
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope
New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Couldn't care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says, ""Hello
Come sit next to me you fine fellow""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move

[Chorus]
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it, yeah

[Verse 3]
In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way""
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetrating a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move

[Chorus]
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it

[Interlude]
Break it down for me fellas

[Verse 4]
Your best friend Harry, has a brother Larry
In five days from now, he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
'Cause in the ceremony, you'll be the best man
You say, ""neat-o"", check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin', then you start blinking
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks you're kinda cute, so she winks back
And now your feelin' really firm 'cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wanna dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do, G, bust a move

[Chorus]
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it (move it boy)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Now, I rock a house party at the drop of a hat (yeah)
Now, I beat a biter down with an aluminum bat
A lot of people they be Jonesin' just to hear me rock the mic
They be staring at the radio, staying up all night
So like a pimp, I'm pimpin', I got a boat to eat shrimp in
Nothing wrong with my leg, I'm just B-boy limpin'
Got arrested at the Mardi Gras for jumping on a float
My man MCA's got a beard like a billy goat
""Ooh-ooh"" is my disco call
MCA (hu-huh), I'm gettin' rope, y'all
Routines I bust, and the rhymes that I write
And I'll be busting routines and rhymes all night
Like eating burgers or chicken and you'll be picking ya nose, man
I'm on time, homie, that's how it goes
You heard my style, I think you missed the point
It's the joint!

[Verse 2]
Mike D (Yeah?) With your bad self running things
(What's up?) With your bad breath onion rings
Well, I'm Mike D, and I'm back from the dead
Chillin' at the beach, down at Club Med
Make another record 'cause the people, they want more of this
Suckers, they be saying they can take out Adam Horovitz
Hurricane, you got clout
Other DJ's, he'll put your head out
A puppet on a string, I'm paid to sing or rhyme
Or do my thing, I'm in a lava lamp, inside my brain hotel
I might be freakin or peakin', but I rock well
The Patty Duke Show, the Wrench, and then I bust the Tango
Got more rhymes than Jamaica got mango
I got the peg leg at the end of my stump-a
Shake your rump-a

[Verse 3]
A full clout, y'all, a full clout, y'all
And when the mic is in my mouth, I turn it out, y'all
A full clout​
[sound of a bong hit followed by a shotgun noise]
Never been dumped, 'cause I'm the most mackinest
Never been jumped, 'cause I'm known the most packinest
Yeah, we've got beef, chief, we're knocking out teeth, chief
And if you don't believe us, you should question your belief, Keith
Like Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat
Like Fred Flintstone, driving around with bald feet
Should I have another sip? Nah, skip it
In the back of the ride and bust with the whippet
Rope-a-dope dookies all around the neck
Woo-ha! Got them all in check
Running from the law, the press, and the parents
Is your name Michael Diamond? No, mine's Clarence
From downtown, Manhattan, the Village
My style is wild, and you know that it still is
Disco bag schlepping, and you're doing the bump
Shake your rump-a

Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!

[Verse 1: Brother Marquis]
Sitting at home with my dick all hard
So I got the black book for a freak to call
Picked up the telephone, then dialed the 7 digits
Said, ""Yo, this Marquis, baby! Are you down with it?""
I arrived at her house, knocked on the door
Not having no idea of what the night had in store
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning
I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny

[Chorus: Papillon Soo Soo]
Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!

[Verse 2: Fresh Kid Ice]
Girls always ask me why I fuck so much
I say ""What's wrong, baby doll, with a quick nut?""
Cause you're the one, and you shouldn't be mad
I won't tell your mama if you don't tell your dad
I know he'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted
Won't your mama be so mad if she knew I got that ass?
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is sex, cause me so horny

[Chorus: Papillon Soo Soo]
Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!

[Verse 3: Brother Marquis]
You can say I'm desperate, even call me perverted
But you say I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted
I'll play with your heart just like it's a game
I'll be blowing your mind while you're blowing my brains
I'm just like that man they call Georgie Puddin' Pie
I fuck all the girls and I make 'em cry
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning
I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny

Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!

You tell your parents that we're going out
Never to the movies, just straight to my house
You said it yourself, you like it like I do
Put your lips on my dick, and suck my asshole too
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is sex, cause me so horny

Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!

""Go for mine, and run down the line""

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I went from construction Timbs to Ac's with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's that superstar status apparatus, more wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline
I want a presidential Rollie (So)
So I crush MCs to guacamole, making Robin scream, ""Holy moley!""
Big Poppa, fuck a cape, I'm that Paper Crusader
Playing Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Verse 2: Coolio]
I shot dice with a priest and drank yak with a pastor
So it's me, myself and I know, my own lord and master
When your ass was born, it was all on the lone, and
When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

""Go for mine, and run down the line""

[Verse 3: Redman]
It's that Funkadelic Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the vest, niggas better start putting on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk coming in stacks, bullets humming from gats
So I duck, lyrical BUCK BUCK, get stuck
I'm jamming like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
BLADOW! Plus my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang, burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leaving your mic boney like that Tales Of The Crypt bitch (Uh!)
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, I'm busting your ass, counterclockwise
I get Dumb but Dumber, why your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo-ooh-sers

[Verse 4: Ill Al Skratch]
Ayo, Mayday, mayday, raise the white flag
Let the pants sag, fuck the drag (I'm a puff the whole bag)
It's the low down and I'm low-key, the O.G
Niggas know me (True) so take it easy with stakes

[Verse 5: Big Mike]
It ain't surprising these motherfuckers still hating
They must don't know I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike will stomp the head of a snake
Now quakes was felt when my feet hit the ground
And fate is fatal when my heat made a sound
Now, how did I relate what's gonna fall
When my niggas made the fucking final call

[Chorus: Ill Al Skratch]
It ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like that

Hey, you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You best believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around, my people start subtracting
They cause this shit, then they wonder why we start overreacting
Hey, ay, ay, you can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'm a hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me go inside, ""Please give me room, yo step aside""
Ha, those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there dropping dimes
Get your shit drawers up out my hammer
Young survivalist represent the next Black Panther

[Verse 7: Buckshot]
I stepped in the jam with the guard on my side
And the guard S.T. is still waiting in the ride
So I stepped to the DJ and told the DJ
""Yo, throw the wax on"" ""How many emcees must get dissed""

[Verse 8: Layzie Bone]
Putting your shit to the pave, ending 'em meeting the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazing, nothing phased
Bone, my deadly fist of brothers, ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, you dearly departed, better off

[Verse 9: Wish Bone]
Living the psycho path so I'm down with a buck and a blast and getting my chance
You niggas are fearing my sawed-off
Blew thee to rest, so fast to blast
So if you, thinking defeat, you need, to best, be packing your shit, you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cuz, when we a done with the quickness

[Verse 10: Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, bucking em once a
Gain enough to pick a defender
They try to contend us, see, all they gon' win is that Mac-10
There's never another to go with a brother, while smotherin' suckas been gon' undercover
We leave em in gutters, ain’t gonna get caught. But who was the sucker that squealed on a murda?

[Verse 11: Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street, sweeper, better R.I.P. and pray
The bullet don't put in much work but I'm a sure, with, shot
Puttin' the bullets just where it hurts, and um
With a me tech'll slip up one on the popos, Bone, Bone
Better be nothing to me, you set up, wet up
Get 'em on the get up, Bone won't let up

I'm going back to Cali... hmm, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... I don't think so

[Verse 1]
Going back to Cali, stylin', profilin'
Growlin', and smilin', while in the sun
The top is down, on the black Corvette
And it's fly, 'cause it's sittin' on Daytons
Nardi steering wheel, plushed out, gold-leaf phantom top
And three girls waiting
VRRRROOM engine's blowin', the chrome, is shinin'
Passing all the cars on the way
Movement of the wind, back wheels spin
Pop in a cassette and push play

I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... hey y'all, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali

I'm going back to Cali, shakin' 'em, bakin' 'em
Takin' 'em to spots they never before hung
I know a place, off Sunset it's a trip
Where the A.C.'s cold, but the girls still strip
The record skipped, but this girl kept dancin'
Prancin', grindin', grinnin,' romancin'
I asked her to the barn, so we could hit the hay
I wanna do this, Brutus, but I don't wanna pay

I'm going back to Cali... man, I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali

[Verse 3]
I'm going back to Cali, risin', surprisin'
Advisin' realizin', she's sizin' me up
Her bikini - small; heels - tall
She said, she liked, the ocean
She showed me a beach, gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast, but this girl was faster
She's lookin' for a real good time
I said, ""Close your eyes, I got a surprise""
And I ran away with the bottle of wine

[Hook]
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... I don't think so
I'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali
I'm going back to Cali... I don't think so

[Maseo]
Me, Plug Three, the one they call Baby Huey
The one that gets all the buddy (all the buddy)
Yeah, that's right

[Mike G]
A fat funky fruit with a whole lot of tang
A little something called ""Doing Our Own Thang""
Breaking the beat others wished they broke
Bassline so dope that you just might choke
Don't bite off something that you can't chew
And don't trail behind when I'm coming through
Fronting the feel that you really can't feel
'Cause you're trying to feel what's on my reel to reel

[Q-Tip]
A tree is growing
Can't you see what I see? A white blue fruit to boot
We count to ten before we pass the coots, now that's family
Equipped with the brothers and the sisters and the sisters and the brothers
And all others, with the funky flairs, the bugged-out hairs
It's the life of Riley, I'm really ready
Gazing at the gala filled rap
The cool june bugs, the wicks, the wacks
Praise the rhythms for what it be
And praise the Lord for the JB's

[Hook: Queen Latifah]
We're doing our own thang
We're doing our own thang
We're doing our own thang
We're doing our own thang

[Posdnuos]
Isn't it cool when you cut your hand
And then the blood is red instead of sellout green
This is not the music for an RnB mind
This is flower intertwined with a vine
(In other words this is rose)
You see what I mean? Or see what Grandpa Bam saw
The funk we transmit is unstable
One condition if I am able to say
(Yes you may) Well hey, let's get on with it
Vocal confetti is thrown, sometimes spitted
Out the vents of hecklers and fans
Either which way they all hop on the van
The band, the band, here comes the band
The tribe of fingers all on one hand
Me, myself, and I is dark
Monie Love the mouthpiece, it's now yours to spark

[Monie Love]
Sister Monie, the only one here who missed a plane back to London
Residing with my brothers and I learned a lot from them
About the groove, how to be smooth and play funky
And sometimes rated it's kind of funky, but it's cool
For we are beyond the stereotypes
Coordination crazy, but still it sounds hype
Rocking off and on beat, and I do believe I'm right (You're right)
Am I wrong? (Yeah, sike!)
Don't be mad, be glad I missed the plane, I'm staying
With the Brothers Jungle, Soul, and the Tribe, I'm saying
Funky funky rhymes that always stay in swing
I believe we doing our own thing

[Hook]

[Afrika]
Well my family sets all the trends
From Soul II Soul on to Loose Ends
A&R men sign groups like them
('Cause that's where the money's at, honey)
Yeah, the industry's filled with copycats
RnB mixed with sloppy raps
Tribes like us always open doors
But what for, so you can get yours?
You ain't in to it, all you want is profit
So I ask you please to stop it
Leave me alone, get off my bone
'Cause I'm doing my own...

[Mike G]
A new seed, a new breed
A new menu to feed the greed
A new pair of boots for a new piece of butt
Sweet Daddy, are you there? (Sammy B is on the cut!)
Spinning back for a rap that's laid back
Ready to kick back, those that give no slack
I may rock a rhyme or I may start to sing
But still, I'm doing my own thing

[Dove]
In comes the mood of Jungle and Daisies
Play the sing and let the vibes raise me
All hold hands and let's walk about
Form a circle and talk about
Don't follow the path that we're stepping
Truth to the soul is what I'm cramming
Reasons for this is that the family's strong
And like Bob Marley said ""We're jammin""
Seeing is believing, so see and believe
And let the groove of the new proceed
A whole bunch of love, peace signs, and fun
So let's do what's got to be done, you know?

67,"Warm It Up, Kane",It's A Big Daddy Thing,Big Daddy Kane,1989,254026,45,"

[Verse 1]
Come, get some, you little bum
I take the cake, but you can't get a crumb
From the poetic, authentic, superior
Ultimate, and all that good shit
I'm the original Asiatic, acrobatic
There you have it, now get dramatic
Creatin' drama when I'm on the scene
And I pack 'em in mean, like Bruce Springsteen
I profile a style that's mild and meanwhile
Put on trial a rap pile to exile
Make you tumble and stumble, in a rumble just crumble
And I'm still calm and humble
You need another helpin' hand to swing on
I stand alone, but still you gotta bring on
Your Batman and Robin, Cagney and Lacey
Starsky and Hutch, but they still can't face me
And if may make this one thing here clear
That's for you not to come near, period!
For I ain't buggin' or delirious
My swift tongue's like a sword, that's how severe it is
And I can slice and dice a Fisher-Price MC
That thought he was nice into Minute Rice
Single-handed, I ain't with that band stuff
'Cause Cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff
And the mic I ravage, not like a savage
But in my own way of doin' damage
As I design the genuine line
Now, who flat top rules in '89?

[Hook x16]
Warm it up, Kane!

[Verse 2]
Take two of the man with soul that you probably know
Deadly as Scarface, but bright as the Cosby Show
Don't attack rappers, but make everyone hush
They step to me, but can't stop the bum rush
I make material rich and imperial
The unique technique I speak is all original
You like to sag and drag and gag
Same old same old, but papa's got a brand new bag
So put the mic down, boy, you can't work it
Due to wack lyrics that's 'bout to short-circuit
So toss the sauce across to the boss
No remorse, you lost, with force I cause a holocaust
First I caught ya, then put ya through torture
You moved wrong, my son, so I taught ya
Just like a guardian, now put your body in
The mood to groove with the smooth way that I'm partyin'
Competition may find it spectacular
Scheme and fiend to take a bite like Dracula
And waste the taste, 'cause ain't no sugar here
So come near if you dare, you Booga Bear
You start hallucinatin' like magic
The wrath gets tragic, but Kane won't have it
'Cause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin'
Slowed the pace, so I had to start rushin'
So pick a B.C. date 'cause you're history
Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap, Jay, and Mister Cee
And this is one thing to us we ain't new to
The crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo
I'm the man you can't hold back
And all competition appears to be weak
I meant to say wack, a vision of blur
Just them thinkin' I'm competitin', I say, ""Huh!""

[Hook x16]
Warm it up, Kane!

[Outro]
Genuine for '89, you know what I'm sayin'?
As I give a shout out to my man Tony A
Tony P, Sally Sal and the whole Libra Digital posse
Can't forget my man Yawnski
And Smooth the Barber, you know what I'm sayin'?
Also, I gotta say whassup to Born True, B-Boy
And my man big Jay-Z
The whole rest of the crew, Scoob Lover my brother
Scrap Lover, and DJ Mister Cee
Can't forget Supreme, Abu, MelQuan and Shabazz
Wally D, and the rest of the brothers
And of course my little brother, the Little Daddy Shane
Mandatory end to the story, you know what I'm sayin'?
Peace!

Kickin it, vickin, the suckers who be jerkin
Me and my posse are hardcore, you want some more
Reason that I'm squeezin your girl (You never please her!)
So I pleased, then I threw her in the gutter
Cut her off, my wisdom wiser so I muster
Rows of all opposed, lows conquer all
Those who pose as dope I say nope, I wear def clothes
Dapper like Dan from, three the hard one
Never stigmatize as a rapper or I'll slap ya
You're stung from my tongue as you run from the drum

A branch of the hip-hop tip grills your dome
You're toe ingrown low showin you ain't got nobody home
Prone to the microphone, light up, and take out
Make out your will Bill, three is gonna break out

Embark on a mission that's deadly, break out the ammo
Ay, yo, Sammo, hook up the beat
And I'll lay the plan OH man
You just got taken, I took a head out
Attack on the back of the six of the Guinness Stout
Usin abusin, those of the past tense
Funning gunning, but I'm summing up the nonsense
Three, the hard way, cards laid are OK
Gettin up and settin up, just for a payday
The minister, sinister (I ain't no devil!)
Not a snake slithering scoundrel Sam level
This track to SMACK, the smile off a doubter
The brother's, another MC who's about
Frontin like he's buntin, deceivin the delinquent
Rappers on track, bustin out a medium
For those opposed, who manifest a diss

Not righteous, but might just, make you wanna listen

A ludicrous buddhist, Brutus when I do this
So true to this, perpetrators view this
Style, empirical, lyrical, it's critical
Three the hard way, boy you need medical attention
I'm like a surgeon in my left hand
Hold a microphone like a scalpel so you understand
Wordz of wisdom, woven like a spider
Bitch on my tip, I get busy and I ride her
Uptown, then I drown her like a psycho-pathic
Cause I'm graphic on the mic I never let go
Light skinner eat dinner like a soul man
Prove with the rhyme I'm down, Sam's hands
Transform strong (too strong) as a good pitch
Switch up the wizdom, it's a word which
Kicks out the Benzi in a frenzy it sends me
Up the Bronx River back to Brooklyn apprehends me
Like a d-tech bustin my man in the projects
I'll send you up North, I ain't gettin' respect
Prejudicial, your style artificial
As live as limb that's attached to a cripple
It's simple (so simple) eliminate you like Gotti
I chill in Bed-Stuy and drive a Mazzeratti
With the body of a freak on my side, how am I livin?
(How ya livin?) Larger than large, with the wordz of wizdom

Hyper-selective, Serch is attracting
Females who focus on the future, not slacking
Rhythmic it's too quick, feel it, I let it flow
Sam Sever seas'll submerge, so let it go
Throughout, or put out, lyrics like a d-valve
Speak up, a deeper meaning as I leak out
And seek out, a three the hard way endeavor
Pete Nice, Serch, produced by Sam Sever
Livin in my shoes boy, this is not Shoe Town
A showdown for Motown, it's a new sound
Lyrics that lick, the tick off a timepiece
Foamin at the mouth punk, you need a leash
What are you sick?? I'm a slick stupid scientist
Rhymin that you can't comprehend (but you're buyin this)
Record I'm wreckin, my homeboys are breakin
Hopin that you're copin, no slopin, I'm not takin no shorts
Cause I'm playin the high post
Ask any girl in the place, who's the fly most
Brother with a cover, shootin to my cribbo
The tease wants a please, girl screamin ditto
So I did this, I needed the bed rest
Hangin with the bangin on the strength, there's no contest
Physically or lyrically, it's my kingdom
Stingin em and bringin em the wordz of wizdom

Just like Paul Lynde, you're all in...

Brace yourself, I'm the ace with grace
I'm a win the race and make you feel disgrace
In any case, yo, I'm movin like a steeplechase
MC soldiers: about face
Now step off, I need room for my takeoff
My custom made lyrics slay, yours are soft
I think you better tape this, yo, you can't escape this
Yo, I planned it out just like a landscapist
Whipper-snapper back up for comin' crap up
I plan to trap a MC and kidnap a phony
So skip the baloney
You and your cronies need to jump on a pony
And roll, cause you're just a rookie
When it was time for rap school, you must have played hooky
I'm the show-stopper, your rhymes are improper
I'ma teach you like the master taught the grasshopper
Just gettin warmer, I'm a transform a
Regular rhyme into a barnstormer
Try to jump, I'll pump you, chump, my job is thorough
Any MC, state, city or borough will get ragged
I drop like a sandbag
Serious as the mob, I don't play tag
Best of the batch, no man can catch up
Holes can't be patched, our battle's a mismatch
I flip lyrics like a acrobat
And avoid combat like a diplomat
But when it's time for back-crack, or Jack to kill
It's a thrill to drill, a run-of-the-mill bill
With my skill, I'm the lord of rhymes
And I be writing at a rapid pace way past my bedtime
I rock the mic unlike some brothers I know
I guess they flow, PSYCH!

Droppin 'em

Yo, you're all in, stiff as a mannequin
I'm sharp as a pin, and I'ma teach discipline
I get busy like it's two of me
Evidently, I'm hated by a few MCs
But so what? I just max like I'm playing the sax
And take the crowd to the climax
Yo, Cool J, I never go astray
I'm funky, you can hear me at the Milky Way
You're weak, wet grass, I'm cool as jazz
Got razamatazz, ask my man Shabazz
I know you're afraid because I'm self-made
I invade, and blow up like a hand grenade
MCs are terrorstruck, I'ma run amok
Cause your rhymes suck, you made a record on potluck
Just a toyboy, can't stop my convoy
Rhymes I said last year were just decoys
I'm like a fox, you annoy me like chicken pox
I'm back with a style that's unorthodox
You must've had a teaspoon full of bull
I'm like The Hulk, with more bulk, I'm powerful
They try to get with this, to me that's an insult
Boys shouldn't mess with an adult, that's too difficult
I enter like a giant saying ""fee fi foe fum""
Then rock the auditorium until there's pandemonium

I'm droppin 'em
Droppin 'em

Don't sleep, cause I'ma go deeper
All you sleepers, I'm the Grim Reaper
My rhymes are rising, the angle's getting steeper
I hated Mussolini, Martini so I'ma sweep a
Emcee, like he's one of the two
Break him into fragments right in front of you
Mic check, one, two, is too fundamental
My rhymes are monumental over an instrumental
In the center, I had to enter
Tormentor mentor experimenter and inventor
Of lyrics, so all you nonbelievers
It'll echo in your dreams at night when you receive a
Rude awakening, you can't do anything
You enter my kingdom and you cry as men bring
Gifts to the prince of excellence and magnificence
Alarm clock rings, you wake up, and you're convinced
That the crew invader, soloist exterminator
Greater evader of ducks, concert crusader
Is bad, my nickname's the circuit breaker
Eating up the world, acre by acre

71,Just a Friend,Just a Friend - EP,Biz Markie,2009-06-11,238266,59,"

[Verse 1]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on!
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build a
Relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say: ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
Jus' bust this

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
So please, listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...

Well excuse me, take a few minutes, to mellow out
Big Daddy Kane is on the mic and I'mma tell about
A minimum length, of rhymes of strength
And power, so listen to the man of the hour
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
Sing ho, swing low, then yo the show
Will go on, as I perform
Transformin' on stage like a Decepticon
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I'm for real, shootin' lyrics like a harpoon
Across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
So let's groove with the smooth operator

""Cause I'm so smooth...""

The B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E
I'm good and plenty, servin' many and any
Competition, wishin' for an expedition
I'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
Rappers act so wild, and love to profile
Frontin' hard but they ain't got no style
I give nightmares to those who compete
Freddy Krueger, walkin' on Kane Street
Confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
Who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
Destruction from the exterminator
But in a calm manner, cause I'm a smooth operator

[Hook]
""Cause I'm so smooth...""

[Verse 2]
Now girls step up to this
One simple kiss, and it's over, miss
Sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
Girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
So just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
Cause It's a Big Daddy Thing
And I'm lovin' 'em right, word is bond
So just play Marvin Gaye and Let's Get It On
I make it real good like Dr. Feelgood
To make sure that my point is understood
That when it comes to this there's none greater
Sincerely yours... the smooth operator

[Hook]
""Cause I'm so smooth...""

[Verse 3]
Now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
Sayin' I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
The smooth way I say 'em and the way I display 'em
To make them sound different in a way that's gifted
And hey I'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine
And I make one line, bright as the sunshine
Attack you like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know -- step off
Competition, I'mma get rid of
You can't get a bit of, so just consider
A break or rest, vacation, hibernation
And make way for my smooth operation
I'm a smooth operator

[Hook]
""Cause I'm so smooth...""

Ahhhhh yeahhh, and you don't stop
Genuine for '89
And I still ain't half-steppin, peace!

[Verse 1]
My mellow, Latee, was kicking flavor
The R.E. posse said ""Yo Latifah we can do this""
So I paused and took a thought
Then my brillance I caught
And I agreed because I already knew this
Now you should want to flex
Cause I'm in full effect
Queen Latifah is five-oh on this set
You've been begging and dying
For somebody's rhyming to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave you me
I'm coolin', teaching those needing schoolin'
And the mic? This mic in my hand? I'm rulin'!
So prepare your mind for my lifeline
And meet the new Queen of Royal Badness
Latifah has the spirit so head for the water
And dive into the wrath of my madness

[Chorus]
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

[Verse 2]
Some MCs act bold and arrogant
Vain and using each other to compete with
These subjects I pity
Cause their rhymes are not witty like mine
To write a rhyme that's so delicious you can eat it
There are those who like my taste
But don't consider biting
There's penalties for those who don't do right
And just be reciting
Everyone else's word that took a lot of thinking
It's not our fault your thoughts are shrinking
Well, mine are growing
Yes you know like all the woman inside of me
Despite what you do or say
And even in spite of me
Brothers, catch my eye with little hijinks like eye winks
Dying to have a lover of my likeness
So release all your shyness
Just call me ""Your highness""
And dare to feel the wrath of my madness

[Chorus]
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

[Verse 3]
Word of mouth is always everlasting
And everlasting are the words that I bring
The ruler of the ring is Lord Ramsey
And music is made by Mark the 45 King
You tremble for my treble
You're begging for the bass
The voice is too vicious
The same as the pace
The crowds, they love me
The brothers give only hugs
Their shrink-to-fit button-flies fit quite snug
As a bug, you know why? Because I'm bugging
Off the beats that DJ Mark is loving
So plex off the sounds that I'm pumping
I'm jumping with energy to turn your mind to gladness
Come on, just get into it
Don't lie and say you've been through it
Feel the wrath of my madness

[Chorus]
Cost of living getting higher
Cause them to run away
Queen Latifah getting higher
Cause them to run away

[Verse 4]
The scene is mine cause I took it
I took it for the money and I took it for the fun
Don't step up in my face
You don't want to feel the taste
Don't try to play me out
Cause I am not the one
Brothers on my bra strap
Sisters clocking my sound, why?
Because they wanna be down with the
Queen L-A-T-I-F-A-H in command
I supply the concept for you to understand
For those who want to bite
Don't make me have to fuss
The only thing you get is the gluteus maximus
Suckers on the tip
You're loving me, you're leaving me
You wish that one day you could have this
Come on, you know the time
Just be thankful for the rhyme
And get up on the wrath of my madness

You and that bitch playing Too $hort rhymes
If you ask me what it's all about, I'll say it's about that money
But if you ask me could you have some, I'll say it doesn't concern me
Ronald Reagan came up to me and said, ""Do you have the answer
To the U.S. economy and a cure for cancer?""
I said, ""What are you doing in the White House if you're not selling cocaine?
Ask your wife, Nancy Reagan, I know she'll spit that game
Like one night, she came to my house, and gave me a blow job
She licked my dick, up and down, like it was corn on the cob""
What is life? Life is Too $hort
I play young bitches like it's a sport
Yeah, I play the bitches just like y'all
Like Dr. J played basketball
You can call me Too, don't say it twice
You'll get me real mad and I'll fuck your wife
You see I'm not proper, I'm rarely polite
Too $hort, Too $hort, don't say it tonight, biatch
It started on a bright morning in 1987
I was in my drop-top Caddy y'all
Getting sucked by a bitch named Helen
Nasty bitches, around the world, I wrote this rhyme for you
You might not like my rap, but I'm telling you bitch it's true
So much death in the Oakland streets
Am I gonna live till next week?
Will I get shot by a dope fiend
Trying to get high, trying to steal my ring?
I really can't say, 'cause I don't know why
People out here dropping dead like flies
I used to see a home boy, give him five
Now I say, ""Man, you still alive?""
Cold as hell, this town I'm from
Won't last too long when you're faking the funk
I'm the master rapper, so unique
Clap my hand when I want my freak
You can't deny it, you know I'm right
I turn any rapper out when I'm on the mic
And I won't kick back, or relax
Till he knows I'm the best at the MC rap
Till he knows Too Short, set the trap
That got him caught up in my serious cap
Motherfucker can't spit straight game on the mic
'Cause he's worse than a fag or a Frisco dyke
He's a sucker MC, I call him punk
Trying to spit that rap, you can scratch that junk
You little punk-ass boy, wouldn't listen to me
Think I'm faking but I'm taking all you sucker MC's
To the end of the world and push you over
Good luck couldn't find you in a four leaf clover
If I ever said a rap trying to cap on you
I wouldn't even sweat it 'cause you'll be through
Looking so far up, you might fall down
Getting clowned by the hound from east Oaktown
And the look in your face when you're looking at Too
Could make a grown man die, laughin' at you
'Cause you're a no rappin', no rhymin'
Played out fake ass Simple Simon
I never understood one word you said
But you're swearing up and down that you're killing me dead
There's only one thing, I wanted to know
Sucker motherfucker, where's the joke?
I'm the player of players, just call me Pop
My name is Too $hort, no I don't stop
I just don't stop mackin', don't stop cappin'
Don't stop rappin', now you see what happens
Your mind is gone, your crew just cut
Sucker MC I'll tell you what
Your rhymes are weak, your rap the same
And when it comes to game, you are lame
Never even heard of Too $hort baby
Hit Oakland in 1980
Singing more raps than a rap could rhyme
Telling sucker MC's don't waste my time
There's a girl I know her name is Betty
Straight to the head just rock it steady
She's so freaky she'll juice you up
All the home boys just can't get enough
She's a Ph.D., don't even stop
In the back like that going chop chop chop
I won't say white girl, won't say she's black
She's the kind of girl that make your knees go crack
Feel the beat, rock with me
Let me tell you what I be
I'm a MC rapper, a MC rapper
A big bank roller and a cold, cold capper
Hey baby, I got this rhyme
It's not gonna stop till the end of time
Like rock and roll I'll play that song
To the beat all day and all night long
So listen up, to what I'm saying
I'm a Oaktown mack, bitch I ain't playing
To all the home boys doing time in the pen
Gonna rock this beat for you once again
If you can't get out and you're mad as hell
Say beeatch, now make it sound for real
I'mma tear shit up if I get the chance
I could give a fuck less if your ho don't dance
See I'm a big mack now, I'm so great
I was born and raised in the Golden State
Call me T.O.O.; if you say $hort
I'mma rap my ass off till you give me some more
Big bank, now just make me rich
Bitch bitch bitch bitch make me rich
Check out my style, baby I don't quit
I heard this freak say, ""That's the shit
He took the cake, fucked the rake
Too $hort baby damn sure ain't fake.""
But the sucker MC's are screaming loud
Saying Sir Too $hort, shut your mouth
How can you talk about me, and call me weak
When your father smokes coke and your mother's a freak
So I keep on rappin' if nothing else
Keep your jealous ass thoughts to yourself
[Bitch] Picture this, he's a MC right
[Bitch] Ain't saying nothing but he's holding the mic
[Bitch] Fuck with me, and boy you're doomed
I'll send a trick with a ho to the motel room
'Cause I'm the coldest MC on a microphone
Like a .357 pointed at your dome
I got cap for cap, you never heard
So fresh again with cusswords
Motherfucking shit, fucking with me
Fuck a skank bitch and a sucker MC
All you bastards got the claps
And fuck you punk 'cause you still can’t rap
Cusswords, just let em roll
Motherfucking shit, God damn asshole
Cusswords, just don't quit
Motherfuck you damn shithead bitch
It's Too $hort, on the mic, and it don't stop
And it don't stop, and it won't stop, beeatch
Check out my style

75,Know How,Stone Cold Rhymin' (Deluxe Edition),Young MC,1989-01-01,242880,50,"

[Verse 1]
Some of the busiest rhymes ever made by man
Are goin' into this mic, written by this hand
Are comin' out of this mouth, made by this tongue
I'll tell you now my name, my name is Young
But do you think that it's your destiny
To get the best of me, but I suggest to be
Quiet, bro', don't even try it from the east and west of me
Takin' it and never breakin' it or even shakin' it
Groovin' it and always movin' it, cuz I'm not fakin' it
Pullin' out rhymes like books off the shelf
Born in England, raised in Hollis, taught to go for myself
This is stone cold rhymin', no frills, no fluffs
And it's no accident that these rhymes sound tough
I'm goin' off, baby, there's no turnin' back
I'm on your TV, on your album, cassette, and 8-track
And when the show is finally finished I'll be takin' my bow
My name is Young, and yo I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how
Party people
I got know...how
I kick it just like this...

[Verse 2]
I got juice like the president, I'm makin' rappers hesitant
Invite me to your house and I'll be chillin' like a resident
Yes, cuz I'm that type of man
Cuz I make myself at home no matter where I am
I got it rollin' like thunder, makin' Y'all wonder
Why I'm on top with all the other rappers under
I make no errors, mistakes or blunders
It's like a wedding, let no man put asunder
My name is Young MC, I like to rock mic well
Cuz when I get up on the mic I just release my spell
It's no hocus-pocus, I'll just get you into focus
And swarm all over you just like a horde of locusts
Smooth operator, female persuader
Spot a fly girl and in a week I'm gonna date her
I got the kind of style for the here and the now
And I can do it cuz I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how
Party people
I got know...how
Bust it!

[Verse 3]
MC's I'll ruin, cuz I know what I'm doin'
I'll treat 'em like Doublemint gum and start chewin'
I spit 'em out when the flavor's gone
And I repeat the chewin' practice 'til the break of dawn
Cuz I'm tough like a bone, sly like Stallone
Rockin' and clockin' on the microphone
Smooth like a mirror, in hearts I strike terror
Rhymes like runs and hits with no errors
Cold like a blizzard, on the mic I am the wizard
With the funky fresh rhymes comin' out of my gizzard
Never sneezin', never coughin', I rock the mic often
Hard as a rock and no sign I'll soften
Makin' sure I get respect, on my mind rhymes connect
I start to build like a builder from an architect
Movin' all around, above and under the ground
You see my face, and then you hear my sound
Comin' atcha with the mic in hand
I'm gonna take command just the way I planned
Cuz I'm a one-man band and you are my fan
Don't you understand? I'm like Superman
Yeah, the Man of Steel, don't you know the deal?
You better be for real, I got sex appeal
This is what I feel, and this here's my vow
And now you know the brother with know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how...
And I'm chillin'
Never illin'
In my mouth, I got two fillins...
Whatever!
I'm on the mic, cold stone gettin' over
My name is Young MC, known as the fly casanova, kick it...

76,Steppin' To The A.M.,The Cactus Album (Expanded Edition),3rd Bass,1989-11-14,290466,17,"

*sound of clocks ringing*

[Verse One: MC Serch]
Ready in the intro, cue up the Serch-lite
Point us to the center stage (I'll grab the first mic)
Projectin the voice with this mic that I'm cuffin
You ain't my nucka, SUCKER I'm snuffin
The word of the 3rd stands true, so no panickin
(Man verse man) you freeze up like a mannequin
Petrol, you let go, the wax for the new jacks
To dwell upon you're steppin on the trigger as the tune smacks
(Square in the butt) Pete gave me the cue
So I'mma put up or shut up until my jam is through
But for now I wanna freak em, so I'll embark
To spark your mission posse, til way past dark
(Don't park there's no standin) or I'll play the five-oh
You don't stop movin until the Serch says so
To keep the tribe open, shootin out to play em
Three the hard way'll keep you steppin' to the A.M

[Beastie Boys samples playing]
(At the sound of the tone, the time will be 1 A.M.)

[Verse Two: Pete Nice]
My mind has a question, I respond
To a silver domed microphone (one step beyond)
Straight to eighty-eight to the curves of the 90's
I'm universal, I set a line free
Behind me, the three the hard way, the jackpot
(Awaitin Satan's, tryin to take cheap shots)
We groove crowds, the three stand proud
The brothers round the way sit down and say
(How'd you do this?) Ludicrous rhythm of rhyme
Anticipate like a bottle of Heinz.. KETCHUP
(No catch up!) Cause you fell behind
I'm steppin to the A.M. -- dickin down swine
Pete Nice skims over lyrics, I pick em
Strong and long, you're wrong, I stick em
(He's the law with the sword) with my cable swingin
(Like _The Pit or the Pendulum_) Pete Nice bringin
The sunrise with no lies, legitimate (and you despise)
Envy this MC's magnitude (so realize)
The MC emceed (The DJ deejayed em)
Until the next time I keep you steppin' to the A.M

[Sample]

[Verse Three: MC Serch]
No weight on the felt plate, deep bass below rise
Needle torture groove, move the record til the wack stride
(Schoolin the swine on the strength of my vocab)
Bet you wonder you're a goner
(You're thinkin that you had)
Lyrics to the A.M. but the house needs a swinger
You st-st-st-st-stutter, but I'm a stinger
(My rhymes so potent, I wrote em and it's evident)
You're just a stunt, seekin a settlement
The lyrical line (The article original)
Afflict like a convict, I ain't no criminal
Schemin on a cable or slobbin the knob
You played me like a foul ball
(How you livin Hobbes?!?!!)
Now groove into the A.M., the master spoon feedin
Out a jumper, you're bumpin a freak while I'm G'n
Peter let the record spin (Serch'll get a second wind)
MOTIVATE THE CROWD, til it's steppin' to the A.M

[Sample]

[Verse Four: Pete Nice]
I slide swiftly, keep a brother steppin
(loungin, strength in my throat)
Sweatin as you get hit with the rhythm
My lines sustain like a crane, so uplift them
(slow and smooth) Flowin like fluid
The mass did worship the lyrics the three did
(amid all crisis) Drop it like a guillotine
(You're moist) fearing the voice of the rhyme fiend
Scene is zipped, Pete Nice is your worst dream
Fulfilled your illed I thrilled (I heard a LOUD scream)
My mind is cued, so I run down a menu
That downgrades the weak as my lyrics tend to
(the needs of a shaker, sweatin to the point of exhaust)
So listen to the mission horse
Blinded by the science, my mind starts flexin
Sexin down females to the A.M., perplexin
A complex reflex (you wonder if we slumber)
The three don't sleep (Aiyyo Pete Nice take em under!)
Steppin to the A.M., I'm steppin to the mic
To snatch up and smash up the club until daylight!

77,I Go To Work,Knowledge Is King,Kool Moe Dee,1989-05-12,282093,39,"

[Verse 1]
I go to work like a doctor
When I rock the mic, you got to like
The way I operate, I make miracles happen
Just from rappin', I'm so lyrically potent
And I'm flowin' and explodin'
On the scene mean, I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that are so essential
To make a rhyme send chills, then you know I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill as I build a guild
For all the rappers of skill
And kill the weak rappers with no thrills
Hang 'em in effigy
If he's a sucker, hang 'em to the left of me
'Cause my right-hand man is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own and my game plan
Is keepin' at a steady pace
Ain't no reason to rush, it ain't no race
I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
'Cause I know when to go 'head into
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya
Runnin' around, holdin' ya head
Asking your homeboy ""Yo man, you heard what he said?""
Another funky rhythm, look at your man and give him
A high five 'cause I'm live runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it, I go to work

[Hook]
I go to work
I go to work

[Verse 2]
I go to work like an architect
I build a rhyme sometimes it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter, it becomes visibly better
'Cause my foundation built a nation
Of rappers and after I came off vacation
I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone, Daddy's home
So open the door, playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
A taste of the bass and who's the ace
Start the race, I'm coming in first
With each verse, I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
And after I have ya, I have to slap ya
Senseless with endless rhymes, don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous, and when this
Rhyme is done, your mind will become
So trapped in the rap, you'll lust another one
But you gotta wait, it takes time
I don't write, I build a rhyme
Draw the plans, draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work

[Hook]
I go to work
I go to work

[Verse 3]
I go to work, like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to outfox ya
Like a punch, my rhyme rocks ya
Sometimes it knocks ya so hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks, so power packed
Before you can react, you're flat on your back
Down for the count, get up and dismount
'Cause I'm coming with an endless amount
Of rhymes in a hurry like a flurry
A collage to camouflage the power punch, but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote, I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight I wrote
Rhymes at a level, so you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent, so stay awake
Sleepwalkers, slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil's
Writing a rhyme in its highest form
And I'ma drop it on ya like a bomb
And when it explodes, I'll blow up
A few casualties, but so what?
If you're slow, you blow; you know you go
I flow I throw all-pro, I go to work

[Break]

[Verse 4]
To say rap is not work is ludicrous
Whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me, you'll compare me
To a prophet for profit, not merely
Putting words together for recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation?
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work

[Hook]

78,Cha Cha Cha,Eyes On This,MC Lyte,1989-10-03,181253,19,"

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

You can cha-cha-cha to this Mardis Gras
I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far
And I do get better, the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt (as long as you let her)
Do my thing with an '89 swing
The dopeness I write, I guarantee delight
To the hip-hop maniac, the Uptown brainiac
In full effect, MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition, you'll find them in the hospital
Visiting time, I think it's on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And I'll blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and I'll lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on...

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

I've got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme
But I'll let you slide cuz you accidently hopped on the wrong side
Now come on, that's suicide
Hypothetically speaking
Ok, let's say you didn't know what you were doing
You're new in town, and you're looking around
For another name to ruin, and it's me that you're pursuing?
Well well well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital L-Y-T-E
And it's shocking I'm the one you're mocking
Oh yes, I've been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not
So you better start living with what you got

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

Yeah, DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And you're the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the non-believer
That I'm a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So don't ever second guess me
And if you're wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And I'll bet that I did it
My fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light? It'll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night

[Kick this tip...
Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

* versions on ""Greatest Hits"" differ from the original recordings

[P] Uhh, yeah, knahmean?
Just kick back in the studio with my man E-Double, ?
[E] Yeah yeah
[P] Just thinkin' back to yo how large we'd be, knahmean?
Yeah, to them cats out there hustlin' them demos
Keep the faith, keep hustlin', knahmean E?
[E] Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
[P] I'mma lace em like this, check it

[Verse 1]
I was coolin' in my car one day you see
Clockin' a double nickel on the L-I E
When it dawned on us that it was, ten o'clock
Turned on the tunes to hear the DJ rock
The hands got to clappin', the fingers start to snappin'
E now was coolin', Brooklyn spirits we was snappin'
Comin' in and out of fantasies on how large we can get
Coolin' in rocks and Benzes with the ground effect kits
I wanted black, E was on the two-tone
Stupid boomin' system with the hand-free phone
The dream gets better and I would like to go on
But I was brought back to reality by a toot of a horn
Smoke everywhere, oh just what we needed
A meeting at twelve, and the car overheated
Feelin' real low, low enough to die
Holdin' up traffic, on the FDR drive
We had to play ourselves, in the fresh dipped gear
E Double had to push while MD steered
There went our dreams, to cool with golden limos
And alls we kept sayin' was please listen to my demo
(listen to my demo)

Please listen to my demo (3X)
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo

[Verse 2]
In the year eighty-seven when we first took off
Then I jumped on P-6-8 and broke North
Walked the big city streets of Manhattan
Buildings, the whole nine yards, so enchantin'
Thinkin' if we got a chance, we could rock it
Funky fresh demo tape in my pocket
We was walkin', and got dissed twice today
Then we stopped at 1974 Broadway
We walked in with grins on our chins
And P had juice with Mr. Virgil Simms
He played the tape and we started to laugh
Played it for Will Soc' and the Sleeping Bag staff
People start to smile, inside we buckwhylin'
Sayin' this all started back from freestylin'
They liked it, and they was very kind
But me and P was like, ""Yo G, where do we sign?""
Went in the backroom, things was lovey-dovey
Met Ron Resnick, and his partner Juggy
Things was cool, as I remembered
We signed the dotted line, now we Fresh Record members
Had dreams, of fancy cars and limos
And I wanted was somebody, to listen to my demo

Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo
Please listen to my demo
Please-please-please-ple-please listen to my demo
Listen to my demo

[Verse 1]
(Hey) Hey ladies in the place, I'm callin' out to ya
There never was a city kid truer and bluer
There's more to me than you'll ever know
And I got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
Tom Thumb, Tom Cushman, or Tom Foolery
Date women on TV with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words flowin' out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out lookin' for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on the bib
Wheelin' and dealin', I make a little bit of a stealin'
I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peelin'
Your body's on time and your mind is appealin'
Starin' at the cracks up there up on the ceilin'
Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwin'
I'm talking to a girl, telling her I'm all-knowing
Well, she's talking to the kid (""Who?"" to the kid)
I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, get funky
All the ladies in the house
The ladies, the ladies

[Verse 2]
Well, me in the corner with a good-lookin' daughter
I dropped my drawers and said, ""Welcome back Kotter""
We was cuttin' up the rug, she started cuttin' up the carpet
In my apartment, I begged her please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothin' but a crab
Educated: no, stupid: yep
And when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh
I'm not James At 15 or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam, and I'm adamant about livin' large
With the white Sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville
I met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie, but I kicked her in the booty
Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listenin' to my records', a number one sound
Step, step to the rhythm, step, step to the rhyme
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside
Tune in, turn on, to my tune that's live
Ladies flock like bees to a hive

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, get funky
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
Girls, girls
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
One more time, ain't it funky now
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
Ain't it funky now (You know that)

[Verse 3]
She's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore
She'll show you a good time, then she'll show you the door
Break up with your girl, it ended in tears
Vincent van Gogh, go and mail that ear
I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'
The phone booth on the corner is damp, and it's stinkin'
She said come on over, it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window 'cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you, and you went insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train
Well, take my advice at any price
A gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man
Suckin' down pints 'til I didn't know
Woke up in the morning with the Won Ton Ho
'Cause I announce, I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls, and big long locks
And beatnik chicks, just wearing their smocks
Walkin' high and mighty like she's number one
She thinks she's the passionate one

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, get funky
What's that?
Good god
Good god, dance
Good god
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Ain't it funky, brother?
He, ha, ha, ha
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ladies
Hey, hey, ladies

[Verse 1]
I profess and I don't jest, 'cause the words I manifest
They will take you, sedate you, and I will stress
Upon you the need for, you are to feed your
Minds and souls, so you can lead yourselves to peace
I got a real objective here
I am effective here 'cause I select a clear
Method for all, suckers I maul, they fall and scrawl
Into the pit of purgatory
I go for glory, I'm takin' inventory
Countin' all the tough luck ducks while I narrate
Relate and equate, dictate and debate
'Cause my fate is to be cold makin' history
I use sincerity, but still I bury the
Doubts and questions of all the skeptics
I'm kickin' clout and I'll even bet this is true
There's nothing so-so 'cause I know
Right about this minute, I'm in it, admit it I did it to you
'Cause this is what I'm into
So, chill while I instill that we all must fulfill
The proper mission for us and yo, this is a must
To these lines of my rhymes I attest
These are the words that I manifest, I manifest

[Verse 2]
I suggest you take a breath, for the words I manifest
They will scold you and mold you, while I impress
Upon you the fact that, I use my tact at
Rhymin', cold climbin', and chill while I attract that
Girl you're with, I got a sincere quality
I give her all of me 'cause you're too small to be
Tryin' to riff, so let me uplift and shift my gift
Let's go to the fullest capacity
I got tenacity because I have to be
The brother who must live and give with much insight
Foresight to ignite, excite and delight
And you might gain from it or feel pain from it
Because I'm ultimate, and I'm about to let off
Knowledge, wisdom, understanding
Truth with couth, so won't you throw a hand
In the air, put up a peace sign and please find
That though we're feelin' good, we should, we could, we would
Stop! Think for a moment, okay?
And then sway while I convey that we must do away
With all the stress and the strife, God bless your life
Use kindness and never blindness
And you will find this perspective is best, check it out
These are the words that I manifest, I manifest

[Verse 3]
I convey that what I say will awaken you today
I be jockin' while I'm talkin', but any way
That you put it, I'll give you lyrics to live to
Righteousness rules, so I forgive you
This time for you are bein' very ignorant
That's insignificant, I guess you figured and
Hoped to be dope as me, I glee, you flee
Because the pressure's too much for you
I'm your professor, I got the touch to
Do more than the rest who fess and can't compete
I'm elite, I'll defeat, delete and mistreat
Make mincemeat of other fools 'cause I'm the brother who'll
Snatch up the funds and make lonely ones
I meant it really 'cause I'm clearly obsessed and uh..
These are the words that I manifest, I manifest

Ladies and gentlemen
Let's make it funky
Ladies and gentlemen (Funky)
Let's make it funky

[Verse 1: Greg Nice]
Hey yo
Dizzy Gillespie plays a sax
Me, myself, I love to max
Redbone booties I'm out to wax
Stick up kids is out to tax
Spring again, and I'm feelin' fine
Pass me an ice-cold glass of wine
So I can get mellow
Lay back, and let my girl play the cello
Hello
I hate Jell-O
Let me be me, relax in my tipi
Watch a hardy boy mystery
Greg N-i-c-e
I'm nitro
And I'm hype, so
Don't ever believe
That you can deceive me
See many visions of love and splendor
I'm the real thing, not like a pretender
I rock rhymes over beats on the real tip
Stay real strong and hang on like a vise grip
Use my mind to control all my body parts
Got an early start, plus I'm very smart
Type of man that the girls wanna read about
Indeed I proceed to rock the house without a doubt
Steppin' up next, no further ado
Smooth B is gonna make it real funky for you

[Refrain: Pure Blend]
Funky for you, funky for you
Funky for you, funky for you
I'm gonna make it real funky for you (Funky for you, funky for you)
I'm gonna make it real funky for you
I'm gonna make it real funky for you
I'm gonna make it real funky for you

[Verse 2: Smooth B]
Smooth B, notorious, glorious
Knowledge is infinite, I live in a fortress
I'm so astronomical, yet on a physical plane
My body's just a shell, in control is my brain
I strain to gain spirituality
So I can finally be in unity (Funky)
Harmony with the all eye-seeing
Supreme being
Knower of histories and mysteries
I'm mystic, also stylistic
Not materialistic, simplistic (Funky)
Humble while others tumble, stumble
Smooth B, not Bumble
Rumble, no, that's not likely (Funky)
That's in my old 'school daze' like Spike Lee
Smooth B, my rhymes get better with time
I should get an endorsement for creating fresh lines
And as I grow older, lyrics get hyper (Funky)
'Cause I'm a dominant black pied piper
Spreadin' peace and love throughout my travels
And take time to read and unravel
Day to day problems, and then solve them (Funky)
I can see clearly now as I revolve
Around suckers who perpetrate heroes
But I'm no sandwich
More like a manwich
Or maybe like a meal
Which is much more real
Than Clark Kent or the Man of Steel (Funky)
Teddy Tedd, a hip-hop ambassador
Keepin' you on the floor, givin' you more and more
His cuts exquisite, what is it? A blizzard (Funky)
The musical wizard you should come visit
The man in the back, without further ado
Teddy Tedd is gonna make it real funky for you

[Refrain: Pure Blend]
Funky for you, funky for you
Funky for you, funky for you
Funky for you, funky for you
Funky for you, funky for you (Funky)

I'm gonna make it real funky for you (Funky)
I'm gonna make it real funky for you
I'm gonna make it real funky for you
I'm gonna make it real funky for you
I'm gonna make it real funky for you (Funky)
I'm gonna make it real funky for you
Let's make it funky
I'm gonna make it real funky for you (Let's make it funky)
I'm gonna make it real funky for you (Let's make it funky)
I'm gonna make it real funky for you (Funky)
I'm gonna make it real funky for you

84,I Got It Made,Youngest in Charge,Special Ed,1989-05-29,221986,46,"

[Verse 1]
I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican, but I'm speaking so that you know
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing
So listen to the lesson I preach
I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem
Full of knowledge from my toes to the top of my dome
I'm kinda young--but my tongue speaks maturity
I'm not a child, I don't need nothing for security
I get paid when my record is played
To put it short, I got it made

[Verse 2]
I'm outspoken: my language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I play it cool--cause cooling is all that I'm about
Just fooling with the girlies, yes I'm busting it out
I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use
I'm creatively superior, yo--I never lose
I never lost cause I'm the boss
I never will cause I'm still
The champion, chief one, won't lose until I choose
Which I won't cause I don't retreat
I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street
You're inviting me, a titan to a battle--why?
I don't need your respect cause I-- got it made

[Verse 3]
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin'
Make a million dollars every record that I cut and--
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Every other month I get a brand new car
Got 20, that's plenty yet I still want more
Kind of fond of Honda scooters--got 74
I got the riches--to fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies
Even got a little island of my very own--
I gotta frog--a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Got a treaty with Tahiti cause I own a percent
Got gear I wear for everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent
So it really doesn't matter--how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes--daily
You burn me--really?
Think, just blink and I've made--a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked-- a million times
Damn I'd be paid--
I got it made

[Verse 4]
I'm kinda spoiled 'cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear--got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted leg--I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growing too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
When the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me, I got the army brigade
I'm not a trader, if what you got is greater I'll trade
But maybe later cause my waiter made potato and alligator soufflé
I got it made

85,Big Ole Butt,Walking With A Panther,LL Cool J,1989-06-09,274760,28,"

[Verse 1]
I was at the mall, sipping on a milkshake
Playing the wall, taking a break
Admiring the girls with the bamboo earrings
Baby hair and body's built to swing
That's when I seen her, her name was Tina
Grace and poise kinda like a ballerina
I said how you doing, my name's Big L
Don't ask me how I'm living, cause yo, I'm living swell
But then again I'm living kind of foul
Cause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl
To make a long story short, I got the digits
Called her on my car phone and paid her a visit
I was spanking her and thanking her, chewin' her and doin' her
Laughin' because my girl didn’t know that I was screwin' her
Laying like a king on sheets of satin
That's what time it is, you know what's happening
She had a big ole booty, I was doing my duty
I mean yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie
But Tina was exotic, Earl's my witness
With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business
When I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek
But in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak
I sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in
And said to her with a devilish grin

[Hook]
Tina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you
Tina got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Tina got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you

[Verse 2]
I went to the high school about three o'clock
To try to catch a cutie riding my jock
My homeboy's jeep, the system blasting
Cold forty dogs, smiling and laughing
Girls all over, the kind I adore
I felt like a kid in a candy store
That's when I seen her, her name was Brenda
She had the kind of booty that I'd always remember
I said to my man, stop the jeep
She's only seventeen but yo don't sleep
I kicked the bass like an NFL punter
And scoped the booty like a big game hunter
I said to the girl, yo, you look tired
Let's go get some rest, relax by the fire
I put the big booty on a bearskin rug
She gave me a kiss, I gave her a hug
I said to the girl, them young boys ain't nothing
You want to get freaky, let me kiss your belly button
I circled it and teased it and made her squeal
Grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel
When I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes
When to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies
Tina busted in my house while I was eating
You know what I said
Too bad you caught me cheating but

[Hook]
Brenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you
Brenda got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Brenda got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you

[Verse 3]
I went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak
Around the time when the waitresses are on their lunch break
I pulled in the parking lot and parked my car
Somebody shouted out, I don't care who you are
I paid it no attention, I walked inside
Because Brian had a nine and he was chilling in the ride
I walked in the place, everybody was looking
And shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cooking
I sat down to eat, ordered my food
I said to the waitress, I don't mean to be rude
But I'll take you on a platter
She said you got a girl, I said it don't matter
You look like you're tastier than a piping hot pizza
What's your name, she said my tag says Lisa
I said, O.K., you're smart and all that
But when you get off work, yo, I'll be back
She looked at me and said make yourself clear
L where we going, I said right here
She looked kind of puzzled, I said you'll see
I pulled up at ten on the D-O-T
When she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
Laid her on the table and placed my order
And gave her a tip much bigger than a quarter
On and on to the break'a dawn
All over the restaurant, word is bond
I heard somebody coughing, I checked my watch
I couldn't believe it said nine o'clock
I grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol
Who did I see, oh yo it was Brenda
Yo she worked at Red Lobster but I didn't remember

[Hook]
Lisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you - see ya
Lisa got a big ole butt, I know I told you I'd be true
But Lisa got a big ole butt, so I'm leaving you - see ya

86,My Hooptie,Seminar,Sir Mix-A-Lot,1989-01-01,286000,39,"

[Verse 1]
My hooptie rollin', tailpipe draggin'
Heat don't work and my girl keeps naggin'
Six-nine Buick, deuce keeps rollin'
One hubcap 'cause three got stolen
Bumper shook loose, chrome keeps scrapin'
Mismatched tires and my whitewalls flakin'
Hit Mickey-Ds, Maharaji starts to bug
He ate a Quarter Pounder, threw the pickles on my rug
Runnin', movin', tabs expired
Girlies try to diss and say my car looks tired
Hit my brakes, out slid Skittles
Tinted back window with a bubble in the middle
Who's car is it? Posse won't say
We all play it off when you look our way
Rollin' four deep, tires smoke up the block
Gotta roll this bucket 'cause my Benz is in the shop

[Chorus]
My hooptie (I drive a bucket), hardcore tint (Yo)
I drive a bucket (Hardcore tint), yo
My hooptie (I drive a bucket), hardcore tint (Yo)
I drive a bucket (Hardcore tint), yo

[Verse 2]
Four-door nightmare, trunk lock stuck
Big dice on the mirror, grill like a truck
Lifters tickin', accelerator's stickin'
Somethin' on my left-front wheel keeps clickin'
Picked up the girlies, now we're eight-deep
Car's barely movin', but now we got heat
Made a left turn as I watched in fright
My ex-girlfriend shot out my headlight
She was standin' in the road so I smashed her toes
Mashed my pedal, boom, down she goes
Boy, I ain't lyin', long hair's flyin'
We flipped the skeez off, dumb girl starts cryin'
Baby called the cops, now I'm gettin' nervous
The cops see a beeper and the suckers might serve us
Hit a side street and what did we find?
Some young punk droppin' me a flip off sign
Put the deuce in reverse and started to curse
Another sucker on the south side about to get hurt
Homey got scared so I got on
Yeah, my group got paid, but my group's still strong
Posse moved north, headin' for the CD
Ridin' real fast so the cops don't see me
Mismatched tires got my boys uptight
Two Vogues on the left, Uniroyal on the right
Hooptie bouncin', runnin' on leaded
This is what I sport when you call me big-headed
A pothole crusher, red light rusher
Musher of a brother 'cause I'm plowin' over suckers in a hooptie

[Verse 3]
It's a three-ton monster, econobox stomper
Snatch your girly, if you don't I'll romp her
Dinosaur rush, lookin' like Shaft
Some get bold, but some get smashed
Cops say the car smokes, but I won't listen
It's a six-nine deuce, so the hell with emissions
Rollin' in Tacoma I could get burned
Better make a U-turn
Spotted this freak with immense posterior
Tryin' to roll smooth through the Hilltop area
Brothers start lettin' off, kickin' that racket
Thinkin' I'm a rock star slangin' them packets
I ain't with that, so I smooth eject
Hit I-5 with the dope cassette
Playin' that Tuff Crew hardcore dope
The tape deck broke
Damn, what's next? Brothers in Gore-Tex
Tryin' to find a spot where we could hunt for sex
Found a little club called the N-C-O
Military, competition, you know
I ain't really phased 'cause I pop much game
Rolled up tough 'cause I got much fame
""How ya doin', baby? My name is Mix-a-Lot""
""Mix-a-Lot got a Benz, boy, quit smokin' that rock"" (Ooh)
I got dissed, but it ain't no thang
Runnin' that game with the homemade slang
Baby got ished, Bremelo gip
Keep laughin' at the car and you might get clipped by a hooptie

[Chorus]
Roll— Roll— Roll— Roll— Roll— Roll— Roll— Roll—
Rollin' with your posse is the only way to go
Roll— Roll— Roll— Roll— Roll— Roll—
Rollin' with your posse is the only way to go

[Verse 4]
Runnin' outta gas, stuck in traffic
Far left lane, throwin' up much static
Input, output, carburetor full of soot
""What you want me to do, Mix?"" Push, freak, push
Sputter, sputter rollin' over gutters
Cars dip low with hardcore brothers
Tank on E, pulled into Arco
Cops on tip for Columbian cargo
We fit a stereotype, that's what he said
Big long car, four big black heads
Cops keep jockin', grabbin' like 'gators
'Bout stereotypes, I'm lookin' nothin' like Noriega
Cop took my wallet, looked at my license
His partner said ""Damn, they all look like Tyson""
Yes, I'm legit, so they gotta let me go
This bucket ain't rollin' in snow, it's my hooptie

It's my hooptie

[E] How bout the crab MC's out there?
[P] No doubt
[E] Tried to mess with The Squadron
[P] Straight up
[E] Knowin they ain't got no wins
[P] Nut-ting, nut-ting

[Erick Sermon]
Open Sesame, and let down the main gate
Before you scream EPMD, you should wait
I roll with a posse, can you try to stop me
Also yo, your brothers tried to pop me
On the sneak tip, without me knowin
So I keep goin, and my rhymes keep flowin
On and on, and I don't quit
I get pushed to the limit, and yo that's it
Step by step, I put an end to your fun
Cause I'm the chosen one, yes me my son
A young kid from the ghetto, a kiddie from the city
I don't feel sorrow, and I have no pity
To run up on you, and wax plus tax
Your gold, your money, and from your eyes your contacts
Then flex over, a hop skip and a jump
To the next town, to go punk a chump
MC's try to diss me, and try to bust caps
I'm not havin it, and that means no haps Jack
So get the bozack, and lay off the crack, cause that's wack
This is the big payback

(""Big payback"")

[Parrish Smith]
As I go and flow, to a different type of tempo
(Why MD?) C'mon E, cause P keep it simple
Plus I'm strikin like lightnin, throwin blows like Tyson
Slayin MC's on the Q-T, sorta like a sniper
So if a sucker don't like me, the feelin is mutual
I tune my rhyme to a low RPM, then shift to neutral
And crack a 40 (what kind) of Olde E
To slay an MC (how) on the Q-T
(So what's your name boy?) C'mon E, you know it's M.D
Now while I'm wreckin he's checkin, all the bodies that's left and
A pile behind the stage, the P is like steppin
Off from the scenes, I see lights and si-rens
Witness everywhere, but no one seen a thing
When cops ask questions, my description is vague
No answers at all, just bodies behind the stage
One witness yells out, that he was dressed in black
Stupid dookie link, with a Fisherman hat
When five-ohs ask how he fleed from the spot?
""In a black sports car, I think it was an Iroc
But the windows were tinted, and we couldn't get a look""
(Why?) There was smoke from the rubber he cooked
The big payback

..

[Erick Sermon]
No Rome-et-oh, or Juliette romance story
Just EPMD, the fame and the glory
The rappin technique, somethin like fencin
Dangerous, it keep you in suspense
And you have to be cool, and plus have stamina
Cause if you don't, I'm gonna end up stabbin ya
In your guts, from the razor cuts
And I'mma stick and pick, until your mind goes nuts
It might sound gross, or make your stomach bubble
But don't ever ever ever, mess with E Double
I'm like Jumpin Jack Flash, a Spy with an Eye
I do no stunts, and I'm not The Fall Guy
I'm just the E, the R-I-C-K, that's all
Say some check one-twos, and some yes yes y'alls
I'm the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour
(So what you sayin E?) I got ""Soul power!""
So dig it, as I kick it, keep your eyes open
Cause a brother like me, is always scopin
In fact, you should pack, because I cut no slack
It's like that.. this is the big payback

..

[Parrish Smith]
If rappin was a tribe I'd be the chief commanche
Hat, fat link, chunky rings, nothing fancy
So saddle up MC's, and off we go
It's not a rodeo, but I carry a lasso
Cause I'm back from vacation, cause sucker kept slippin
Rappin off-beat, plus they tune wasn't hittin
Don't wanna claim a style on the M-I-C
But I can go state to state, cold rippin shows with E
Cause whether maxin or relaxin, waxin or taxin
Never step to a show without packin
My partners, Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson
So nothin moves funny, at the rappin session
I'm Strictly Biz and knuckles, no time for laugh or chuckles
I drop clear lyrics, while your bass sound muffled
(You sniff blow?) Hell no, and still flow and say dough
More or less do a show.. nahhh
The only high I get, is when my fans yell HOE
So get the bo-zack, cause we're back to hack
Here to let you know that it's the big payback

'Cause I'm the high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter
The high plains drifter, and I'm the drifter
They can’t catch me, they’re never going to find me
They're never gonna know that I'm the high plains drifter
Pulled over to the river, to take a rest
Pulled out a pair of pliers, pulled a bullet out of my chest
Fear and loathing 'cross the country, listenin' to my 8-track
I reached behind the seat and snatched a Kool from the pack
I'm long-distance from my girl, and I'm talking on the cellular
She said that she was sorry and I said, ""yeah, the hell you were""
Check the rear view mirror, check the gold tooth display
Check the odometer, and I was on my way

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm the high plains drifter, the best that you can get
A strapped shoplifter, a pirate on cassette
Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed
Don't step to me 'cause you could be getting mushed
I'm doing 120 plowing over mailboxes
Radar detector to tell me where the cops is
Spend another night at the Motel 6
It's five dollars extra to get the porno flicks
And then I concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter
I'm a kleptomaniac K-mart shoplifter
Cash flow getting low, so I had to pull a job
I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob
I left my car outside and the engine still revving
Takin' care of business at 7-Eleven
And then I went inside to make my withdrawal
I saw what he had had, but I had to take it all
Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me off the price
So I clocked him on the turban with a bag of ice
Cause I'm mo-lello like yo-lello, cool like lemonade
I made my getaway, and then I thought that I had it made
I feel like Steve McQueen, a former movie star
Looked in the rear view mirror, seen the police car
Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap
I couldn't help to notice I was caught in a speed trap
Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, on the run from Dirty Harry
Stash the cash in the dash, but my gun I did carry
I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
I got my alibi straight, and I pulled over to the right
The cop knocked on my window and said, ""Boy, where's the fire?""
""You got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire""
""Outta the car, longhair!"" ""Your goose is cooked""
Read me my rights, fingerprinted and booked

[Verse 3]
Making like a DT, driving a Gran Fury
Wherever I hang my hat's my home, and my past is kind of blurry
Every dog will have his day, mine will be in front of a jury
High plains drifter, you know that I'm never in a hurry
Read me my rights as if I didn't know this
Threw me in the tank with a drunk called Otis
With his 5 o'clock shadow he smelled of 3-day old beer
My man turned to me and said, ""Why are you here?""
I said, ""I'm charming, I'm dashing, I'm rental-car bashing
I'm phony-paper passing at Nix Check Cashing""
I went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn house of D
He said, ""You behave, or we'll throw away the key""
Houdini'd out the cuffs, kicked the screw in the knee
I took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to OTB
I had a good feeling, easy come, easy go
I bet on one horse to win and your mother to show
And sure enough, that nag came in
Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
And then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger
Hot-wired, hot wheeled and, ""Suzy is a headbanger""

BM = Brother Marquis
FKI = Fresh Kid Ice

Intro: (sound of woman being fucked)

Verse 1
[BM] When the party's over, we can get together
Go to my house and fuck forever
And do whatever comes to mind
Let me stick my dick in your behind
You can pour me a glass of Dom Perignon
Then suck my dick until I cum
Soft is your body, tender is your kiss
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI] No need to act stuck-up, pretty and seditty
Got a funky disposition and you think you're witty
You're not used to people saying things like this
It's called criticism, and not a diss
I only give compliments when they are due
Now I'm gonna tell you all the truth
You claim to be a virgin, I mean the purest
I'll be gentle, baby, cause we can do this!

Verse 2
[BM] Love is the key to end all your woes
You'll be my bitch, not a dirty ho
Together as one we will be
I'll be fucking you and you'll be sucking me
Then lick my ass up and down
Lick it 'till your tongue turns doo-doo brown
Don't try to be slick and give me a kiss
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI] Bitch, it's time to spend the night
Let's walk the beach in the moonlight
Holding each other like lovers do
When the pussy's wet, I'll know what to do
Makin' love, holdin' you near
Screams and moans is all I hear
Quick is your tongue, soft is your lips
Suck it, bitch, cause you can do this!

Verse 3
[BM] Let's get it goin' on, let's act a fool
Listen and learn while I take you to school
You say you don't fuck on the first date?
Then fuck you, bitch! I ain't gonna wait
Cause my dick is hard and my back is strong
I'll find another bitch to get it on
Cause now is the time so stop the bullshit
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI] As you move your body, the shit you say
Will make any man want to stay
Cause being with you is all I ask
And fucking you will be my task
My lonely nights will be filled with fun
No more clubs and sex on the run
Just suck this dick, while here I lay
You can do this, so c'mon, babe!

(Mixx cuts ""Fuck me, bitch!"")

Verse 4
[BM] Bitch, you say you's gonna give me some
Now you wanna start acting dumb
You wanna play cat and mouse
When I catch you, I'mma stick my dick in your mouth
Now stop the teasin' and start the pleasin'
Just fuck me good until I skeet
Bitch, stop fakin', you need to quit it
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI] Step to me and fall to your knees
Suck this dick, put me at ease
Do something special you know I like
Smokin' head and please don't bite
Slow and easy I pull the seat back
Pumpin' down, as I climax
Steady in motion, I quietly say
We can do this, so suck it, babe!

Woman's voice:
""I think that type of sexual activity is disgusting!""

Ain't got nobody, baby...baby

[Verse 1]
Check this out baby, tenemos tremendo lío
Last night you didn't go a la casa de tu tío
(Huh?)
Resulta ser, hey, you were at a party
Higher than the sky, emborrachada de Bacardí
(No, I wasn't)
I bet you didn't know que conocí al cantinero
(What?)
He told me you were drinking and wasting my dinero
Talking about come and enjoy what a woman gives an hombre
(But first of all, see, I have to know your nombre)
Now I really wanna ask ya, que si es verdad
(Would I lie?)
And please, por favor, tell me la verdad
Because I really need to know, yeah necesito entender
If you're gonna be a player, or be my mujer
‘Cause right now you're just a liar, a straight mentirosa
(Who, me?)
Today ya tell me something, y mañana es otra cosa

[Hook: Band]
Ain't got nobody, baby...baby

[Verse 2]
I remember the day que tú me decías
Time and time again que tú me querías
(I do!)
And at the time, hey, yo te creía
Porque no sabía that you were a relambía
Yo y Fulanito y Menganito, Joseito y Fernandito
Larry and Joey y then his brother Chico
(Uh-uh)
Mucho que frentera, that's a straight skeezer
Si quieres un pedacito, go her way ‘cause she's a pleaser
But I tell ya straight up porque, brother, me di de cuenta
That on Main Street her cuerpo estaba a la venta
Now get some man que quiera get some cualquiera
Hey, yo, she don't care man, she's a tremenda fiera
Yeah you're hot to trot and out to get what I got
Pero ya que te conozco, what I gots? I guess not
(¿Porque?)
‘Cause you’re just a mentirosa con tu lengua venenosa
Today you tell me something, y mañana es otra cosa

[Dialogue]
Girl, I can't believe it
You know, my mother's talking about me
M- my friends are talking about me…not me, about you!
(About me?)
You're nothing but a skeezer
(A skeezer? Don't be calling me no skeezer!)
Tú tienes mucha frentera, mami. Sí, uh-huh, la verdad
(Uh-huh, eso es lo que tu te crees)
I bet you go to church and you're scared to confess
(No, I do confess baby, I do confess)
Uh-huh, do you tell the truth, though?
(Yeah I do)
Yeah, right
(Do you?)
Yeah! You're nothing but a skeezer. You know what?
I got some other stories to say about you
It goes like this

[Verse 3]
Un día estaba en tu casa y ring there goes the phone
Recogiste y dijiste
(Call me back. I'm not alone!)
El quería tu dirección, yeah just your address
Y antes que colgaste I heard you say
(I'll wear a dress)
""¡Ay, alabao, que descarada!"" is what ran through my mind
So I say, “Let’s go out tonight."" She said
(We go out all time)
¡Alabao, man!
Ella no sabía that, yo, I knew her plan
De que iba a salir with that other man
So I told the girl in Spanish, I said ""Hey, ya me voy.""
(Pero ¿por qué?)
‘Cause you ain't treating me like I'm some sucker toy
‘Cause who needs you anyways
(I need you!)
Con tu lengua venenosa?
(No te vayas, Mellow! No te vayas! Yo te necesito!)
Today you tell me something, y mañana es otra cosa

91,The Formula,No One Can Do It Better,The D.O.C.,1989,252626,44,"

[Verse 1: The D.O.C.]
High energy flowin' with the wisdom
Sense of a rich man, knowledge and the rhythm
This is what I'm using to come up with a style
So I'll interact altogether better with the crowd
Nervous for a second then the record starts spinnin'
And I fall into the state of mind of what I'd just created
Pump it like the Dr. D into the R.E. suckers ready to leap
Up on the tip when we made it
Creative so I'll never be regarded as a regular
More than just a little bit better than my competitor
You should never underestimate the fashion
I hold for the stage whether I'm coolin' or thrashin''
Clockin' the concoction created by me
When read you read E = the D.O. to the C
Knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
Equals an artist that won't be worn, what is that Dre?

[Dr. Dre]
It's the formula

[Verse 2: The D.O.C.]
It's like a message that only I could understand
But those who want to comprehend will again
Be in the midst of the brother
Unlike another in any way
Cause Dre don't play, say what the other say
Originality is a must whenever I bust
A funky composition, it's crush and I trust that you
Know it when you hear a funky record with potential
Me gettin' hype cause Dre rockin' the instrumental
Nothing like what you've heard before and more, never less
See I don't Fess, I mean I'm like fresh if not the freshest
When I'm expressin' my thoughts on
Vinyl, you can't help but listen up and get caught on
Hooked because I cook when I pick up a pen
And begin, in the end it's dope, that's cause I want to win
Knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
Equals the DOC, what is it Dre?

[Dr. Dre]
Yo, man, that's the formula

[Verse 3: The D.O.C.]
Keepin' it dope as long as I can like imagine
Makin' each record that I do better than the last one
Take a little time, choose the topic and drop it
Release it, the science of makin' dope beats with
Rhythmic American poetry
Shipped it to stations, now many people know of me
I'm the D. into the O. and the O. into the C. and the C. into the period
Suckers are fearin' this
When heard, the dope style calculated by the great wait
And take just a second to get caught up in my record
New but not a kid to be worn
If something gettin' torn up then I'm doin' the
Tearin', not bein' torn
Shapin' up to be one for the top vocalist lyricist
And when you hear of this
You shouldn't choke on this
Knowledge and the talent makes it valid
For me to get it patented
Dre, tellin' what I'm rappin'

[Dr. Dre]
The formula

[Verse 4: The D.O.C.]
In effect and I'm smooth, that's why I'm on the incline
Suckers frontin' for nothin' cause I'm goin' to get mine
It's in the cards and I think I might have read this
So don't lie and try to front like someone said this
Most who know thoughts served by the DOC see
That it's a mission impossible, tryin' to rock me
For an arena who'd ask me to perform for her
G.O. and easily I flow and ya know usin' the formula

92,I'm That Type Of Guy,Walking With A Panther,LL Cool J,1989-06-09,316000,31,"

[Verse 1]
You're the type of guy that can't control your girl
You try to buy her love with diamonds and pearls
I'm the type of guy that shows up on the scene
And gets the seven digits, you know the routine
You're the type of guy that tells her, ""Stay inside""
While you're steady frontin in your homeboy's ride
I'm the type of guy that comes when you leave
I'm doin your girlfriend, that's somethin you can't believe
'Cause

[Chorus]
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy

[Verse 2]
You're the type of guy that gets suspicious
I'm the type of guy that says, ""The puddin' is delicious""
You're the type of guy that has no idea
That a sneaky, freaky brother's sneakin' in from the rear
I'm the type of guy to eat it when he won't
And lick you in the places that your boyfriend don't
You're the type of guy to try to call me a punk
Not knowin' that your main girl's bitin' my chunk
I'm the type of guy that loves a dedicated lady
Their boyfriends are boring, and I can drive 'em crazy
You're the type of guy to give her money to shop
She gave me a sweater. Thank you, sweetheart

[Chorus]
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy

[Verse 3]
I'm the type of guy that picks her up from work early
Takes her to breakfast, lunch, dinner, and breakfast
You're the type of guy eatin' a TV dinner
Talkin 'bout... ""Goddamn it, I'ma kill her""
I'm the type of guy to make her say, ""Why you illin', B?""
You're the type of guy to say, ""My lower back is killin' me""
Catch my drift?
You're the type of guy that likes to drink Olde English
I'm the type of guy to cold pour 'n pamper
You're the type of guy to say, ""What you talkin' 'bout?""
I'm the type of guy to leave my drawers in your hamper

[Chorus]
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy
You know what I mean?
Check it out...

[Verse 4]
T-y-p-e g-u-y
I'm that type of guy to give you a pound and wink my eye
Like a bandit, caught me redhanded, took her for granted
But when I screwed her, you couldn't understand it
Cause you're the type of guy that don't know the time
Swearin' up and down, ""That girl's all mine""
I'm the type of guy to let you keep believin' it
Go 'head to work, while I defrost it, and season it

[Chorus]
I'm that type of guy
I'm that type of guy, know what I mean
I'm that type of guy
""So ridiculous!""

[Outro]
So funny
I don't know
Come on now
Yeah
Like real cool, you know what I mean?
I like just going to your front door ringin' the bell
And just like

93,Principal's Office,Stone Cold Rhymin' (Deluxe Edition),Young MC,1989-01-01,255946,33,"

[Intro]
Now normally if I can help But I don't spend a lot of time in a principal's office
(RING!!!)
What?
9'o clock

[Verse 1]
Now as I get to school I hear the late bell ringing
Runnning through the halls, I hear the glee club singing
And as I get to the office I can hardly speak
Cause it's the third late pass that I got this week
So to my first class I run and don't walk
All I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk
And as I get to the room I hear the teacher say
""Mr. Young I'm very happy you could join us today""
I try to sit down so I can take some notes
But I can't read what the kid next to me wrote
And if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete
As I try to get up, I find this gum on my seat
So with the seat stuck to me, I raised my hand
And said, ""Excuse me but can I go to the bathroom, ma'am?""
The teacher got upset, and she screamed out ""No!
It's off the principal's office you go.""

[Verse 2]
12 o'clock comes with mass hysteria
Everybody rushes down to the cafeteria
Picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch
And as I tried the apple sauce, I heard it crunch
I'm running up the stairs with my front tooth broken
The nurse just laughed, and said you must be joking
I looked up at her with a smile on my face
No joke cause my front tooth is out of place
So I walked to school with ice on my lip
The nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip
My books are real heavy, I'm walking, I'm dragging
Ain't no school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it
Forget class, I'm a shoot some ball
With the late pass I got no trouble at all
But then the nurse walks up and says ""What do you know?
It's off to the prinicipal's office you go.""

Recess!

[Verse 3]
Passing notes is my favorite pastime
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to
To express my feelings
Give me a week B, and the girl'll be dealing
Now one young lady was looking at me
I said ""Hi my name is Marvin, known as Young MC""
But then the ball rang, and the teacher came in
And that's when the game of passing notes would begin
I wrote the first note, told her she was fine
And I hoped that the two of us could spend some time
She wrote me back and told me ""You're fine too
I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you""
So then I sat there reeling, and looking at the ceiling
Words can't express the way that I was feeling
Then I thought to myself, the sure way to get her
Is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter
When I finished the note, it was ready to pass
The teacher took it, and read it right in front of the class
She read it word by word and line by line
And everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine
Even then my girl was laughing, and it was too late
For me to write another note cause there would be no date
The teacher looked at me, and I said ""I know
It's off to the principal's office I go.""

Yo, you think this is bad, wait 'til I get my report card

[Erick Sermon]
The employees of the year, yeah, we're back to work
I took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Due to the fact they wack in their track
Have to go back and stack 'cause they lack
The ingredients EPMD and scratch for that...
*DJ Scratch cuts and scratches*
Yo, I'm the hip-hopper, plus the show shocker
Down with MD, yes, the microphone doctor
One wrecks, the other destroys
And if you think that you're ready to mess (Kill the noise)
We don't play when it's time to slay
I get a cut from my homey, yo, then I lay
Back and mack and all the rhymes I pack
And wait for a sucker to jump and then attack

[Parrish Smith]
Well, I'm known to be the master in the MC field
No respect in '87, '88, you kneel
Cause I produce and get loose, when it's time to perform
Wax a sucker like Mop & Glo (That's word bond)
Smacked a second time, but on a different assignment
And do a sucker new jack who needs a rappin' alignment
'Cause I'm the cream of the crop when it's time to do a show
Girlies on my jock for my dope intro
As I glance at E-Double, king microphone wrecker
Turn on my cordless, sayin' mic checka
To the ladies ... and all party goers
Some call me P, and others slow flower
Brothers on my jock, for the way I hold a piece of steel
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

[Erick Sermon]
Puttin' heads to bed, straight out the box
MCs are jumpin' out shoes and socks
I'm not playin', understand what I'm sayin'
Catch a sucker in my way, and I'm slayin'
Takin' no shorts, showin' vital sign
You can tell by my lines that I'm gettin' mines
In '89, because I'm fine as wine
Sit back and recline, watch the sun shine
Take a stroll, listen to rock and roll
Catch a flick at the movies, dance or bowl
What I choose I refuse to slack while I'm back
I take a chance jack, so I must attack
With knick knack paddywack so I won't lack
Oh, my style is def, and as deadly as crack

[Parrish Smith]
While I'm slayin' music's playin', a sucker is delayin'
Battle in the trenches where the funky beat playin'
'Cause with a partner like E Double don't come a dime a dozen
Not kin or blood-related, but you can call us cousins
'Cause as we climb the charts, better known as statistics
Brothers on my jock while I'm kickin' ballistics
Droppin' hits like 'I'm Housin,' 'You Gots To Chill,' and more
The proof is in the pudding (Yo, check the Billboard)
People round town talkin' this and that
Of how we sound like the R, and our music was wack
Dropped the album Strictly Business and you thought we would fold
Thirty days later, the LP went gold
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

[Erick Sermon]
Now party people it's time for the exquisite
No knock knock who that over there or who is it
It's the E-R-I-C-K, yes, the Boy Wonder
No foulups, no bleeps, no bloops or no blunders
So hot, so you can say I'm blazin'
Or Luther Vandross says, yo I am
""Sooooooo amazing, and I've been waiting""
For a sucker to attack yo me the E-Double
'Cause me and PMD is like the funky fresh couple

[Parrish Smith]
I fight fire with fire, that's why most retired
And when we needed a piss boy, you was hired
'Cause you was mesmerized, for that style that we was bringin'
In an all-out battle, P comes out swingin'
'Cause I'm just the type of brother that's out to get mines
And if the odds against me, I still drop lines
And get mines on time, that's why most resign
Sit in my La-Z-Boy chair, relax my head and recline
Sip a Pepsi or Coke, with a twist of lime
Or crack a forty-oh, and then I go for mine
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

[Intro: Too Short]
Say ho
Yeah you
Can I ask you a question?
You like to fuck?
Oh, you don’t want me to talk to you like that?
Would you like to make love?

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I saw you walking down the street, and I had to stop
Turn up the radio and drop the top
I see you look so good, and you’re so fine
Young tender, would you be mine
I get you in my car, drive you to my house
Cuz I’m a mack, I cold turn you out
I won't ask, and I sure won’t beg
Reach right over and rub your leg
I let my hand slide between your miniskirt
Slip a finger in your panties, straight go to work
What time is it? Don’t watch the clock
Lay back baby doll and I’ll rock the cock
Funky Fresh I am, and I always can, Freak Nasty
I’m the man
I take you out to the finest restaurant
Buy you any damn thing that you want
You want flowers? I’ll buy your ass a rose
But later on you’re coming off with them pantyhose
You want gold, girl what’s next
Its me and you, doing the sex
So now you know I’m just a freak
Give it up baby, I can’t wait two weeks
I want it all, Don’t say I won't
Get it girl, now I’m telling you don’t

[Verse 2: Entice and Barbie of The Danger Zone]
Nigga please, you provoke no feeling
You must of forgot, the girls of whom you're dealing
We haven't the urge, to get busy
Like those dizy lizys, who used to dance for you, your through
I can't put it more blunt, your vocab is restricted
You're addicted, to the words you inflicted
Time after time, line after line
Talking bout the bitches that are on your mind
Do they call you $hort because of your height or your width?
Diss me boy, I'll hang your balls from a cliff
Wrapped around a slinky, your a dinky
It's an easy task, to the corner cause the curb didn't want your ass
Your name is yuck mouth, you don't brush
Gotta cover your mouth like this
They call you yuck mouth
You refuse to brush, no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
Your a freak with no tale
You have no ass, class,you can't pass, your simply trash
Your a typical nigga, the kind you don't take home
This is Entyce and Barbie from the Danger Zone
Like a short dogg that carries fleas
You make my ass itch, twitch, don't you wish you could scratch it
And grab it like you want it
The name fits cause your all up on it...

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Get mad if you want, I won't front
When it's time to hump, won't be no punk
Roll your ass over and tap the butt
Too $hort baby all in them guts
I'm not your ABC, from the alphabet
Every letter I'll write'll get your pussy wet
It's just a freaky note, from me to you
At the bottom I signed it Playboy II
I'm a player, bitch, I thought you knew
Like every other nigga in my crew
I bump hoes, now it's your turn
Tell me young tender when will you learn
I cold mack like pimps you know
Won't sell you dope or sell you blow
Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch
My gold rings come from spitz
Look baby, You know what I want
Your acting like it's that time of the month
Are you bleeding, can't think about sex
Irritated by your Kotex
We don't need to kiss, we don't have to fuck
I'll pull out my dick bitch, you can suck
Now here, don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't...

[Verse 4: Entice and Barbie of The Danger Zone]
Punk I'm not a tease, I'm not a skeezer
And most definately, not a dick pleaser
You dreaming, and scheaming, and fiending for my lust
You don't have enough, for you I feel disgust
Wait, small thing I hate
For goodness sakes, if I wanted someone small I would masturbate
I'm not talking 'bout your height, weight, or what you dream
When I say too short, you know what I mean
You see, I need man, not a boy to approach me
Your lame game, really insults me
Your name is Too $hort, or shall I say too skinny
If size were money honey, you wouldn't have a penny
Little boy, your not a player
I'm your savior
To try to get at me shows audacious behavior
I've got to sit on my feet to come down to your level
Your mother should have hung you, from her umbilical cord
If she would have known your mission
Okay little boy, here's a proposition
You wanna bit of danger, Step into my zone
You call yourself a dogg, thatz how I'll send you home
With your tail between your legs, screeching and whining
Dare to say you got some? Nigga please your lying
Cause to fight the feeling, there would have to be one
And mathmatically, me plus you equals none...

[Verse 5: Rappin 4-Tay]
I am the rapper that they call 4-tay
I'm gon tell you like my homie Short Dogg would say
Hoes in the world, trying to play it sweet
Knowing damn well that they wanna freak
Some do this for maybe a week
And then it's cool to get up under the sheets
Trying to work that thang, but she said no
That's about as far as it's going to go
So I toss and turn, to make it loose
Finally she feels the act right juice
Some of you hoes say, oh that's nasty
Back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep, that's how you sleep
Undercover freak every day of the week
You see some of you freaks just need to quit it
Playing that role like you ain't with it
The rest of you freaks just won't admit it
Especially when you know just who can get it
Ain't nobody tripping cuz I know I'm right
You could be black or you could be white
For a black girl it really don't take too long
But a white girl's always tryin to turn ya on
With a little squeze, but it's just a tease
Give her some time, she'll be on her knees
Then I'll pick her up, so I can work the butt
Baby, I just wanna try to bust a nut
But don't get me wrong, cause you started it all
Coming to my house in a camisole
But when it's time for me to shove
Then you front on all that love
First you said that I deserve it
Now you fight, don't want to serve it
Gave it some time, so make up your mind
Don't fight the feeling, it's time to unwind
You was talking 'bout you gunna give my some
But I'm Rappin 4 Tay it don't make me none...

[Verse 6: Too $hort]
Yeah man, the little hoes got ill
So now it's time to get way too real
I know they never have some real dick
They need to quit talking that childish shit
You wanna rank ho
Go get your bank ho
My little dick'll have you screaming no
Because when it comes to sex, you don't know what's up
Your still playing that finger fuck
See I'm a grown man
I bust some young cock out
I like big butts, not big mouths
I know some little girls'll break you down in bed
Pull your drawers down, give you some head
But little girl, you wanna have some fun
You better go to magic mountain cuz your way too young
So at this point, I really can't say shit
Ain't dropping no lines, I'll just call you a bitch...Beyotch!!!

[Girls voice]
""Man I wish I could find me a brother with some game""

To the rescue!

Here's a little somethin' for you whacked out suckers
Rollin' twenty-third, sellin' dope to cluckers
Your bank is thick, but you got no game
Spittin' at freaks runnin' superfly slang
I'm comin' up the ave' hard as hell
In a droptop 'Vette with a greenwood tail
Girls are jockin', lookin' for a knockin'
Smart investments, keep me clockin'
You know a 'Vette only got two seats
Just enough room for a player and a freak
Rollin' in the park, 'n I seen this cutey
L.A. face, with the Oakland booty
She's on tip, but I'm playin' that role
Talkin' to the home boys, showin' my gold
Skeez on bell, Levi's swell
I'm spittin' that game, and I'm spittin' it well
Rolled up, pulled up on the girly
""Girl you wanna ride in my 'Vette?""
""Why surely!""
That's right baby, blowin' me a kiss
Thinkin' Mixalot gonna make you rich
Highside, highside, vapors that's right
Can't get play cause my games so tight
Now she's wit' it, skirts in effect
Layin' on the back-a my 'vette
I got game, I got game, You know I got game, I got game

POP THAT GAME

Bye-bye baby, Mix gotta roll
Switch to the Benz and I gotta get mo'
Hit the strip, seen this skinny
Butt shook like a 426 Hemi
Not just butt, baby hadda motor
Stacked to the max, hair to the shoulders
She's older but I can mold 'er
Dropped that game and it hit like boulders
Now she's sprung, sittin' in my Benz
Rollin' up the tint so you can't see in
Playin' this tape of old Luther stuff
""You wanna get with me, this ain't wild enough""
That's a cue, sorry Luther
Brother you can sing, but I just can't use ya
Thought she was cool, but the girl likes beat
Freak freak freak freak, baby wanna freak
Def 'n dope, ""You slangin'"" Nope
Callin' me a dealer cause I sport fat rope
Kept poppin' that game, knowin' I can get it
""Take me to the lake Mix, so we can get wit' it""
Oh no, time for the ramble, bring a jimmy hat
Cause I hate to gamble
Huffed 'n puffed 'n I just got in
Messin' up the backa my Benz
I got game girl - I got game

Two down, two to go
Can't live my night right if I don't knock four
I'm in a big 500SEL
Interior hot, with a perfume smell
Took it on home, hit the shower
'Bout to get busy in one more hour
Ducks look, but they never will find me
Hopped in my number two Benz 190
Here a skirt, there a skirt
Everywhere a skirt, skirt
Gotta have game, if you wanna get work
""Ah, you ain't nothin'""
Some suckers wanna crush me
Smooth, wit' a move, baby girl. Rush me
Here it is, from the wizard of hip-hop
A lesson in game, make the girls get hot
Picked up a girl named Mattie
Caught static from the sucker in a seven-two caddy
Mattie was hot, but her name was ""not""
I ain't worried 'bout that, I ain't tyin' no knot
Took her to the hotel, game went strong
She thought I spent bank, but I really spent coupons
But it's cool, cause my rhyme went smooth
Savin' my money, cause my mouth is a tool
Rolled up close, when I hit the spit
I ain't worried 'bout my breath, cause I brush my teeth
Popped that game, freak got weak
Hit that jackpot, swept them feet
Mattie got busy with the bedroom eyes
Layin' on the big king-sized
I got game - I got game, girl - I got game - I got game

Yeah that's right home cut, I got G A M E, snatchin' up girlies
An' rollin' up suckers, know whatta I mean

Through with Mattie that makes three
""I'm gonna miss you babe, you gonna miss me?""
Got loose cause the girl hadda big caboose
Hadda break down cause the girl had juice
""I'm gonna miss you baby""
Smooth ain't it? Girls so sprung that she almost fainted
Headin' for the crib, tired brother
Thinking I was through when I spotted me another
Baby looks good so you know what the means
Drive around the block with the gangsta lean
Open that sun roof, crank that beat
Bumpin' up the avenue, impressin' them freaks
What's up baby, rump so big? The girl's on tip like funk on pigs
Runnin that game, cause I wanna get work
Sit don't rip rap home girl shirt
Here she comes, hopped in my car
Somethin' 'bout my Benzo's star and bars
Spit, spit, runnin' that game
I'm feelin' confident about another thick dame
All of a sudden, my game got crushed
Some sucker pulled up and his ride was plush
Rolled up smooth, the girls was waitin'
5.0, 24K Daytons
Oh-oh, think quick cause my girls jumpin' on home boy's tip
Better change my game, try another lure
Cause home boy's lookin' like Al B. Sure
But it's cool, cause I whipped out bank
Big dead presidents made her think
Back in effect, situation in hand
I'm the brother that the others can't stand
An' I got game, I got game, you know I got game

And me, the capital D, the O to C
The a.k.a., the P the M the D

[Erick Sermon]
And me, the E to the D to the O
To the U to the B to the L to the E

[K-Solo]
It's time P

[Parrish Smith]
To rip the M the I to C

[Erick Sermon]
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
K-Solo (yo) I pass P the microphone

[Parrish Smith]
Nah black (why P?) to each his own
So knick knack paddy wack give the dog a bone
Aiyyo, I pass E the microphone

[Erick Sermon]
It's me, yes the MC Grand Royal
Who loves rappin, and to it I stay loyal
I can't tell, you ain't caught up in my spell
You dwell on the other crab MC's that fell
Apart from the start, that didn't know the art
Of rappin, to keep the people's hands clappin
But it's me, I know the way it should be
The flow slow, like me and PMD
And that black, will make you real fat
A real swinger, and a real cool cat
Like a jazz player, or someone on the accordion
Producing crazy hits like, if I was Barry Gordy and
Here's a tip, to show you how to rip
A crab in half, and watch his posse flip
So me, the E, I come equipped
Heavy ammunition, so I don't have to dip
So listen, to this funky fresh lesson
The way I drop it, and the way that I was flexin
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
PMD (yo) I pass Solo the microphone

[K-Solo]
Yo I pass (why Solo?) to each his own
Yo knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
Yo, I pass P the microphone

[Parrish Smith]
As I take the stage, with the fresh dipped gear
I start to show off, with throw your hands in the air
Because the older I get, the harder I kick
Usin my rap-fu style from a rap-fu flick
Of my Bic oh shit another MC's lit
Like a Jack-o-Lantern, on the Halloween tip
Cause as the bass thumps, VU meters peaks
All pens and pads are drawn, as the teacher speaks
Because a naughty rapper, tried to steal the flow
But the buck stops here, cause I'mma let you know
No swingin, or knuckles, strictly ammo
Cause as I dust bust, crush, and then rush
A sucker new jack, with no if's and's or but's
You roll with the good times, we like to roll with Rush
I drive a 'Ratti (I drives a Benz) you ride the bus
So get out the mustard, crab, because it's time to catch-up
And in the act of war, P refuse to let up
On a gonna-be, wanna-be, soon-to-be, whatever's clever
In any type of weather, cause two birds of a feather
Always flock together
So knick knack paddy wack give the dog a bone
K-Solo, I pass E the microphone

[Erick Sermon]
I pass (why E? To each his own)
So knick knack paddy wack give a dog a bone
Aiyyo, I pass Solo the microphone

[K-Solo]
Yo, my style's aggressive, like a pit bull terrier
Harder it sounds on wax, the more the merrier
Maestro though, releases beats for me
So I can rig up a hit and get paid easily
People, gather round listen to my flow
Yo, so I can prove, that I'm the true Solo
Too many suckers, have bit my name in vain
Punk rappers thought I was sleepin, but Solo came
To so many places, other rappers faces
That called theirself Solo, I made em erase it
I'm Solo, no name lender or pretender
Yo, I am the Solo the on-ly solo contender
Duck MC's, grab my name and bit it boldly
Put it behind they name and ate this up like ravioli
I heard on KISS, with Red Alert and Chuck
A rapper said he went Solo, I said, ""What the FUCK??!""
My man came over, and said, ""Yo, I thought we heard you""
Joke's on you you heard a bitin ass crew
They bit my name, I want it back, and it's a fact
Yo PMD tell em (damn you shouldn'ta did that)
Now for the record, what do I stand for
One lonely rapper on the stage, who gets one, single applause
Give me a break my brother
My name stands for Kevin Self, Organization Left Others
My name's no game for those who claim to use my name
In vain cause their name sounds plain
I remain the same, my flow of style won't change yo
The name of the game is for the real Solo to explain
I don't know was where you ran or came
I know your vein I hate your name
You're ashamed, playin the game that drove you insane
That walk around puddles, snow and the rain
With a cane, nothin to gain but shame
And my momentum of the fast flow of rhyme'll get em tamed
The pain of no fame, no title again, nobody but the real
K-S-O-L-O to blame
When I S-P-E, L-L, very W-E, L-L
People all out there can T-E-L-L
Rhymes that I got, or write will S-E-L-L
For those who don't believe me, can go to H-E-L-L
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Like a B-R-I-D, in the S-K-Y
Don't even T-O-Y to be dat's why
L-I-N-E's belong to M-I-N-E
I'm makin veche, some rappers imitate
Yo f*ck it, Solo here's to make parties sway
People, I won't take any kind of losses
Battlin rappers grabbin the mic and usin resources
Like household utensils, kitchen appliances (becoming silent and fading away)

[Intro]
You ain't got no shit for me
(Who?)

[Verse 1: Brother Marquis]
My mama and your mama was talkin' a little shit
My mama called your mama a bull-dogged ass bitch
I know your sister, and the bitch ain't shit
She slayed me and all the boys
And even sucked our dicks
Jack and Jill went up the hill to have a little fun
Jack got mad, kicked Jill in the ass
'Cause she couldn't make him cum
Mama Bear and Papa Bear went for a walk through the forest
Mama Bear asked Papa Bear could he eat her porridge
Papa Bear said ""shit bitch, you must think I'm sick
Just get down here, on your knees and suck this bear-ass dick""
Abraham Lincoln was a good old man
He hopped out the window with his dick in his hand
He said ""excuse me lady, I'm doing my duty
So pull down your pants and give me some booty""

[Sample]
This is far out

[Verse 2: Fresh Kid Ice]
There's an old lady who lives in a shoe
Got a house full of kids don't know what to do
She sucked and fucked all the niggas around
When it's time to pay rent could none be found
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
With her legs gapped open wide
Up came a spider, looked up inside her
And said ""that pussy's wide""
Little Jack Horner sat in a corner
Fuckin' this cutie pie
Stuck in his thumb, made the bitch cum
Said ""hell of a nigga am I""
Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall
'Cause a ho on the ave. was suckin' his balls
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put that fat motherfucker back together again

[Sample]
Far out
Far out

[Interlude]
Hey wait, I got one, dig this, I got one, check this out
The two dudes, dig this, the two dudes
Two dudes dressed like nuns, right

[Verse 3: Brother Marquis, Fresh Kid Ice & Luke]
Little Red Riding Hood was on her way
To grandmother's house
But before she got there she met this man
That turned her hot ass out
Rapunzel, Rapunzel let down your hair
The dog's on my ass and gettin' near
The hair came loose and fell in a lake
Bitch check the weave that's in that lake
Bitch, get that weave out!
You dirty bitch, get that weave out!
Mix say, bitch get that weave out...

[Outro]
Hey! You ruined my record, man, I just bought it!

99,Roll With The Punches,Stone Cold Rhymin' (Deluxe Edition),Young MC,1989-01-01,271920,22,"

Roll with the punches is what I tell
To people when things dont go too well
When you go for the gold and come back empty
When the ups are few and the downs are plenty
When you talk with the girl that you always desired
You busted a move but the move backfired
When life puts you in the little crunches
Dont give up, you've got to roll with the punches
Roll it baby

Work, no matter what occupation
Any time's good time for vacation
Everyday's the same you can't believe the monotony
So when the weekend comes its like you had a lobotomy
You can't do a thing without the boss start yellin'
It wouldn't be bad if his breath wasn't smellin'
A good day's work for a good day's pay
But that's before Uncle Sam takes a portion away
Now a lot of times you feel just like quittin'
But without a job you're home alone sittin'
Checkin' the want ads for jobs to fill
Watchin soaps, Geraldo and Oprah, and Phil
My advice is to roll with with it honey
And soon you'll find that you'll be in the money
Expense accounts and three martini lunches
And thats what you get when you roll with the Punches
Roll it baby

You got to roll with the punches
Roll with it
Roll it baby

Lotto, take your chance for a dollar
If I win then I'll scream and holler
High on the hog is the way to be
And it's def livin in the lap of luxury
I picked 4 numbers they were all okay
For the 5th and 6th I used my birthday
But I erased my birthday and said better yet
I'll use the birthday of a girlie that I just met
I filled out the ticket gave it a kiss for luck
Handed it to the agent with a brand new buck
Went home to watch TV on a Saturday night
4 numbers came up and they were all alrright
Now what happened next, nearly made me drop dead
It wasn't her birthday it was mine instead
I said next time I'll just play my hunches
But what the heck, I'll just roll with the punches
Roll with it

You got to go with the flow
Like this

Women, let me tell you about 'em
Can't live with them, can't live without em
The ones you like only seem to hate you
The ones you hate only seem to date you
Girls will often tell you, you come on too strong
You got to take it slow to make the love last long
But I say, the early bird catches the worm
The late bird gets the gilrie with the two dollar perm
Man, that put me in dilema
Case in point a fly girl name Gema
I met this lady at a quiet place
About 5 years ago we were face to face
I stepped up to her, tossed the first line
Like fishin' I was wishin' that the girl would be mine
I told my best jokes and she started smilin'
A voice inside said yo Young you're stylin'
But then Gema really startin actin' silly
Cuz she broke up with her boyfriend Billy
She wanted advice and she was coming to me
I said you need Dear Abby not the Young MC
Because I don't mind being a shoulder to cry on
But I need one who needs a body to lie on
'Cause nowadays I got girls by the bunches
See I got smart and just rolled with the punches
Roll it baby

You got to go with the flow
Roll it baby
Nowadays I got girls by the bunches
I got smart and just rolled with the punches

100,Freaky Tales,Born To Mack,Too $hort,1989-09-11,573066,41,"

[Chorus]
These are the tales, the freaky tales...
These are the tales that I tell so well...

[Verse 1]
I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I shook her hand
We ended up freakin' by a garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak is all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Mary
Talk about sex and the girl acts scary
I heard she was freakin' from my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece
She'll only start talking about signing a lease
I met this tender, her name was Lori
An X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was Michelle
Her booty was bigger than a tail on a whale
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than the flames in hell
I G'd this girl, her name is Tammy
I didn't wanna do it 'cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend, her name was Jane
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespan
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name's Janine
She was 32 and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy
I kick on back and I watch her mop me
Two tons of fun, big Mamma Jamma
A country-girl from Alabama
I met this freak, her name was Beth
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her trying to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Dinah
She was a built little freak from China
I said I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm having so much money that I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my house and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I'll tell you more
She was down on her knees begging to blow
She's like another freak named Renée
You get her alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
But a freak like Renée, you can have it your way...

[Chorus]
These are the tales, the freaky tales...
These are the tales that I tell so well...
These are the tales, the freaky tales...
These are the tales that I tell so well...

[Verse 2]
I met this girl, thick as hell
Only sixteen, said her name was Linell
I took her to my house, I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than a Century Safe
Let me tell you this since we're talking young
I met another girl, said her name was Yvonne
Always talking about having fun
Once again at the pad I had it going on
I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk
I'm trying to get funky like ""Female Funk""
So when you see me coming or see me going
I keep my money, let the hoes keep hoeing
I once met a hooker, she did it for free
On the Foothill bus number forty-three
All the way in the back she was working me
Had my big beatbox and I was jamming the beat
I met this freak named Antoinette
Macked on baby like an ice cold vet
Everything she had is what I get
'Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita
Baby thought that Too $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she could suck my peter
Or either go home 'cause I knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name out my telephone book
Never again took a second look
'Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept looking while I kept staring
Baby came through with my homeboy Darren
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearing
She never left, he cut out
I know you all know what I'm talking about
There's a freak named Shannon, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's getting thinner
Shannon is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's going on
She had another buddy, came by my place
Thick ass bitch, said her name was Grace
She walked in the door working lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named Belinda
The homeboys called her 'Belinda the Blender'
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl looked like Olive Oyl
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad, her blood would boil
But I wrapped her all up like aluminum foil

[Chorus]
These are the tales, the freaky tales...
These are the tales that I tell so well...
These are the tales, the freaky tales...
These are the tales that I tell so well...

[Bridge]
Sugar Delight
Friday night
It's going on
Too $hort

[Verse 3]
Three weeks ago, I met this freak
She followed me around like Mary's sheep
I hid around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Anita
Her man's in Santa Rita
I took her to my house and homeboy, I G'd her
Sent her on her way
The very next day, Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped into this girl, her name's Roshawn
We hit the motel and had it going on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Shari
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg and let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top, she was up under
The bed hit the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a date with a girl named Kitty
She was so fine with her big fat titties
All night long she was acting shitty
So I macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
There's another girl, her name is Rose
I use to ride baby like brand new Vogues
I never saw Rose wearing clothes
She's a Penthouse pet, ready to pose
I was riding down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to palm it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was Bunny
Said I'm the only man who ever called her honey
Everything I did to her was funny
I macked on Bunny and I took her money
Eight, tonight, a date, with Shirley
She was real short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirley was freaking like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my navel
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the broad up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed, then I got on
I grabbed the microphone and started singing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this, they might be freaking
But, boy, you never had that T-P-Treatment...

101,Egg Man,Paul's Boutique (20th Anniversary Remastered Edition),Beastie Boys,1989-07-25,177679,45,"

[Intro]
Ahh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I looked out the window, seen his bald head
Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Scoped him with my scopes, he had no hair
Launched that shot, and he was caught out there
Saw the convertible driving by
I loaded up the slingshot, let one fly
He went for his to find he didn't have one
Put him in check, correct, with my egg-gun
The egg, a symbol of life
I go inside your house and bust out your wife
I pulled out the jammy, he thought it was a joke
The trigger, I pulled - his face, the yolk
Reached in his pocket, took all his cash
Left my man standing with the egg mustache
Suckers, they come a dime a dozen
""When I say dozen, you know what I'm talkin' about, boy""

[Refrain]
Yeah, that's right, I'm the Egg Man
Driving around, king of the town (yeah)
Always got my windows rolled down
Ready to throw
You know, I'm the Egg Man
Once upon a time (Egg Man…)

[Verse 2]
Humpty Dumpty was a big fat egg
He was playing the wall, then he broke his leg
Tossed it out the window, three minutes hot
Hit the Rastaman, he said, (Bloodclot!)
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
I egged the chicken, and then I ate his leg
Riding the trains, in between cars
When I pull out the station, You're Gonna Get Yours
Drive-by eggings, plaguing LA
""Yo, you just got my little cousin, ese!""
Sometimes hard-boiled, sometimes runny (Ray)
Comes from a chicken, not a bunny, dummy
People laugh, it's no joke
My name's ""Yauch"" and I'm throwing the yolk
Now they got me in a cell, but I don't care
It was then that I got caught catching people out there

[Refrain]
Up on the roof, in my car, up all night
I'm going through science like Dolemite
The Mack (Who?)
I'm the Egg Man… Taxi driver?
I'm the Egg Man
Egg Man, Egg Man

[Verse 3]
We all dressed in black, we snuck up around the back
We began to attack, the eggs did crack on Haze's back
Sam I Am, down with the program
Green Eggs and Ham, Yosemite Sam
Come Halloween, you know I come strapped
I throw it at a sucker… ""k-pap""
You made the mistake and judge a man by his race
You go through life with egg on your face
Woke up in the morning, peculiar feeling
Looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling
The family, punk rocks, the businessman
I'll dog everybody with the egg in my hand
It's not like the crack that you put in a pipe
But crack on your forehead; here's a towel, now wipe

[Outro]
Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man
Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man
Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man, Egg Man...
Egg Man...
