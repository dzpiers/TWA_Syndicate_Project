19—

Sound of the funky drummer
Music hittin' your heart 'cause I know you got soul!
(Brothers and sisters!) (Hey, hey!)
Listen if you're missin', y'all, swingin'
While I'm singin' (Hey!), givin' whatcha gettin'
Knowin' what I know and while the Black band's
Sweatin' and the rhythm-rhyme rollin'!

[Verse 2: Chuck D + Flavor Flav + Chuck D & Flavor Flav]
As the rhythm's designed to bounce, what counts is that the
Rhyme's designed to fill your mind, now that you've
Realized the pride's arrived, we got to
Pump the stuff to make ya tough, from the heart
It's a start, a work of art
To revolutionize, make a change, nothin's strange
People, people! We are the same, no—
We're not the same 'cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness, we can't get
Careless! You say, ""What is this?""
My beloved, let's get down
To business, mental self-defensive fitness
Bum-rush the show!
You gotta go for what you know
To make everybody see! In order to
Fight the powers that be (""Lemme hear you say—"")

[Verse 3: Chuck D + Flavor Flav + Chuck D & Flavor Flav]
Elvis was a hero to most, but he—
Elvis was a hero to most—
Elvis was a hero to most, but he
Never meant shit to me, you see, straight out
Racist—that sucker was simple and plain
Motherfuck him and John Wayne! 'Cause I'm Black and
I'm proud, I'm ready, I'm hyped, plus I'm amped
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps
Sample a look back; you look and find nothing
But rednecks for 400 years, if you check
""Don't Worry Be Happy"" was a number-one jam
Damn, if I say it, you can slap me right here
Get it—let's get this party
Started right, right on, c'mon!
What we got to say?
Power to the people, no delay
Make everybody see, in order to
Fight the powers that be

[Chorus: Chuck D & Flavor Flav + Chuck D + Flavor Flav]
Fight the power!
Fight the power!

Fight the power!
Fight the power!
We've got to fight the powers that be

1,Can I Kick It?,People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (25th Anniversary Edition),A Tribe Called Quest,1990-04-17,251573,69,"

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove
(Can I kick it?)

[Chorus: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're the player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
(Can I kick it?)

2,Mama Said Knock You Out,Mama Said Knock You Out,LL Cool J,1990-08-27,289693,62,"

[Intro]
C'mon, man
And with the local DBC news
LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
Word (But tonight—)

[Verse 1]
Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
I'm rocking my peers, putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

[Chorus]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)

[Verse 2]
Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhammad Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
That you know I had beef with
Why do you riff with me? The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause it might go blaow
How ya like me now?
The Ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

[Chorus]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh), breakdown

[Post-Chorus]
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Yeah)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Uh)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Huh)

[Verse 3]
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio
Uh, I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane
Starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain
I maintain unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing, digging and drilling a hole
Pass the ol' gold

[Chorus]
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)

[Verse 4]
Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour, tower of power
I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you
Understand that I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
Damn
Ooh, listen to the way I slay
Your crew
Damage, uh, damage, uh
Damage, uh, damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy-soft sucka, I'll slay him
Farmers (What?) Farmers (What?)
I'm ready (We ready)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (Get down)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock hard

[Chorus]
Knock you out
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)
I'm gonna knock you out (Huh)
Mama said knock you out (Huh)

Gangster boogie, gangster boogie (Damn)
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie
Gangster boogie, gangster boogie

3,Ice Ice Baby,To The Extreme,Vanilla Ice,1990-01-01,271466,61,"

[Intro]
Yo VIP, let's kick it

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, baby
Ice, ice, baby

[Verse 1]
Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with a brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
""Will it ever stop?"" Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, huh, and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance, rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit the bullseye, the kid don't play
And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby

[Verse 2]
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burnin' them if you're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin'
In my 5.0
With the rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
“Did you stop?” No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots raged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Ice, ice, baby

[Verse 3]
Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, “Damn!”
If rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Chorus]
Ice ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Ice ice, baby
Vanilla Ice

[Outro]
Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)

[Chorus]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

[Verse 1]
My, my, my my music hits me so hard
Makes me say, ""Oh my Lord""
Thank you for blessin' me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

[Chorus]
I told you homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know (You can't touch this)
Look in my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

[Verse 2]
Fresh new kicks, and pants
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move outta yo seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on!
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

[Chorus]
Yo, I told you (Can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school's in, sucka (You can't touch this)

[Verse 3]
Give me a song, or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' 'bout the Hammer, you're talkin' 'bout a show
That's hyped, and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

[Chorus]
That's word because you know (You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Break it down!

[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Verse 4]
Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)

[Chorus]
Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know you can't (You can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down!

[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Chorus]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!

[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Verse 5]
Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doin' this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's ""Hammer!"" ""Go Hammer!"" ""MC Hammer!"" Yo Hammer!""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this

[Chorus]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yeah (You can't touch this)
I told you (Can't touch this)
Too hot (Can't touch this)
Yo, we outta here (Can't touch this)

5,Brand Nubian,One for All,Brand Nubian,1990-11-30,278760,34,"

[Produced by Brand Nubian]

[Verse 1: Lord Jamar]
Brand Nubian function
A junction of three, collaborating in a style that's like funk
To slap palms, swing arms, tap a soul
Cause no rock rolls down our hill
Yo black it's kinda ill, we don't roll no rocks we just fill
Heads with knowledge, pure foundation
Showing and proving through the manifestation
Of our name which is ""Brand Nu""
Brand Nubian and we've come to
Make the people aware that black means first
Four hundred years we've been made to feel cursed
But now, it's our time to rule
Student of the old, teacher of the new school
My inspiration is the Five Percent Nation
As I cram, education was born
Like a thorn in your side I have sworn
Never to divide with Brand Nubian

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
You have to stand as a black man, Brand Nubian
From the Sudan plus I never ran
I'm from Africa, the central region
There I grew and formed a legion of a force
See me riding on a jet black horse, at any cost
Brand Nubians will rise up and be the boss and show it
All fairness if you're black and show awareness
You can rally 'round the flag
Stand tall, or don't stand at all
You're with the three and the three won't sag to the floor
Besides the picture that I'm painting I can draw
See me work nine to five on my easel
My physical is strong and my mind is cock diesel
Brand Nubian function in conjunction with the three

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
Brand Nubian, not on a bandwagon following a fad
Making use of the knowledge that we already had
Grand Pu, here to send the mind into a frenzy
I bet I'll swing something this summer for the Benzi
Seep into the mind the brain and activate the pelvis
Keeping the blind, dumb, deaf, and blind is Elvis
Meaning old, so behold (The black, the beautiful, the bold)
Now if this falls short, I'll try harder
A wisdom to me is someone like Assata
I'd like to say peace to Bambaata
Tasah Kuma(?), Ahmed, and Kenyatta
Brothers that'll fight for the cause
And they live in the boundaries of the righteous laws
To be exact, dominant means black
But some have a hard time trying to swallow that
Now we have some that are fake
Wearing blue eyes and green eyes, come on, gimme a break
Brand Nubian here to wake up
Take off the makeup, 'cause all it'll do is cake up
Just be real that's how I feel
Brand Nubian

[Outro]
Nubian, a native or inhabitant of Nubia
Nubian, A member of one of a group of African tribes that formed a powerful empire between Egypt and Ethiopia from the 6th to 14th century
Nubian, any of several languages spoken in the central and northern Sudan
And that's why we call ourselves Brand Nubian
As the midnight oil burns, our minds turn
Make a mistake and be fake and you'll burn
We're here to teach so you'd might as well learn
That the tree has the knowledge for what you yearn
Brand Nubian

""Hey!""
""This—""
""This is a journey—""
""—jour—""
""—journey, through sound""
""Would you join me, please, in welcome-in-ing—""
""Hahahaha""

[Verse 1]
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket;
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black attack
So I sack and jack, then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never be a brother like, ""Me go solo""
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven, what I'm givin' up
X on the flex, hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Yeah, I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Checkin' some ways (Ways)
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold, never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows, huh!
'Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got, better get some
Get on up, hustler of culture
Snake bitten, been spit in the face, huh!
But the rhymes keep fittin'
Respect's been given, how's ya livin'
Now I can't protect, a paid-off defect
Check the record and reckon an intentional wreck
Played, off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws
Not my fault that they're fallin' off
Known as fair and square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin' foul
Black to the bone, my home is your home
But welcome to the Terrordome

[Interlude]
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it
Come on down, get down
Come on, you can get it, get it, get it
""Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...""

[Ad-lib: Flavor Flav]
So long now, have a good trip!
Yo, yo, who put this thing together, huh? Me!
Me, that's who!
Who I trust? Who I trust?
Me, that's who!
Yo, who you trust, man?

[Verse 2]
Subordinate terror, kickin' off an era
Cold deliverin' pain
My '98 was '87 on a record, yo
So now I go Bronco
(Oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Yo, we gotta dust these boys off!)
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother 'cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag from the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say, I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never knew or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basin'
Traits of hate, who's celebratin' with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous, bobbin' and weavin'
And let the good get even
C'mon down (C'mon!)
But welcome to the Terrordome

[Verse 3]
Caught in the race against time, the pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes while I'm bending 'em
Snakes blowing up the lines of design (Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...)
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power, cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game, a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
'Cause a black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig

[Verse 4]
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First, nothin' worse
Than a mother's pain of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example, one of many places
Greek, week-end, speech, I speak
From a lesson, learned in Virginia
I don't smile in the line of fire, I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums, even violins
Whatcha do, getcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad, I put it down on a pad, huh!
Give ya something that ya never had
Controllin', fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'
Never allowed, kickin' it loud
Droppin' a bomb, brain game, intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team, never move alone
But welcome to the Terrordome

'Cause we can get rugged, tough, hard like P
Tried to play my man, but you couldn't touch me
You faggot, no comp' rapper on a quest
To get your head flown, boy, you must be loccin' sess
'Cause many often wonder is MD paid?
You're goddamn right, punk, stay outta my way
'Cause I clock G's while you clock Z's
And I don't smoke crack, I smoke MCs
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take note
While rappers suffer from bleedin', sprains, and slit throats
'Cause my style deadly, psychopath, schizophrenic
A rapper choke like a carburetor, freeze up and panic
'Cause I clock pesos, don't sell yayo
'Nother word for cocaine, mi amigo
That's Spanish, terminology for friend
Now sit back and ride my bozack as I send
Bass funk with beats that thump
For kickers and amps cold lined up in my trunk
My system's crankin', my headlights are blinkin'
Brothers ridin' my tip, L, and at the same time thinkin', damn
How could a brother be so nice?
'Cause I'm the capital P-E twice, M-D-E twice
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight
I like to write, but then again some bite
And while you was bangin' on tables
I was bangin' Snow White, P

[Chorus]
Yeah, slow down, baby (Yeah)
Slow down, baby (Uh, yeah)
Slow down, baby
Uh, slow down, baby

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
The Ripper, the master, the overlordian
Playing MCs like an old accordion
I get the inspiration from unnecessary station
Them sayin' I was vacationin'
You can't quote with your weaker throats
Tryin' to sneak a peek at how I freak the notes
Major MCs become minor B-flats
So retire the mic, get your chains and your bats
Here's your chance to advance, get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment
You're guilty, face down on the pavement
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred
You and your squad better praise the real god
The undertaker, droppin' thunder on fakers
When it comes to lyrics, I'm as freaky as Seka
So lay the mic down slow and careful
'Cause mine is fully loaded and I got another handful
A clip to slip in and start rippin'
Divin' and dippin' and givin' punks a whippin' (Aw, shit)
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds or so
I'm down so that you clowns'll know
Me gettin' burnt or hurt won't be tolerated
I got rhymes up the, huh, forget it, I'm constipated, L

[Chorus]
Slow down, baby (Uh, yeah)
Slow down, baby (Yeah)
Slow down, baby
E Double in the house (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Erick Sermon]
When I come around, homeboy, watch your nuggets
A master on the beatdown, my style's rugged
When I attack the microphone, close the zone
Rap sees danger, can't roam
Security's packed in, wall-to-wall, can't fall
My rap tank is full, so I can't stall
My microphone is filled with premium
Any wack MC that flexes, I'm creamin' him
Not with lotion, bust the motion
Flotation when I rock on the mic, I'm like coastin'
I'm unique, fatigued
At my peak, you still seek
A style, 'cause yours extra weak
New method to rip the stage at my age
And get loose and kick like Bruce in a rage
I'm on a rampage

[Chorus]
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby

[Outro]
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby
Slow down, baby

8,The Ghetto,Short Dog's In The House,Too $hort,1990-09-11,302133,54,"

[Intro]
Talking 'bout the ghetto
Funky, funky ghetto
Trying to survive, trying to stay alive

[Chorus]
The ghetto
The ghetto
(Talking 'bout the ghetto)
The ghetto
The ghetto
(Funky, funky ghetto)

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
Even though the streets are bumpy, lights burned out
Dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouth
Old school buddies not doing it right
Every day it's the same and it's the same every night
I wouldn't shoot you, bro, but I'd shoot that fool
If he played me close and tried to test my cool
Every day I wonder just how I'll die
Only thing I know is how to survive
There's only one rule in the real world
And that's to take care of you, only you and yours
Keep dealing with the hard times day after day
Might deal me some dope but then crime don't pay
Black man trying to break into my house again
Thought he got off dope doing time in the pen
Even though my brothers do me just like that
I get a lot of love so I'm giving it back to the ghetto

[Chorus]
The ghetto
(Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
The ghetto
(Funky, funky ghetto)
The ghetto
(Trying to live our lives)
The ghetto
(Won't ya tell 'em 'bout it Too $hort)

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
So just peep the game and don't call it crap
'Cause to me, life is one hard rap
Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine
She was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed
600 million on a football team
And her baby died just like a dope fiend
The story I tell is so incomplete
Five kids in the house, no food to eat
Don't look at me and don't ask me why
Mama's next door getting high
Even though she's got five mouths to feed
She'd rather spend her money on a H-I-T
I always tell the truth about things like this
I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list
Instead of adding to the task force send some help
Waiting on him I'd better help myself
Housing Authority and the O.P.D
All these guns just to handle me in the ghetto...

[Chorus]
The ghetto
(People are dyin')
The ghetto
(Children are cryin')
The ghetto
(Don't have enough to eat)
The ghetto
(Don't even have shoes on their feet)
The ghetto

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Even though they put us down and call us animals
We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes
Drive fancy cars, make love to stars
Never really saying just who we are
We use alias names like TOO $HORT
Sell you stuff you might kill for
Young kids grow up and that's all they know
Didn't teach him in school now he's slangin' dope
Only thing he knows is how to survive
But will he kill another brother before he dies?
In the ghetto, you keep one eye open
All day long, just hoping and hoping
You can pay your bills and not drink too much
Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up
Like me, but you don't see
Ten years from now, where will you be?

[Chorus]
The ghetto
(Tryin' to get out of the ghetto)
The ghetto
(But I got no place to go)
The ghetto
(Tryin' to survive in the heart of the ghetto)
The ghetto
(Ha, 'cause that's the only place that I know)

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
So much game in a Too $hort rap
Can't be white and whites can't be black
Why you wanna act like someone else?
All you gotta do is just be yourself
We're all the same color underneath
Short Dog is in the house, you better listen to me
Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black, stand tall and hard
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent, when you put 'em in check
'Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
So if you don't listen, it's not my fault
I'll be getting paid and you'll be paying the cost
Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth
While me and my people try to get out

[Chorus]
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Funky, funky ghetto)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Tryin' to survive)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Tryin' to stay alive)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Funky, funky ghetto)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Got no place else to go)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Tryin' to stay alive)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)

9,Around The Way Girl,Mama Said Knock You Out (Deluxe Edition),LL Cool J,1990-08-27,246533,54,"

[Intro]
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
On your loving

[Verse 1]
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, it's hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She's sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey-coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one for me)
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

[Verse 2]
Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent, so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay (On your loving)
Come around my way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one for me, to the bridge)
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

[Verse 3]
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With your New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way, you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your bikin' shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee (On your loving)
I love you, you're from around the way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only— You got me sh—)
I need an around the way girl (An around the way girl)
Fine as can be (On your loving), she's all I ask
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me
I need an around the way girl (An around the way—)
Fine as can be (Way)

[Outro]
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—

10,Wake Up (Reprise in the Sunshine),One for All,Brand Nubian,1990-11-30,325533,45,"

[Intro]
Peace to the Gods, Peace Allah
A-yo, there go that brother Grand Puba
I heard that brother got knowledge of self
Yo, true indeed brother
Yo, let's have that brother come over and add on to the cipher

[Hook]
Sunshine, everybody looks for sunshine
Folks, get down in the sunshine
My life, my life, my life, my life!

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
A-yo, knowledge this
The attribute Hagi helper to another God in need
He-Allah-God-Islam
As I proceed to civilize the uncivilized
Word of wisdom to the groove from the wise (Speak on it, God)
I guess I'm like the Verbalizer for the fact I'm moving Blackwards
This Asiatic black man is a dog spelled backwards
The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization, God of the universe
Manifesting thoughts with my infinite styles
Making sure this travels twenty-three million miles
The other six I set the crucifix
Because the heart of the problem is this (Speak on it, God)
Preacher got my Old Earth putting money in a pan
For the rest of the week, now I'm eating out a soup can
He has a home, drives a Caddy through town
Has my Old Earth believing that he's coming from the ground (Jesus)
Slain are those who fought for what was right
Slayed are those who fell victim to the pipe
A drug controlled substance, contained in a vial
Set up by the devil as he looks and he smiles
Good at the game of tricknology
But I have knowledge of myself, you're not fooling me
You see, the answer to me is black unity
Unification, to help our bad situation
I wrote this on a day of Wisdom, Power
All being born to myself (God!)
I won't diss the next brother to be paid, that's not my trade
It's just the plan that is designed by the colored man
Now our babies are born to think this is the way of us (The way of us)
That's the way the devil wants it, so it is no fuss (It is no fuss)
It's just that sad old song, ""Self Destruction""
To stop our reproduction

[Refrain]
They put our Wisdom before us (Murderer!)
That makes it Wisdom, Knowledge (Murderer!)
But we need Knowledge, Wisdom to bring forth the Understanding (Murderer!)
Culture, Freedom (Murderer!)
Power, Refinement (Murderer!)
Equality, God, Build, Destroy, Borns our Cipher (Murderer!)

[Pre-Hook: Grand Pupa & Sincere]
(Can a devil fool a Muslim?) No, not nowadays, bro
(Do you mean to say the devil fooled us four hundred years ago?)
Why-Equal-Self, a trader made an interpretation
Saying that we'd receive more gold for our labor in his nation
(Did we receive more gold?) God, Now-Cipher!
It's time to drop the bomb and make the devil pay the piper
(True indeed, God, true indeed, God) Why Equal Self
(True indeed, God, true indeed, God) Why Equal Self
(True indeed, God, true indeed, God) Why Equal Self
(True indeed God, true indeed) Why Equal Self

[Hook]
Sunshine, everybody looks for sunshine
Folks, get down in the sunshine
My life, my life, my life, my life!

[Verse 2: Grand Puba]
The solution: Knowledge of self to better ourself
'Cause I know myself, that we can live much better than this
Nothing's changed, it's just another sequel
The devil's still causing trouble amongst the righteous people
Drugs in our community (That ain't right!)
Can't even get a job (That ain't right!)
Poisoning our babies (That ain't right!)
Lying who is God (That ain't right!)
Well, here's some food for thought
Many fought for the sport, and the black man still comes up short?
It's time to motivate, build and elevate
Blind, deaf, and dumb; we've gotta change their mind state
So I dip-dip-diver, civilize a 85'er
Gotta let him know the devil's a conniver
This is the plan from the brother man from the motherland
Now it's time to take a stand
I keep striving to do my duty to awake 'em
To the universal family, I say As-salamu Alaykum

[Outro]
Yeah, now I'mma do like this
Nuff respects to the brother Jazzy Jay, nuff respect
Nuff respects, to my Brand Nubian brothers
Bust it, Lord Jamar, God Allah
Derek X is on the flex
Alamo is good to go
Sincere, the God is in here
So move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
Move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
Now, before I motivate, I'mma just say like this
Please Educate Allah's children, with Equality
Move on black man, move on
You gotta move on black man, move on

11,Do You Want Me,Blacks' Magic,Salt-N-Pepa,1990-01-01,232266,34,"

Artist: Salt N Pepa
Album:  Blacks' Magic
Song:   Do You Want Me

You said it loud, and I heard you
Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby

CHORUS
Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like

Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you toleratered me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up

CHORUS

Who me?  A tease?  Brother, please
You're just having bad memories
About some skeeze who did the squeeze
And had you on your hands and knees
Look, I am telling you straight out
That's not what I'm all about
I'd just be playing myself out
If I spent the night at your house
Now don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long
But this is my life not just a song

CHORUS

12,Once Upon A Time In The Projects,AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted,Ice Cube,1990-03-16,221066,37,"

[Produced by Sir Jinx]

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door, ""Who is it?""
It's Ice Cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot
She said ""Fuck em, cause they get sparked a lot""
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
And then I put my Nike's on the coffee table
Her brother came in, he's into gang-bangin'
Cause he walked up and said ""What set you claimin'?""
I don't bang, I write the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminded me of Good Times
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
He threw up a set and then he was gone
I'm thinkin' to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on?
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
And fired up the sess, it was sess no doubt
She said, ""Please excuse my house,"" and all that
I said, ""Yeah,"" 'cause I was buzzed from the contact
Lookin' at a fucked up black and white
Her mom's bitchin' cause the county check wasn't right
She had another brother that was three years old
And had a bad case of the runny nose
He asked me who I was then I had to pause
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
I saw her sister who really needs her ass kicked
Only thirteen and already pregnant
I grabbed my forty out the bag and took a swig
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by BeBe Kids
They was runnin' and yellin' and playin' and cussin' and tellin'
And look at this young punk bailin'
I heard a knock on the door without the password
And her mom's got the twelve gauge Mossberg
The nigga said ""Yo, what's for sale?"" (Yo, what's for sale, man?)
And the bitch came out with a bag of yayo
She made the drop and got the twenty dollars
From a smoked-out fool with ring around the collar
The girl I was waiting for came out
I said, ""Bitch, I didn't know this was a crack house""
I got my coat, and suddenly

[Segue]
""Stop, the police, don't move!
Freeze! I'll kill ya!""

[Verse 2]
The cop busted in and had a Mac-10 pointed at my dome
And I said to myself, ""Once again, it's on""
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin' no slack
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
I said, ""fuck, how much abuse can a nigga take""
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case
He said, ""get out my face"" and musta had a grudge
His reply, ""Tell that bullshit to the judge""
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin'
I said ""Aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin'""
She started draggin' and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the paddy wagon
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point
I had a warrant so I spent two weeks in the joint
Now the story you heard has one little object
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects

14,Short but Funky,Short Dog's In The House,Too $hort,1990-09-11,253400,37,"

[Verse 1]
Life is too short but now it's kind of funky
I make the beats for me and my homies
Newspaper reporters and others always ask me
Why I'm X-rated and I rap so nasty
When I was a teen I did nothin' else
But pick up a pen and express myself
The things I wrote were obsene and kind of dirty
But mama always said the truth couldn't hurt me
She also said that it would set me free
I guess she was R-I-G-H-T on the nail
'Cause now I'm out making my mail
It all started out from a freaky tale
If that's what sells then I'm a stick with it
Short Dog ain't changing, so forget it
You can sell out if you want to, homie
But I'ma stay short but funky

[Chorus]
Funky, funky
Funky
Funky, funky
Funky

[Verse 2]
Don't stop, just call it verse two
It's Short Dog baby from the Dangerous Crew
Not your average everyday fake rap on the micro'
I might say something that your mother don't like so
Don't play it loud if she's around to see
But you can play this 'cause it's rated PG
When I'm rated X I'm just having my fun
I bring a smile to each and every one
But there's a serious side in everything I say
Life is too short for you to wait 'til the next day
Just straighten up your life and you can start right here
Drop the cocaine and the bottles of beer
People always say it ain't right to preach
But take my advice, get wise and reach for the sky
So you can live like a king, homie
And I'ma stay short but funky

[Chorus]
Funky, funky
Funky
Funky, funky
Funky
Funky, Funky
Funky
Funky, funky
Funky

[Verse 3]
You never catch me on the mic rappin' a dance tune
I like it kind of mellow with the sound of the bass boom
The style is mine, I've been doing it for ten
You might say it's simple, but I'm making my ends
See I don't trip on a punk 'cause I jack him
Too $hort plus the cuss words equals platinum
What would I look like dancing on a stage?
I wave my hand and do it like the old days
But some dumb fool want to take it out of hand
With 50 million dancers and a big old band
That ain't me, I'm from the old school
Play the instrumental, get the mic and I'm cool
'Cause I'm an Oaktown mack and it's like that, so
It all comes out in my records and my stage show
In my category I'm the one and only
And I'ma stay short but funky (Funky)

[Chorus]
Funky (Hey Al, that's it), funky
Funky
Funky (Baby Jesus), funky
Funky
Funky, funky
Funky
Funky, funky (Dog baby from the Dangerous Crew)
Funky

Funky, funky

Uncle L, future of the funk
Records are recorded minus all the junk
People spread gossip and believe what they must
But I slam dunk punks and make 'em bite the dust
A minute is needed to make a phony 'roni bleed
And put 'em in a bucket like it's chicken feed
Check out the pick of the litter, not a quitter, I'm nice
And I'ma dust you off and dust you off twice
Man, you never heard it so observant, hysterical fan—
'Atics of the Asiatic miracle man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel
You're so-so, I got the instinct
They call me Deputy Dawg to put your booty in the clink
You're dancin' to a Marley Marl remix single of—
Let me see your earrings jingle, love

[Chorus]
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 2]
I chopped you, chewed you, baked you and stewed you
The slop you pop, you need to stop, you're kind of rude you
No good niggaboo tryin' to base
How we livin', holmes? Get out my face
I'm complete, in effect, and I can't fall
Rise, surprise, and I advise you all
To stand back and peep, don't sleep or doubt
My skill'll get ill, I turn the mother out, huh
I'm top-notch, you're playin' hopscotch
Now I'ma do ya while the party people watch
You're real funny, you really tried to go for yours
But I know why, you ain't had no dough before
So you tried and lied to drain my fame
This ain't a game, yo, you know my name
Innovating, devastating and dope on a single, now
Dance to my remix single

[Chorus]
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 3]
When you first walked in I ain't know what to think
'Cause you grabbed the microphone like your booty don't stink
And tried to run down that, I can't get over that
Garbage you were sayin', you call that a battle rap?
How you gonna go against an army with a handgun?
I'm LL and you don't understand, son
I'm a legend, on top of that I'm livin'
Now you look booty like that bum Miss Givens
Whoever geesed you up, nah, how should I say it?
Whoever set you up, they knew just how to play it
'Cause man, yo, I feel for ya, brother
I'm a bad— (Word to the mother)
Takin' out suckers while the ladies pucker
Rollin' over punks like a redneck trucker
Innovating, devastating, and dope on a single, now
Lemme see your earrings jingle

[Chorus]
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby (Break down)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
(Jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Yeah, go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) C'mon, go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Yeah, do it, baby

[Verse 4]
Can't believe you tried to get the same mic as me
Your grip's too weak, you can't hold it, B
You can dream of makin' progress and gettin' this nice
But when I roll up, it's like Hip Hop Vice
Serve the curves, I never swerve, I'm superb
Every word you heard played tricks on your nerves
Played your hand, lost track of your plan
When I show up, I blow up, end of story, my man
Play you like a poker chip, that's what you get
I bet you fret, sweat and regret you met
The titan of fightin', excitin' when writin'
You triflin' toyboy, I gotta enlighten, so start bitin'
You know you can't create and get mean like this
When I'm on the court, G, it's strictly swish
When it's all over, said and done, my friend
They'll say, ""L.L. Cool J just scored again""
So take a step back, give me some room to wreck shop
Here's your token back, you're gettin' off at the next stop
I'ma deliver and give a speech with vigor
Pass the wine cooler you big black— (Hahaha, yeah)

[Chorus]
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Yeah, go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jinglin', baby) Yeah, go 'head, baby

[Intro]
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

[Verse 1: Sadat X]
Hey, baby, your hips was getting big
Now you're getting thin, you don't care about your wig
Now Woolie Willie got a pair of my sneakers
Wonder where he got 'em, 'cause I hid 'em behind my speakers
The object of your affection is the treetop connection
Where basically you love to smoke your wools
The crackheads and crack men they come up to my door
I don't smoke jums, so what they knocking for?
Kids love to feel on you, feds got a seal on you, street time is limited to days
On your crack card you're getting only A's and C's for come back
Damn, it's a shame you're the mighty queen of vials
With a wide-eyed look and a rotten-tooth smile
Used to walk with a swagger, now you simply stagger
From one spot, on to the next spot, on
To the next spot on to the next
Bitch, get a job, from me you won't rob
'Cause I'll smack you with a hose filled with sand
Now give that to the crack man
You was fly once, now you're losing all your fronts
Started off light, only tipping woolie blunts
But now you get a a stripe, graduated to the pipe
Took a long pull, hype
Yeah, head crack, head crack
You smoked up that stack in a minute you was back
(Ayo, X, wasn't that your girl?) Yeah, I had to drop her
'Cause she caught on the plastic and I just couldn't stop her

[Chorus]
Slow down
Slow— Slow down
S— S— Slow down (What I am is what I am)
Slow down (What I am is what I am)
Slow down

[Verse 2: Lord Jamar]
I knew this girl named Tropicana, she's always juicing
Producing cash from her sexual tasks
She loves men that trick like Halloween and treat
You ain't paid, then your grade is incomplete
You've got to flash dollars to prove her
And when you do she sucks it up like a Hoover
Taking all your papes like inhalation of vapes
Her nasal passage is filled with money, and it's massive
What I am is what I am
Well, what you are is a stunt, man, you're on a hunt
And your plan is to take all you can from a man and scram
I've seen your kind before, you're not original
Just a sick, mixed-up individual
Giving up the crotch for a fresh gold watch
Marking off the goods you get going up another notch
Your ways and actions are like those of a savage
If the price is right, then anyone can ravage
Even Monty Hall can have himself a ball if his assets are in order
What's really scary is you're somebody's daughter
So don't come around trying to make a profit
At the expense of another man, stop it
'Cause you see, you're the freak show of the town
Know what I think you ought to do is

[Chorus]
Slow down
Slow down
Slow d— Slow down
Slow down (What I am is what I am)
Slow down (What I am is what I am)
Slow— Slow down
Slow down

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
As the jewels jingle from the hot young and single little stunt
A forty and a blunt, that's all she really wants
But she'll spend your papes and she'll use up all your plastic
And if you swing an ep', you'd better wear a prophylactic
'Cause things are getting drastic
Slide up in the wrong one, you'll end up in a casket (Slow down)
Sister, there's no need in speeding
She was doing lays before she started bleedin'
What makes a bitch want to act in this fashion?
Pulled more stunts than my man Action Jackson
A real gold winner just like Bruce Jenner
Lay the bitch on the bed and then you run right in her
Puba makes no mistakes
She said, ""Rock me tonight for old time's sakes""
Picture that (Slow down), you little hooker
Honey got a problem with the bends
Meaning she likes to bend over and then she spreads the skins
The ho is just a ho and that's without the controversy
She can make the bedsprings sing a song of mercy
Come on, toots, you can take a thousand douches
Scrub that ass and I'll still pass (Slow down)
You're living foul (Slow down, slow d— slow down)
Now see it ain't no reason for you to be out here skeezing
'Cause it's not the season
So if you want to live foul and be a dum-diddly-dum-dum bitch
Well, go ahead

[Chorus: Grand Puba]
Slow— Slow down (What I am is what I am), you're livin' foul
Slow down (What I am is what I am)
Slow— Slow down (What I am is what I am)

Now I'd like to give a special shout to my DJ Alamo on the help out
Now my light's out

[Verse 1]
Driving in my car down the avenue
Towing on a j, sipping on some brew
Turned around, see the fly young lady
Pull to the curb and park my Mercedes
Said ""Fly lady, now you're looking real nice
Sweeter than honey, sugar and spice""
Told her my name was MC Schoolly D
All about making that cash money
She said, ""Schoolly D, I know your game
Heard about you in the hall of fame""
I said, ""Mama, mama, I tell you no lies
'Cause all I wanna do is to get you high
And uh - lay you down and do the body rock""
Took a walk to the corner, got into the car
Took a little trip to a fancy bar
Copped some brew, some j, some coke
Tell you now, brother, this ain't no joke
She got me to the crib, she laid me on the bed
I fucked her from my toes to the top of my head
I finally realized the girl was a whore
Gave her ten dollars, she asked me for some more

Clinton Road one Saturday night
Towing on a cheeba I was feeling alright
Then my homie-homie called me on the phone
His name is Chief Keith, but we call him Bone
Told me 'bout this party on the Southside
Copped my pistol, jumped into the ride
Got at the bar, copped some flack
Copped some cheeba-cheeba, it wasn't wack
Got to the place, and who did I see
A sucker-ass nigga trying to sound like me
Put my pistol up against his head
And said, ""You sucker-ass nigga I should shoot you dead""
A thought ran across my educated mind
Said, man, Schoolly D ain't doing no time
Grabbed the microphone and I started to talk
Sucker-ass nigga, man, he started to walk

""Somebody call an ambulance!""
""There's not a minute to spare""
""Don't worry""
""There's not a minute to spare""
""Don't worry""
Going, going, gone!

[Verse 1: Flavor Flav]
Now I dialed 911 a long time ago
Don't you see how late they're reacting?
They only come and they come when they wanna
So get the morgue truck and embalm the goner
They don't care 'cause they stay paid anyway
They treat you like an ace that can't beat a trey
A no-use number with no-use people
If your life is on the line then you're dead today
Latecomers with the late coming stretcher
That's a body bag in disguise y'all, I'll betcha
I call 'em body snatchers cause they come to fetch ya
With an autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya
They are the kings cause they swing amputation
Lose you arms or legs to their miscalculation
I can prove it to you, watch the rotation
It all adds up to a fucked up situation

[Chorus]
So get up, get, get, get down
911 is a joke in yo town
Get up, get, get, get down
Late 911 wears the late crown
So get up get, get get down
911 is a joke in yo town
Get up, get, get, get down
Late 911 wears the late crown

[Interlude]
911 is a joke
911 is a joke

[Verse 2: Flavor Flav]
Everyday they don't never come correct
You can ask my man right here with the broken neck
He's a witness to the job never being done
He would've been in full effect
But late 911 was a joke cause they only joking
They the token to your life when it's croaking
They need to be in a pawn shop on a
911 is a joke we don't want 'em
I call a cab cause a cab will come quicker
The doctors huddle up and call a flea flicker
Reason why I say that cause they flick you off like fleas
They be laughing at you while you're crawling on your knees
And to the strength so go the length
Thinkin' you are first when you really are tenth
You better wake up and smell the real flavor
Cause 911 is a fake life saver

[Hook]
So get up get, get get down
911 is a joke in yo town
Get up, get, get, get down
Late 911 wears the late crown
So get up get, get get down

Get up, get, get, get down
Late 911 wears the late crown

Ahh

So get up get, get get down

Get up, get, get, get down

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga
That's why I'm sick of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk, 'cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine-double-M
The day is coming that you'll all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about coming up
So what they do, go and ban the AK?
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way
So you better duck away, run and hide out
When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out
'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham
When I'm shooting, let's see who drop
The police, the media, and suckers that went pop?
And motherfuckers that say they too black
Put 'em overseas, they be begging to come back
And say we promote gangs and drugs
You wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
Kicking shit called street knowledge
Why more niggas in the pen than in college?
Because of that line, I might be your cellmate
That's from the nigga ya love to hate

[Hook]
(Fuck you Ice Cube!)
Yeah, haha! It’s the nigga you love to hate
(Fuck you Ice Cube!)
(Ay yo baby, your mother warned you about me)
It's the nigga you love to hate
(Yo, you ain’t doin' nothin' positive!
Yo, you ain’t doin' nothin 'positive for the brothers, what you gotta say for yourself?)
(You don't like how I'm living? Well, fuck you)

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Once again it's on, the motherfucking psycho
Ice Cube the bitch-killer, cap-peeler
Yo, running through the line like Bo, there's no pot to piss in
I put my fist in
Now, who do ya love to hate?
Cause I talk shit and down the eight-ball 'cause I don't fake
You're begging I fall off
The crossover, might as well cut them balls off
And get your ass ready for the Lenching
The Mob is dropping common sense and
We'll gank in the pen, we'll shank
Any Tom, Dick and Hank, and get the ass spanked
It ain't about how right or wrong you live, but how long you live
I ain't with the bullshit
I meet mo' bitches, mo' hoes
Don't wanna sleep, so I keep popping No-Doz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
'Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low
And if you're locked up I dedicate my stylin'
From San Quentin to Rikers Island
We got 'em afraid of the funky shit
I like to clown so pump up the sound
In your Jeep, make the old ladies say
""Oh my god — brake, it's the nigga ya love to hate""

[Hook]
(Fuck you Ice Cube)
Yeah come on fool, it’s the nigga you love to hate
(Fuck you Ice Cube)
Yeah, what up, punk? It’s the nigga you love to hate
[Yo, who the fuck you think you are callin' us bitches. You ain’t all that, all I hear is this bitch. I ain’t nobody’s bitch]
A bitch is a...ohhhh

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Soul Train done lost they soul
Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes
I see a lotta others damn
It almost look like the Bandstand
You ask me: ""did I like Arsenio?""
About as much as the Bicentennial
I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools
'Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube
And what I say, what I portray and all that
And ain't even seen the gat
I don't wanna see no dancing
I'm sick of that shit -- listen to the hit
'Cause yo if I look and see another brother
On the video trying to out-dance each other
I'ma tell T-Bone to pass the bottle
And don't give me that shit about role model
It ain't wise to chastise and preach
Just open the eyes of each
'Cause laws are made to be broken up
What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up
And build mold and fold theyself into shape
Of the nigga you love to hate

[Intro]
Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumping
Yeah, aight, but we need a beat that they can front to
Oh, that'll work, be funky, you know what I'm sayin'?
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems
Cars ride by—
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (Funky)
Cars ride by— (For all the cars out there and all the brothers)
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (That like to front in they rides)
Cars ride by— (Check it out)

[Verse 1]
You know it's funky, funky, funky 'cause you heard it from here, see
A jam that you love that don't be gettin' no airplay
Strictly for frontin' when you're ridin' around
Twelve o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights blinkin' 'cause your batteries drain
Armor All on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin' outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the EQ and play connect the dots
Leanin' to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin' with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
'Cause they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin' up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin' by
And the girls be on my jock 'cause my system's fly

[Chorus]
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (All up at dawn)
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (Just frontin')
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems

[Verse 2]
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
'Cause they be hear me gettin' funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say, ""What is this?
Mind your business""
Then pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin' my head
While I'm checkin' out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm frontin' and I don't care if you know
The back seat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne?
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise, it's three o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me comin'
I'm steady hummin', I got the ""Funky Drummer"" drummin'
My trunk be shakin', vibratin' and rattlin'
Pumpin' so loud, all the shorties be babblin'
My right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showin' off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
'Cause I'm frontin' in my ride and my word is bond

[Chorus]
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (Frontin', you know what I mean?)
Cars ride by—
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems
Cars ride by—

[Verse 3]
Sunroof open so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N
To the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N
That means I'm chillin'
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cozy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say, I want bass
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rollin' up smilin', but you can't come close
'Cause my system is pumpin' loud
Like Rakim said, I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE
Tell the cops, ""You gots to chill"" with EPMD
This is something devastatin' that'll break your trunk
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk

[Chorus]
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (Yeah, that's frontin')
Cars ride by—
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (You know what I'm sayin'?)
Cars ride by— (So next time you're in your ride pumpin' it up)
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems (Just remember)
Cars ride by— (It's cool)
Cars ride by with the boomin' systems
Cars ride by— (Peace)

It ain't no surprise
That I'm Ares

We shelby
We shall be the greatest

But im the scar who never fades

Long journey sunni hai toh yahi asli daawat hai

Dimaag mai shabdo ka chada hai nasha
Shukriya jinhone nahi diya saath dekh padayi nahi Hiphop karne mai laga
IRL Stutter kar, par beat pe karta katal hu
Mai murder karta seedha par choke kar apni mai hurdle hu

23,AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted,AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted,Ice Cube,1990-03-16,248160,46,"

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Ice Cube with Da Lench Mob, I got it goin' on
A nigga that's livin' in the city of the criminal zone
One-time can't keep the law in order
'Cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area
The way I'm talkin' I'm scarin' ya
I'm darin' ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
Or beat down for ya flag
'Cause if you is or you ain't a gangbanger
Keep one in the chamber
'Cause you'll get them thangs put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin' did my head grow?
Will the boys in the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay
I keep my nine anyway
For the day one of my homies wanna squab
I'm still rollin' wit Da Lench Mob

[Bridge]
(America's Most Wanted)

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Back in the day I did my share of dirt
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable
To bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest
I'm a menace crook
I did so much dirt, I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I repo your Vette, then jet
Back to the criminal set
I leave clue after clue, but they can't catch me yet
'Cause I'm slick and slippery
They can't get with me, cops ain't shit to me
I can't dig a pig, so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad, mad 'cause I'm the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Aiyo, here's what the poster read
""Ice Cube is wanted dead""
That's all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green
Hear shots and si-reens
When I fiend, first they yo' rings, now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
It's the American way
'Cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Ice Cube, a motherfuckin' klepto
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so
Who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap, wou know I'ma beat the wack
With a payoff, cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick, stay off!
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest
So get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight
'Cause I'm scarin' ya, wanted by America

[Interlude]
(Aiyo Cube man, they on your ass)

[Verse 4: Ice Cube]
Word, but who the fuck is Herb?
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let 'em see a nigga invasion
Point blank on a Caucasian
Cocked the hammer, didn't crack no smile
Take me to your house, pal
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin' in the den, yo it couldn't be
(What up, G?) Saw my face on TV
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Packed my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
Cos the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin' my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbing the white folks
Now I'm in the pen with the soap-on-a-rope
I said it before and I'll still taught it
Every motherfucker with a color is most wanted

[Outro]
AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, uh,  reports that Ice Cube is the leader of the, uh, Lench Mob. Uh, also in the group they have J-Dee, Chill, T-Bone, Yo-Yo, Del, K-Dee
Sounds like a black thing

24,All for One,One for All,Brand Nubian,1990-11-30,294720,37,"

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
I hit a beat and swing a note as if my name was David Ruffin
Quick to toast an MC just like an English muffin
Don't worry about a thing because the Puba's never bluffing
I gets headaches from the wack, so then I take a Bufferin and I max
I wait until the opportune time and then I tax but should I max?
Now they say sinning is for sinners so I guess I'm not a sinner
Beginning's for beginners so I guess I'm no beginner
This is how I spark it, puts money in my pocket
When it comes to having pleasure I gets hard as a rocket
MC Grand Pu coming through all the residue
The songs remain classics dating back to the Babalu
My boys I call 'em Akh, the foes I let 'em jock
And I can think of many episodes I swung in Lincoln Park
No I'm not a phony and I got a tenderoni
Love the way she is - not too fat, not too bony
Don't drink Sanka, won't sink like a tanker
Knock the boots off a skirt in Casablanca and I thank her
Some rappers stink like Engelbert Humperdinck
Better yet Dick Cavett, I got a bad habit
Similar to the girl on She's Gotta Have It
I think with the brain and not what’s behind the zipper
I'm living kinda good similar to Jack Tripper
A landlord named Roper did a show at the Copa
When I'm finished with this I'll be paid like Oprah
So if honey wants to act fly
I'll just play like Guy and I'm (saying, ""bye, bye, dumb bitch!"")
Stick out your thumb and hitch
Cause you've been cut off like a light switch
See I'm programmed to slam, winter, summer, spring or fall
Before I do a show I get some kicks out the mall
Then I get my gear and I give Trev a call
Cause he works in the barbershop, right behind the mall
Other rappers tried to rob me but you know they got did
To put it blunt, honey I shrunk the kids
So bookers back off break North here comes the regulator
Betcha that you find none greater

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
On file is a style, that's why you caught a clip
My suitcases is packed and I'm going on a trip
To Mic-a-delphia I go for self and still be slamming
The school bell is ringing and I caught somebody cramming
For the test, oh yes, my study guide was thick
I cut you with my verbal, didn't hurt you just a nick
Off your face, don't play possum watch me and I'll blossom
Like a rose and get some new clothes
And a fresh fade from Rob
Jamar on the phone and now the Now Rule Mob
The come one, come all, we about to get hectic
If my crew don't get in, then the X makes a exit
To the rear, I'm outta here, don't front on my brothers
I take care of them before I take care of others
The wood bats is doomed, in the 90's it's aluminum
Step to the stage with a mic and I'm doing 'em something awful
I'm a citizen and I'm lawful
I go to Hunter in the fall, rip the policemen's ball
I got the power to make a car stall
I get some drinks from Glackens, and when the crowd slackens
I stop drinking and then I start thinking about
Days in the past when Derek X was last
But now I'm on the top, damn, news travels fast
Cause I'm like that, they can't see this
Read my book, it contains many pieces of verses
I took the time to delete all the curses
So moms reach deep in your purses
And buy me, take me home and try me and do me well

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
Well, while I reign rhymes pour
You suck it up like a straw and jump on the dance floor
Cause every time I step in a jam
I make like a door and slam
But then girls try to turn my knob cause I'm a heart throb
I guess it's just a hazard that comes with the job
Cause every time I rock a rhyme that shows Jamar is intellectual
Girls want to get sexual
Well I guess I have to cope with being so dope
You want to be me, but can't see me with a telescope
You seek and search but still you can't find
You're weak and it hurts to be deaf, dumb and blind
A supreme mind will take you out of your paralysis
I grip the mic so tight I get callouses
And your analysis is that the Lord
Whips rhymes into shape with a mic cord
I do it good cause I'm a positive black man
Eating up suckers as if I was PacMan
Not a Dapper Dan fan, I stay casual
To rock like the J it comes gradual
You got to know the ledge to wise the dumb
And understand your culture of freedom
Power equally with the Gods
So you can build and born your cipher
All your life you must teach truth
Of the true and living God, not a mystery spook
And when you do that, pursue that goal
Which made the student enroll and only then you'll prosper

[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4
Hit it, hit it

[Verse 1]
Yeah, here's a story bout' my homeboy Randy
He was hooked on a girl named Candy
Started off as sex for fun
Now the girl's got him on the run
Made love to her just one time
Now she runs his body and mind
He calls everyday on the phone
But baby's playin' games (""Leave a message at the tone"")
Soft and gentle is not her style
This girl is so damn wild
All my partners wanna get next to her
But she ain't down with that, She moves right through 'em
Yeah, like paper plates
Tears 'em up and she throws 'em away
If you had any guts today
You'd get your butt up, and you'd walk away
But you're hooked

[Chorus 1]
Hooked, hooked
Know what I'm sayin', you're hooked, hooked
Hooked (Two, hit it!)

[Verse 2]
Yo, Get tough was your new campaign
Cryin' over a girl, boy, you're insane
She treats you like a dirty diaper
Use you one time and then she wipes you out
You understand what I'm sayin'?
If you're a man, you'll stop delaying and betraying
Try to act like you were mack
You can't go an hour without that sex attack
What's wrong, boy, is it that good? (You got it!)
There's a lot of girls that would and could
Take you, But you're so damn weak
I think you need to seek
Professional help, For your problems
Lay on the couch and let the doctor solve 'em
Talkin' to you and now he took your money
You're took on that honey, You're hooked (Hooked, hooked, hooked, hooked...)

[Chorus 2]
Hooked, hooked
Fellas, you know what I'm sayin', he's hooked
Ain't got an ounce of mack in him, he's hooked

[Verse 3]
Yeah, baby, run you, she takes your money
While you'll kick back cryin' over honey
Now, I must admit she's fly
But i'll be damned if oh me oh my
If I ever let a girl run my thing
I'm poppin' it the most, you know what I'm sayin'?
So understand, you gotta be real hard
Don't treat her like a dog, but let her know
You'll pull her card if she ever gets outta hand
What is you a boy or a man?
Stand up and tell baby you ain't gonna be shook
Yo punk, you're hooked on that s-s-s-y
I don't know why
I don't stand by
And just let a girl run over me
Fool, I'm a man, can't you see?
Boy, you're hooked

[Chorus 3]
Yeah, you're hooked, might as well give her to me man
Let me do the wild thing, you're hooked
Shoot, I'm poppin' it man, you're hooked

[Interlude]
Yo man, check it out, let me talk to you for sec
So, what's up, Vanilla?
Yo man, come here man, what?
You know, man, you ain't doin' it right. You're off man
See, you know what the problem is?
That ring I bought her... The diamonds weren't big enough (Nah man)
I'm tellin' ya' the diamonds weren't... I'm goin'... You know
What she wants... I'm goin' tell ya'... (Nah man, nah)
When I first met her she said she wanted a 'vette (A 'vette?!)
I'm gonna' get her a vette
No man, no...a 'vette...
I'm gonna get her the 'vette! (No man, hey, wait up!)

[Verse 4]
Now it's Saturday, the day you hate most
Why, because from coast to coast
You see girls everyday in the club, cold kickin' it
Reminds you of baby when you used to be wit' it
But now she took you one time for sex and you're so sprung
That the next time she seen you
We knew, she had to leave you
Boy, you're hooked

[Chorus 4]
Boy, you're hooked
Boy, you're hooked
Hooked
Hooked

[Chuck D]
Burn Hollywood burn I smell a riot
Goin' on -- first they're guilty, now they're gone
Yeah I'll check out a movie
But it'll take a Black one to move me
Get me the hell away from this T.V
All this news and views are beneath me
So all I hear about is shots ringing out
About gangs putting each other's head out
So I rather kick some slang out
All right fellas let's go hang out
Hollywood or would they not
Make us all look bad like I know they had
But some things I'll never forget, yeah
So step and fetch this shit
For all the years we looked like clowns
The joke is over -- smell the smoke from all around
Burn Hollywood burn

[Ice Cube]
Ice Cube is down with the P.E
Now every single bitch wanna see me
Big Daddy is smooth, word to mother
Let's check out a flick that exploits the color
Roaming through Hollywood late at night
Red and blue lights what a common sight
Pulled to the curb, getting played like a sucker
Don't fight the power...(gunshot)..the motherfucker

[Big Daddy Kane]
As I walk the streets of Hollywood Boulevard
Thinking how hard it was to those that starred
In the movies portraying the roles
Of butlers and maids, slaves and hoes
Many intelligent Black men seemed
To look uncivilized when on the screen
Like, I guess I figure you to play some jigaboo
On the plantation, what else can a nigga do
And Black women in this profession
As for playing a lawyer, out of the question
For what they play Aunt Jemima is the perfect term
Even if now she got a perm
So let's make our own movies like Spike Lee
Cause the roles being offered don't strike me
As nothing that the black man could use to earn
Burn Hollywood burn

""Now we're considering you for a part in our new production. How do you feel about playing a controversial negro?""
""Yeah, I'm wid it. You mean somebody like Huey P. Newton or H. Rap Brown, right?""
""Well, it's a servant character that chuckles a little bit, and sings.""
""Yo, man, what?? That's bullshit.""

""Hey Cube, Kane, Flav, listen. I hope you ain't wastin' my time. You know how I feel about givin' these movies my money, know what I'm sayin'?  I work hard for it""
""Yo, man, it's gonna be dope, man.""
""Chill, man.""
""Hey, I'm chill chill, but you know what I'm sayin', I just don't wanna, I can't go for this Steel Magnolia shit, know what I'm sayin'?""
""Come on, man, it's cool.""
Ladies and gentlemen, today's feature presentation: Driving Miss Daisy
""No, no, no.""
""Bullshit, just what I'm talkin' about, all this Terms of Endearment shit. I'm outta here, man, it's bullshit.""
""Yo, check it out, man I got Black Caesar at the crib, man, y'all want to go check that out?""
""That's the idea. We could have rolled with that from the get-go!""
""Fuck Hollywood, man.""

[Chorus]
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)

[Verse 1]
Bring on the moes and hoes
Don't snooze or doze 'cause I'm rippin' up shows
Hold your nose, dead bodies are around
I leave scratch marks under the tears of a clown
I write rhymes that shine like lipstick
So much material, but not materialistic
Imperial styles I use
When the mic is lifted, the crowd is amused
Come with it if you feel you're full-fledged
Or yell, ""Geronimo!"" and jump off the edge
Your E-N-D is near when I appear
The stage is yours, but wait until the smoke clears
Rhyme sayer and I'm here to lay a load
So watch a player when he's playin' in player mode
Uncle L's bad and you're soon to say
'Cause I rip the mic until the tune decay

[Chorus]
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)

[Verse 2]
MCs are dumb, I catch 'em in a dragnet
You're not complete, I'm battlin' a fragment
So creative and witty and outstandin'
And I be demandin' that you're abandoned
In the desert or a wild west town
While I'm at your crib on a cherry-go-round
Where will she stop? No one knows
Like I said before, bring on the moes and hoes
I know my ABCs and my Ps and Qs
Just chill and listen to the rhyme cruise
All aboard the cord, there's a reward
Some were ignored when they toured for the bored
The crowd wasn't loud, lyrics weren't endowed
Took a crack of the 40 and went to show 'em how
You like me now, but you didn't before
'Cause you forgot I was raw

[Chorus]
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)

[Interlude]
Uh
Future of the funk, uh
Go 'head, baby
Do it
Go 'head, baby
Do it
Yeah, do it

[Chorus]
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Yo, eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Uh, eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Yeah, eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Yo, eat 'em up, L)

[Verse 3]
It's so visual the way I'm throwin' down
Visualize MCs goin' down
In a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes
The moral of the story is I'ma get mines
I saw the cordless, boy, I'm gonna house that
Your rhymes are cheesy, you found 'em in a mouse trap
Don't try to front while the freestyle's droppin'
He wants to battle, he must be needle-poppin'
You better notify your next of kin
'Cause when I begin it's like a needle to the skin
If you wasn't prepared then you ought to be scared
But even if you was, you're aware what the rhyme does
I remember when you was an amateur
Writin' your rhymes, starin' at my signature
Bought the album, analyzed the style
Tsk-tsk (Achoo), God bless you, child
I'm unique when I speak to a beat
Another rapper'll fall when the mission's complete
I daze and amaze, my display's a faze
Every phrase is a maze as Uncle L slays
The competition that's lost in a freestyle
'Cause on the mic I'm the golden child
With the magical wand that they're callin' a mic
And when MC's approach it turns into a spike

[Chorus]
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Chill (Eat 'em up, L)
Why don't you just chill? (Eat 'em up, L)

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah, I wanna say what's up to my man Kool Herc
And my man Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation
Know what what I'm sayin'?
My man Marley Marl and DJ Clash
My man B-Blast
Rush Town, Def Jam, we in the house
Of course I gotta say what's up to my homeboys EPMD
Yeah, I get busy
Peace

28,Push It Along,People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (25th Anniversary Edition),A Tribe Called Quest,1990-04-17,454280,38,"

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Q-Tip is my title, I don't think that it's vital
For me to be your idol, but dig this recital
If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissing
Slinging this and that, 'cause this and that was missing
Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected
Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected
Afrocentric living, Africans be givin'
A lot to the cause, 'cause the cause has been risen
Some brothers, they be flamming, thinking we ain't slammin'
Coming off like the days when we used to wear the tans and
A blue-collar talker, hemisphere stalker
A glass of OJ and a ten mile walk-a
If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearing
Can I get a beep and a side order of cheering?
I am what I am, that's a tribal man
We all know the colors, we all must stand
As we start our travels, things they will unravel
""Que sera sera"", for this unit is like gravel
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

[Hook]
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Put one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher
The ills of the world make the situation lighter
The clock is always ticking, the systems should be kickin'
Like Tip said in ""Ham and Eggs"", I eat chicken, chicken, chicken
Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever
Embellish on the funk as we start to endeavor?
The roots of the rap filling up the gap
With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
The boom, the bip—the boom-bip
Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles
Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble
It's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty
So I kick the slash for the gipper and the witty
This ain't trial and error, more like tribin' era
Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
The street can't depart from the bloody heart
Repair the wear and tear, don't stop 'fore it starts
Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

[Hook]
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Marching off the project, we hope that you will subject
It's good to be an object and never, ever reject
The tribe who meanders with drunken propaganda
Keep it in boom and never will we slander
Redeems should be handed, don't let me demand it
Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it
Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
Although she's flipping crazy, give my love to Gracie
God, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey?
The pigs are wearing blue, and in a year or two
We'll be going up the creek in a great big canoe
What we gonna do, save me and my brothers?
Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
Never will we do that and we ain't trying to rule that
We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?
This society of fake reality
Are nothing but a peg of informality
While I sing my song, sing it all day long
If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is—

[Hook]
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along
Push it along, push it along
Push it along, yeah, push it along

Stop fool, come off that beat ya

Fade the grade, played, and made a few mil'
And I keep stealin'
Ice Cube'll make it thump
But right about now - *let's get over the hump*
But I don't party and shake my butt
I leave that to the brothers with the funny haircuts
And it'll drive you nuts
Steal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch
Like jackin' and mackin'
Say hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin'
And it sounds so sweet
Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob, is jackin' for beats

[Verse 3]
Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it
Locate a dope break, and then I break it
And give it that gangsta lean
Dead in your face as I turn up the bass
I make punk suckers run and duck because
I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to
Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm outtie
So when I come to your town don't crowd me
Cause I know, you're gonna wanna kick it with me
But I know, none of y'all can get with me
So you think you're protected
Well you are 'til you put a funky beat on a record
Then I have to show and prove and use your groove
Cause suckers can't fade the Cube
And if I jack you and you keep comin'
I'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!

*stop stop stop stop stop!

30,"Can't Do Nuttin' For Ya, Man!",Fear Of A Black Planet,Public Enemy,1990-04-10,166866,34,"

[Verse 1]
Runnin' for your life, by the knife
Runnin' from your wife, yikes!
You should've stuck with home
Off your mind to blow your dome
It was you that chose your doom
You built the maze you can't get through
I tried to help you all I can
Now I can't do nuttin' for you man

[Hook]
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You got all these people on your back now
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
Flavor Flav got problems of his own
I can't do nuttin' for you man
Go lean on Shell's Answer Man
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You jumped out of the jelly into a jam

[Verse 2]
Makin' love to wrong instead of right
Not a thief cat burglar through the night
Cop told your girl her name was Shirl
About a rooftop crime to steal her pearls
Uzi down the bullets in the gun
Just microwave themselves a ton
Lord, you tried to help them all they can
But they couldn't do nuttin' for ya man

[Pre-Hook]
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
They couldn't do nuttin' for you man
Yo G, listen

[Verse 3]
Flavor Flav is the sun
Public Enemy number one
Gotcha runnin' from the gun (Pow!)
Of a brain that weighs a ton
Can't face my facts that's on the shelf
Cause you want a handout for your wealth
Eatin' welfare turkey out the can
I can't do nuttin' for ya man

[Hook]
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You want six dollars for what?
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You better, man, kiss my butt
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
I'm busy tryin' to do for me!
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
That's the way the ball bounces, G

[Outro]
Bass for your face
Yo man
I can’t do nuttin'
Nuttin' for ya
I tried to tell ya
Rock that shit homey
Yo G, listen
I ain’t tryin to hear that
Kick that shit
You on welfare
Your mother got gold nipples
You got a rip in your couch
Wash your butt
(Kick that shit)
(laughing)

[Intro: Treach]
Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em

[Verse 1: Treach]
O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""people,"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple, huh
It's sort of like, oh well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello?
You get her name and number, then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house?
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that's why she's scary)
It's O.P.P. time, other people's, but you get it
There's no room for relationships, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at?
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splitting and co-hitting that?
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P., and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the homies)

[Verse 2: Treach]
Well, for the ladies, O.P.P. means something gifted
The first two letters the same, but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word rhyming with ""cleanest"" or ""meanest""
I won't get into that, I'll do it, uh, sort of properly
I'll say the last P, hmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife?
And you just had to stop a toast 'cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you, and you knew right away
He had someone, but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door, no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet door
Now don't be shy, 'cause if you're down, I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.), I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies)

[Verse 3: Treach]
A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must've been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, ""Let's go, my girl is coming, so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you, Treach,"" I said, ""Now, child, please
You gots to leave, come grab your coat right now, you gotta go""
I said, ""Now look, you choose the stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was O.P.P., hell, from the very start""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting, isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her, for sure, I'm going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it

[Chorus]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who's down with O.P.P.? (This whole party)

[Outro: Treach]
Break it down

[Produced by Sir Jinx]

[Intro]
Damn!
(Forgot to do somethin', let me see...uh)
Oh, yeah—it ain’t over, motherfuckers
""The motherfuckin' saga continues""
""Y'all motherfuckers ready for N.W.A? Well get the fuck up!""
""A bitch is a bitch. So if you're poor—""
“It was once said by a man who couldn’t quit, dope—”
“Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say”
But now, since he stepped the fuck off
""Here's what they think about you""
""That punk Ice Cube—""
""Here's what they think about you""
""Cube was suckin' so much New York dick""
""Here's what they think about you""
""Real Niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace""
""Here's what they think about you""
""Why y'all let his punk ass in the group""
""Here's what they think about you""
""When they was in London, they wasn't no good without fuckin' Ice Cube""
""Here's what they think about you""
""When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back""
""I smell...""
""Here's what they think about you""

""N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube!""
Fuck all y'all!

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight Bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who ya foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my Mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ay yo Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you been-a-dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most?
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flowed
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no vaseline

[Hook]
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it

[Verse 2]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Naw, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a mothafucking Ready Teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for ya, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B-210
Broke as a mothafucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the First Team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no vaseline

[Hook]
Now you're getting done, get-getting done
Now you're getting done, get-getting done
Now you're getting done without va-va-va-va-vaseline

[Verse 3]
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E a'be hanging from a tree
With no vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking bout?!
Get rid of that Devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk, too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
Eric Wright, punk, always into something
Gettin' fucked at night
By Mista Shitpacker
Bend over for the goddamn cracker
No vaseline

[Outro]
Mothafuckin' nosejob having ass
Mothafucking Jheri Curl lite
Ambi wearing mothafuckin' bitch

33,How I Could Just Kill a Man,Cypress Hill,Cypress Hill,1991-08-13,252240,61,"

[Intro]
It's another one of them ol' funky Cypress Hill things
You know what I'm sayin?
And it goes like this

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Hey don't miss out on what you're passin'
You're missin', the hoota of the funky Buddha
Eluder of your fucked up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaw stridin', when suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when they see me drivin'
By, hangin' out the window
With my Magnum takin' out some putos
Actin' kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from the street gettin' paid from my vocals

[Hook: B-Real & Sen Dog]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

[Verse 2: DJ Muggs]
I'm ignorin' all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is comin' from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around
My gat straight hummin'
Hummin'... comin' at cha...
And you know I had to gat ya

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin' a battle light
Sen got the gat, and I know that'll gat ya right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man!
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said ""Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed-out
How you like my chrome?"" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway...
Hahaha... that young punk had to pay
(So I just killed a man!)

[Hook]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

[Verse 4: B-Real]
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite ya with insights
And if you ain't down: bullshit!
Say some punk try to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time, play the role model?
No, I think you play like a thug
Next ya hear the shot of a Magnum slug
Hummin', comin' at cha
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gat ya
So how do ya know where I'm at, when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
When you're up on the hill in your bigger home
I'm out here riskin' my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, ay yo I gotta say ""fuck it""

[Hook]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

34,Mind Playing Tricks on Me,We Can't Be Stopped,Geto Boys,1991-07-02,308733,65,"

[Intro: Scarface]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

[Verse 1: Scarface]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
Is somebody watchin' the Ak'?
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit! There's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya

[Verse 2: Willie D]
I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5,000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin', I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder and peepin' around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me

[Verse 4: Bushwick Bill]
This year, Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
'Til a lawman got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down, we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
Goddamn, homie!
My mind is playin' tricks on me

Mista Bob Dobalina, won't you quit?
You really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior
You're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya
Why don't you behave ya little rugrat?
Take a little tip from the tabloid, because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me
Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes
You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it

[Verse 2]
Friends can be fraudulent, just you wait and see
First he was my moneygrip then he stole my honeydip
Mista Dobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?
The little two-tima resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the façade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes, even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask, all I had to do was ask Hemperor and Kwamé
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester, Dobalina
Because ya don't impress me Dobalina
The style of dress is not the key Dobalina
It's all in the mind and the heart, so you should start
By remembering ya gotta pay a fee Dobalina

36,By The Time I Get To Arizona,Apocalypse 91… The Enemy Strikes Black,Public Enemy,1991-10-01,288666,38,"

[Intro: Sister Souljah]
This is Sister Souljah. Public Enemy, Security of the First World, and all allied forces are traveling west to head off a white supremacy scheming to destroy the national celebration of Martin Luther King's birthday. Public Enemy believes that the powers that be in the states of New Hampshire and Arizona have found psychological discomfort in paying tribute to a black man who tried to teach white people the meaning of civilization. Good luck brothers, show 'em what you got

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
I'm countin' down to the day deservin', fittin' for a king
I'm waitin' for the time when I can get to Arizona
'Cause my money is spent for the goddamn rent
Neither party is mine, not the jackass or the elephant
Twenty-thousand niggy-niggy brothers in the corner
Of the cell block, but they come from California
Population is none in the desert and sun
With a gun cracker runnin' things under his thumb
Starin' hard at the postcards, isn't it odd and unique
Seein' people smile wild in the heat?
A hundred-twenty degree, 'cause I want to be free
What's a smilin' face when the whole state's racist?
Why I want a holiday? Damn it, 'cause I wanna
So what if I celebrate it standin' on a corner?
I ain't drinkin' no forty, thinkin' time with a nine
'Til we get some land, call me the trigger man
Lookin' for the governor, huh? He ain't lovin' ya, ha?
But here to trouble ya, he's rubbin' ya wrong
Get the point and come along, he can get to the joint
I urinated on the state while I was kickin' this song
Yeah, he appear to be fair
The sucker over there, he try to keep it yesteryear
The good ol' days, the same ol' ways that kept us dyin'
Yes - you, me, myself, and I, indeed
What he need is a nosebleed
Read between the lines, and then you see the lie
Politically planned, but understand, that's all she wrote
When we see the real side that hide behind the vote
And they can't understand why he the man, I'm singin' about a king
They don't like it when I decide to mic it
Wait, I'm waitin' for the date
For the man, who demands respect 'cause he was great, c’mon
I'm on a one mission to get a politician to honor
Or he's a goner by the time I get to Arizona

[Verse 2]
Well, I got twenty-five days to do it
If a wall in the way, just watch me go through it
'Cause I gotta do what I gotta do
PE number one, gets the job done
When it's done and over, was because I drove 'er
Through all the static, not stick but automatic
That's the way it is, he gotta get his, talkin' MLK
Gonna find a way
Make the state pay, I'm lookin' for the day
Hard as it seems, this ain't no damn dream
Gotta know what I mean, it's team against team
Catch the light beam

[Verse 3]
So I pray, I pray every day, I do and praise Jah the maker
Lookin' for culture I got, but not here from Jamaica
Pushin' and shakin' the structure, bringin' down the Babylon
Hearin' the sucker that make it hard for the Brown
The hard boulevard, I need it now more than ever now
Who's sittin' on my freedom, oppressor, people beater
A piece of the pick, we picked a piece of land that we're deserving now
Reparation, a piece of the nation, and damn, he got the nerve
Another nigga they say and classify we want too much
My people plus the whole nine is mine, don't think I even double dutch
Here's a brother, my attitude is hit 'em, hang 'em high
I'm blowing up the nineties, started tickin' in eighty-six
When the blind get a mind, better start fearin' while we sing it now
There will be the day we know who's down and who will go
Go, go, go
By the time I get to Arizona

[Chorus]
By the time I get to Arizona
By the time I get to Arizona
By the time I get to Arizona

[Verse 1: Treach]
Hey, you could smoke a spliff with a cliff
But there's still no mountain high enough
Or wide enough to touch
The naughty, nappy, nasty nigga, the nasty, trashy, ho-happy pappy
That's happy to be nappy
Me and Vin Rock win spots, hit flocks
In groups and troops with Timbo boots and jail suits
That's how I roll when my hairdo don't
When the will I got wantin' competition ain't dope
Beat ya, break ya, broke ya, smoke ya, take ya
Send you to your little group on mute sooner or later
He wanna flip, tell him full, semi, half with a dip
And all that other Ringling Brothers shit
Sporty, naughty, hi, bye, greater than nature, why I
Shin slam the flim-flam and then jam
You can run, but you can't hide, you can't go far
No matter where you go, there you are

[Chorus]
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash

[Verse 2: Treach]
Here we go, yo
Hit a nigga, kill a nigga, we'll come back
See a sucker, stretch a sucker, guard your naps
Cussin' wasn't nothin' 'til a Black man rapped
See a forty, suck a forty, guess who's back

[Verse 3: Vin Rock]
You're chillin' with a titty-feelin' villian
Steppin' to the puny, puddy punks catchin' feelings
I hit so many guts, call me gutter, I'm the bread and butter
Punk motherfuckers, I'll cut up, workin' from the gut up
Brand new steady, heavy as a Chevy
Ready for the piddy-peddy, I'm Friddie Freddie
Place your bet on a vet, the three-man threat
What you see is what you get

[Chorus]
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash

[Verse 4: Treach]
Comin' round the corner with my Uptown bunch
I bet your bottom dollar that you're bottom-bunk chumps
Give it up, it's a juice thing, I'm steppin' for the rep and
Wreckin' all the rest and weapon testin' on who's steppin'
Ain't no bluff for the niggy-nuff, for the rugged rough stuff
Nigga, if you're tough, knuckle up
I'll cut your ass like class, then blast you by the trash
After I laugh, then I'll dash
You can't handle the scandal of an uptown vandal
Shootin' up your toes, makin' sandals
Somebody told me that you own me, but can't nobody hold me
I do my dirt all by my lonely

[Chorus]
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash
We gonna break, we gonna bash
We gonna roll, we gonna smash

We gonna

[Intro]
Knowledge is power, and knowledge can be the difference between life or death
You should know the truth and the truth shall set you free

[Verse 1]
I was raised like a Muslim, prayin' to the East
Nature of my life relates rhymes I release like a cannon
'Cause I been plannin' to be rammin' what I wrote
Straight on a plate down your throat
So digest as I suggest, we take a good look
At who's who while I'm readin' from my good book
And let's dig into every nook and every cranny
Set your mind free as I slam these thoughts
And just like a jammy goes bow
You're gonna see what I'm sayin' now
You can't be sleepin', 'cause things are gettin' crazy
You better stop being lazy
There's many people frontin', and many brothers droppin'
All because of dumb things, let me tell you somethin'
I've been through so much that I'm such
A maniac, but I still act out of faith
That we can get the shit together so I break
On fools with no rhymes skills messin' up the flow
And people with no sense who be movin' much too slow
And so, you will know the meaning of the Gang Starr
Guru with the mic and Premier raise the anchor
Swiftly, as we embark on a journey
I had to get an attorney
I needed someone to defend my position
Decisions I made, 'cause now it's time to get paid
And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
Still, all of that is just material
So won't you dig the scenario
And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there I got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?

[Hook: Cuts by DJ Premier]
You can't handle the whole weight

[Verse 2]
The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind I find
That some try to be down just 'cause it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less traveled
So I can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'
That's why I'm down with the Nation
Spirituality supports reality
We gotta fight with the right mentality
So we can gain what is rightfully ours
This is the meaning of the chain and the star
Land is power, so gimme forty acres
Let's see how far I can take ya
Original invincible, that's how I'm lookin' at it
I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
Any means necessary, I'm goin' all out
Before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
So let me ask you, is it too late?
Ayo, who's gonna take the weight?

[Hook: Cuts by DJ Premier]
You can't handle the whole weight

This dick of mine ain't friendly, baby;
Will it hurt you? Yeah maybe
Probably, because I'm 19 years old;
I fuck hot pussy until it's cold

Women love me, they say I'm so cute
Girls wanna get with me, I'm tender;
A big old butt, and a smile and I'm wit'em

Well I'm an alley cat, some say a dirty rat
On my side is my gat, see I'm all of that
Spittin' out buck shots, boy I'm gonna wet'cha
Run and hide, but I'm still comin' to get'cha
Thinkin' like a peace smoke, comin' on a homicide
You talkin' shit, tryna take me for a ride
I'm not a bad guy, but I'm the funky feel
Finger on the trigger when my hands up on a steel
Lettin' out a bullet, this is goin' boo-ya
You're stuck in my hood, so what ya gonna do now?
Bein' the hunted one is no fun
Here I come son, yo I think ya better run
Better run more, and move a little faster
Second of thought and I'm comin' to blast ya
With my...

Comin' at you like a stiff blow, fuckin' up your program
Ain't takin' shit from you him or no man
Master mind maniac and a menace, soooo
How they want to pass the sentence
All because a nigga tried to play me on the trigger
He missed, so now the nigga's hist
Rude and crude like a pit bull, get to the point
Your fuckin' card will get pulled, now
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beatdowns
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beatdowns (Get your face down!)
Put me in chains, try to beat my brains
I can get out, but the grudge remains
When I see ya punk ass, I'm gonna getcha
Get some through ya, shotgun go boo-yaa!

Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Left hand on a forty, (Puffin' on a blunt)
Pumped my shotgun, (Them niggas didn't jump)

Kickin' that funky Cypress Hill shit
Think I'll light another for the blunted to chill with
'Cause I'm the chill one, known to get ill when
They stepped to the Hill ""What's up?"", I had to kill one
Now I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Livin' like a nigga who done lost his mind
'Cause I ain't goin' out like a spineless jellyfish
Some say life is a bitch
Ask that punk who dug his own ditch
Up on the Hill fuckin' up at a party
Tried to get funny, put a hole in his body
Lala la la lala la laaa
Look at all of those funeral cars
'Cause I'ma

[Airline attendant]
This is the final boarding call for flight 1259 departing from Los Angeles. Final destination to St. Louis. Thank you

[Verse 1]
Damn G, the spot's gettin hot
So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot?
Police looking at niggas through a microscope
In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope
They trying to stop it
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?
Catch a flight to St. Louis
That's cool, 'cause nobody knew us
We stepped off the plane
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers
Rented a car at wholesale
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grab the three-eighty
'Cause where we stayin', niggas look shady
But they can't fade South Central
Cause bustin a cap is fundamental
Peepin' out every block close
Seein which one will clock the most
Yeah this is the one no doubt
Bust a U, Bone, and let's clear these niggas out

Ay ay man, whassup nigga?
Yo, well this Lench Mob nigga!
*gunshots*

[Verse 2]
Now clearin' em out meant casualties
Still had the L.A. mentality
Bust a cap, and out of there in a hurry
Wouldn't you know, a drive-by in Missouri
Them fools got popped
Took they corner next day, set up shop
And it's better than slangin' in the Valley
Triple the profit makin' more than I did in Cali
Breakin' off rocks like Barney Rubble
Cause them mark-ass niggas don't want trouble
And we ain't on edge when we do work
Police don't recognize the khakis and the sweatshirts
Getting bitches and they can't stand a
Nineteen-ninety-one Tony Montana
Now the shit's like a war
Of gang violence, where it was never seen before
Punks run when the gat bust
Four Jheri curl niggas kickin' up dust
And some of them are even lookin' up to us
Wearing our colors and talkin' that gang fuss
Giving up much love
Dyin' for a street, that they never heard of
But other motherfuckers want to stand strong
So you know the phrase, once again it's on

[TV announcer]
Top of the news tonight, gangs from South Central, Los Angeles which are known for their drive-by shootings have migrated into East St. Louis, leaving three dead and two others injured. No arrests have been made. Police say this is a nationwide trend, with similar incidents occurring in Texas, Michigan, and Oklahoma
(""If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere!"")

[Verse 3]
(Boom) My homie got shot he's a goner, black
St. Louis niggas want they corner back
Shooting in snowy weather
It's illegal business, niggas still can't stick together
Fuckin' police got the 4-1-1
That L.A. ain't all, surf and sun
But we ain't thinkin' 'bout the boys
Feudin', like the Hatfields and McCoys
Now the shit's gettin' tricky
Cause now they lookin' for the colors and the Dickies
Damn, the spot's gettin' hot from the battle
About to pack up and start slangin' in Seattle
But the NARCs, raid about six in the mornin'
Try to catch a nigga when he's yawnin'
Put his Glock to my chest as I pause
Went to jail in my motherfuckin' drawers
Tryin' to give me, fifty-seven years
Face'll be full of those tattooed tears
It's the same old story and the same old nigga stuck
And the public defender ain't givin' a fuck
The fool must be sparkin'
Talkin' about a double life plea bargain
You got to deal with the Crips and the Bloods by hand, G
Plus the Black Guerilla family
And the white pride don't like no side
And it's a riot if anyone of us die
No parole or probation
Now this is a young man's summer vacation
No chance for rehabilitation
Cause look at the motherfuckin' years that I'm facin'
I'ma end it like this cause you know what's up
My life is fucked

[Man and (Police)]:
Police, eat a dick straight up
(Look here you goddamn nigga, you're not gafflin' nobody
You fuckin' understand me? [Kick his ass, put him down]
That's right, get down on the goddamn ground NOWWWW! Fuckin move, NOWWW! [Let me take a shot at him])
(We're gonna do you like ""King"")
What goddamn ""King""?
(Rodney King, Martin Luther King,  and all the goddamn Kings from Africa.)
Man 2: Look out, motherfucker

Count them fallin' off 1, 2, 3, 4 hundred at a time
Blood in the wood and it's mine
I'm chokin' on, spit, feelin' pain
Like my brain bein' chained
Still gotta give it what I got
But it's hot in the day, it's cold in the night
But I thrive to survive, I pray to god to stay alive
Attitude boils up inside
And that ain't it, you think I ever quit
Still I plan to get my hands around the neck of the man with the whip
3 months passed, they brand a label on my ass
To signify I'm owned, I'm on the microphone
Sayin' 1555, how I'm livin'
We been livin' here, livin' ain't the word, I been givin'
Haven't got, classify us in the have-nots

Antoine, Antoine's got something here
Ro-roll that window
We have to turn around because I want to shoot you
Park the limousine, in front of the swamp
Then I want to shoot you dauncing on the limousine
With the swamp in the background
It looks like you're in the jungle, okay?

Let's all sing, Pop Goes the Weasel!

[Pete Nice]
Pop goes the, pop goes the windin of the weasel
I see the empty pocket needs a refill

[MC Serch]
I got a squad with a list of complainers
I should have started RAPE:
Rappers Against Phony Entertainers
So we can make it known that we won't get swayed
It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change

[Pete Nice]
Gettin paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop (pop pop pop)
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop (drop drop dop)
Why not take your top ten pop hit
Vic the music and make senseless ryhmes fit

[MC Serch]
I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic
Intricate raps, becomin' so simplistic
I gotta strong mind, it doesn't have to be spoon-fed
And I can read what doesn't have to be read

[Pete Nice]
So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked
You go the ways of the weasel (the weasel)

[Chorus: 3rd Bass]
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop

[MC Serch]
Hip-hop, got turned into hit pop
The second a record was number one on the pop charts
For those that get on heart that gotta in the ghetto
Let no one forget about the hard part
Now in ninety-one we got a new brand, a new band
Lookin like the same old Klan
Same old theives that skeez so we gotta make sure
That real rap has got to endure

[Pete Nice]
Why score all my points in one period
Appearin in complex structure like a pyramid
The paper for the media presence
Ya learn lesson from the face of false legend
Stop vexin on the skills, ya ain't originate
The thin ice you skate upon will break and set ya straight
Ate up on the plate, now who's diesel
Not the weasel, not the weasel, pop goes the weasel

[Chorus: 3rd Bass]
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop

[Serch] Ya stole somebody's record then ya looped it, ya looped it
[Pete] Ya boosted the record then ya looped it, ya looped it
[Kurious] Aiyyo, I came from Cali, and they hooped it, they hooped it
[Pete] But now you're getting sued kinda stoopid

[MC Serch]
Boosted tracks get slaps, ya got no haps
To reach all four corners of the map
For kids in Kansas.. to those who speak Spanish
Doin crazy damage so the wack gets banished
Can't manage the truth until you buy a way
Ya ain't quick so ya switch off the exit from my highway
To rest but a crook, had to take a second look
Ever heard of a chef who can't cook?
But the Minister Prime can lay laws
Hey yo, Pete Nice, rip the mic and go for yours

[Pete Nice]
Goes for mine, I goes for mine
Find the Prime won't eat the green eggs and swine
On line like the Serch, in the hoody with the woody
Get a disc or tape, at Sam Goody
Why'd ya run through the doors some left open?
Ropin off the scenes of the crime smokin
I got pub and I'mma nut like a SCUD see
Blowin up, like I'm throwin up a beef patty
Sell-outs run a bout like the measles
No cures, cause pop goes the weasels

Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel

[Verse 1: Nice]
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
I'm sweeter and thicker than a Chick-O-Stick
Here's an ice cream cone honey take a lick
Or go to Bay Plaza and catch a flick
Wore my Timberland boots so I can stomp ticks
Scandalous get a whiff of this, miss
Just left the yard boys, now I'm blissed
I feel good per say good state of mind
Drive a red Sterling and the seats recline
I love it when a lady treats me kind
Go to Tavern on the Green and have a glass of wine
He say, she say, I heard it through the grapevine
No static, got an automatic
Too much of anything makes you an addict
Teasin, skeezin, all so pleasin
Don't ask why I got my own reasons
Smooth B, Greg Nice, Slick Nick clique
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick...

[Chorus]
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick

[Verse 2: Smooth B]
Sometimes I rhyme slow
Sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 125 and Saint Nick
Waiting on a cab, standing in the rain
Under my heart three clouds of pain
She got the best of me
What was her destiny?
Maybe I should lick her with my nine millime...ter
My mind is in a blur
Cause you could never pay me to think this would occur
Me and this girl Jane Doe was living together
We were inseparable, noone could sever
At least that's what I thought
But later I fought with her substance
And almost ended up in Supreme Court
When I was on the road doing shows getting ends
She was in my Benz getting sniffy with her friends
And even when she crashed my whip I didn't flip
My man Slick Nick said Smooth you're starting to slip
Time went on I started noticing weight loss
Then I had to ask her was she riding the white horse
At first she said no, then she said yo Smooth I'm sorry
But I keep having visions of snow, I need blow
And I said whoa, little hottie
I'm not DeLorean, Gambino or Gotti
I don't deal coke, and furthermore you're making me broke
I'll put you in a rehab and I won't tell your folks
And what do you know
In 18 months she came home and I let her back in
And now she's sniffing again...

[Chorus]
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick

45,Wildside,Music For The People,Marky Mark And The Funky Bunch,1991,307266,35,"

Ah yeah huh American the beautiful
Huh yeah let me introduce y'all to the wildside
Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks and no girl was sweeter
Come prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas singing nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it in all in stride
Cause deep inside annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making 50 to 55 thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that made heart beats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life the last for death
Now she's gone a former valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams, shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the wildside

(Chorus)

Ron had enough of being broke every day
Saying to himself. There's gotta be a better way
Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk on the wildside

(Chorus)

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job a good life. A good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupt and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
Put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect till someone was found
Interrogated cause their skin was brown
Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so
But soon as the case started moving slow
What do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill carol collect a big check
Blame it on a black man. What the heck!
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is on the wildside!

(Chorus)

Little Tiffany. Only thirteen
Came to the city. Place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summer time
Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees
And the girls play hopscotch
So far her vacation was top notch
But of the blue a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died
Innocently on the wildside

[Verse 1: Treach & Vin Rock]
Oh finally, finally (Here we are)
And for good are the three, follow me (It ain't far)
Even though if it was, you could make it to the start
The enemies, do you know who they are? (There they are)
A devil with the durags be walkin', now I had it up to there
Oh yeah, that's the last straw (The Nature's back for)
(Brothers and sisters, round, ugh, ugh)
Pin the tail on the junkie, find a false flavor
It's a new day to play with a neighbor
Freeze the MCs that wanna see thee
By now Naughty By Nature by me
They want me to come in comin' up faster, that could be arranged
That won't last to the master now, 'cause they couldn't stand the damn rain
The pain's the same, the game remains mine
I got more hooks than a fish line
Bite the head off the snake
Chew up from the first to last break, then shoot 'em in the face
Make way (Move), who are you to test me? (Huh, huh, huh)
I seen your last porno flick, it ain't impress me
What's up? Cuddle, sport, here's a thought
(The only records that they got are the records they crew bought)
Damn real, V-Rock, their fiendin' is funky
Pin the tail on the donkey

[Interlude]
(Bring that beat back)
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

[Verse 2: Treach & Vin Rock]
I do more poppin' than a blackhead, bread for waxheads
I'm fed (Go ahead, you retired tackhead)
Back to the fact of the track with a new thought
You couldn't smoke butts with a match and a Newport
Here we go, we go, we go again, with a flow we know, we know it's in
(Def play like Papa Simpson)
KayGee's on the slice, can he co-clean?
Doin' more scratchin' than a funk and a dope fiend
Cold knockin' blocks off, gettin' rocks off
I don't cock off, cop out, I knock cops off (Cops off)
Another renegade of rap, oh, stop that
I'm more feared than a Sugar Hill contract
I'm known for lettin' the hoes go, my demo's all flow
When cursin' was a no-no, you dodo
Give it up 'cause I'm hot with a warm hate
I won't stop, pop 'til that head is screwed on straight
I take shorts and no sorts, so take that, clone
The only thing I take is the A to the PATH home
And I take it all the way to the north stop
Your style's more foul than a pork chop
I rock the hip-hop, nonstop tick-tock
Around the big clock, with a spot, tick-tock
Pin the tail on the jackass, it don't mean jack (Chill)
To a brother from down the hill
Backtrack with a rap that remains funky
(Hmm, and it's funky)
Back in the day, y'all, I played with Play-Doh
The dough is real now, and dildos feel how
A starvin' hungry MC gets when
MC filet mignon is the fixin'
I'm starvin' up, it's time to carve them up, yup
Get 'em and cut 'em up, stuff 'em and cook the duck
Tough luck, tell 'em to shut up and jet
And feel the threat of a real life roughneck
Pin the tail on the donkey

[Interlude]
(Can I get a witness?)

[Verse 3: Treach & Vin Rock]
Check, check, where you, where you bet, bet
That another best will need a head vest for this head-check
(Wait, there's another Treach?), that's what I heard, yep
Three steps from a bllt-boom in his chest
I never knew a nigga really wanted to die
Instead of even instead of lookin' me eye-to-eye, then I
Knew he was truly through, dumb plus the one
To meet the mighty one, call a bad one
I rhyme about what I want to, microphone one-two
You do more light glosserin' than a bum do
T-H-E-M-C-O-F R-A-P-T-O-L-double-O-K
A-T﻿-I-N-T-H-E N-I-N-E-T-I-E-apostrophe-S, see
And I might stop to step to a sexy
Fancy, prancy, and dancy
No cosmo stomp, here's the true form
Style so fat, it gets fitted with a shoe horn
Here's a clearer mirror, dear ya
Look at it nearer, 'cause I don't fear ya
Some get too souped to the point
Where the stew too thick, but still lick through and through
I always wanted a guy to come and try
To get sly and try to get by my
Edit the treacherous style that's wreckin' it
Pin the tail on the donkey

Well, it's the Alley Cat puffin' on a hootie rat
Some think I'm a criminal but, yo I ain't all of that
Hit'cha with the baseball bat when ya wanna ill though
Wanna mess around, you get fucked on the hill bro
Kick it like a steel toe, real slow hits from the bong
Make me feel like Cheech and I'm kickin' it wit' Chong
Just like Cheech and Chong frontin' with ""Ice Cream""
Cypress Hill is here to give you a nice dream
Speak it like a rolla', and you know it's rolled tightly
I'm like the funky beat, so, why ya tryin' ta fight me
Pigs often site me, that's not polite G
And any hour of the day ya know I might be
Harassed by a pig real fast
They wanna Rodney King me, always tryin'a crown my ass
Ain't got no class (Sen Dog: No Class)
I hit they' ass like the buddah that's stinky
They wanna' scruff but, they' just so rinky-dinky
I'm the freaka, the one who freaks the funk
Sen got the Philly, and he's gonna light the blunt
Sippin' at the kufu make me go cuckoo!
Somethin' like loco then I turn into this loocoo
Bringin' the beta, yeah, now the funk is risin'
Got the beta bass and the nasal highs and
As I kick a trip, it comin' straight from my sinus
Crazy nasal vocals, cannot make the hotties loco
I remember sista Maggie, breasts were kinda saggy
Used to sell me buddha outta fucked up little baggies
Honey'd up a twenty even when I had no money
She said ""Pay me back with some Latin dick Sonnie""
Well I never went out, and I don't think I'm gonna
Just for some buddha, she wanted me to bone her
""Demeaning, ya think ya know what I meanin''
I got somethin' for the ho's ta be schemin' on
I'm the Buddha-Real I take a trip ta hoota'ville
I'll throw ya out the door... of my big blue Seville
Then light another joint, this ain't no exploitation (point)
For we are the ones strollin' in the ways of the masters

God damn!
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
And when dealin' wit' Da Lench Mob you gots to know steady mobbin' is not just the name of this jam, but a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers as known to break em' off something
Give it to me

""There goes the neighborhood""
""There goes the neighborhood""

""There goes the neighborhood""

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Four or five niggas in a mothership
Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent, front and back glass got tint
Tryin' to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools can't hold us
Every chance we get, we hittin' up the rollers
Comin' up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin' bean pies
Or the bootleg t-shirt of the month
With ""U Can't Touch This"" on the front
I'm 'bout to get rich
'Cause life ain't nuttin but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama hoes
So after the screwin'
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
I'm out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
'Cause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch, cause I'm steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Bustin' caps in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
Cause I'm gettin' major
Fuck Pactel, move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends:
Don't drink 8 Ball, cause St. Ide's is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin in the street
Niggas get mad, tempers are flarin'
'Cause they got a few bitches starin'
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches, make for happy Feds
I make it my duty to cuss 'em
Out, cause I just don't trust em
And if you tell on me I'm bombin' on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
(Steady mobbin')
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Since one-time so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
'Cause I'm rollin' on rims
Eating soul food, neckbones from M&M's
Grubbin' like a motherfucker
Greasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bailin'
When I hit a left on Ruthelen, ""Whattup loc?""
Don't you know that niggas get smoked
They take they life for a joke, get in nigga
I'll take you to the pad soon
Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my low rider
Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps
But hoes lickin' nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin' music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch
Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Give me the nappy and make me happy
The ho said 'Pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?'
I said yeah, but I don't play sex
Without puttin' on the latex
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night, no longer steady mobbin'

[Hook]
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, ""Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael""
It's all expected, things are for the lookin'
If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
Of this black man, and black woman fixture
Why do I say that? 'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man
Doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
And appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
If you diss—it gets drastic
Listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
All the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black man
Only if you are noted as my man
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'Cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that [ass]
(What?) A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half

[Chorus]
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves (words)
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

[Interlude: Sample]
""Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
Until it can be recharted for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
Time is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past—""

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip-hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these excursions so you must realize
That continually, I pop my Zulu [shit]
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a [bitch], brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare
(Or Edgar Allan Poe, or Langston Hughes, or...)

[Chorus]
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

[Outro: Sample + Q-Tip]
""—time is running out on black power advocates in the day and white thighed supporters at night
Every time you see them, they're chasin' some white woman with their tongue hangin' out

And they wince, defense is pressurized
They don't really want it to be another racial attack

[Scratched Hook]
Stick up kids is out to tax
And this is how the story goes

[Verse 1]
Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
'Cause in the night you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a four-fifth, I guess you just might
Wanna do a dance or two
'Cause they could maybe bust you for self or with a crew
No matter if you or your brother's a star
He could pop you and jet without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame from the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain that the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way he'll have the chain on his neck
Claiming respect, just to get a rep

[Scratched Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ten brothers in a circle had the kid trapped
The one with the hoodie said, ""We'll hurt you""
If you don't run all your jewels and pay
Give up the Rolex watch or you won't see another day
See they were on the attack
And one said, ""Yo, you wanna make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?""
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the .38, yo, he was inching
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings, and ran frantic
But shorty said, ""Nah"" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep

[Scratched Hook]

[Verse 3]
The rep grows bigger, now he's known for his trigger finger
Rolling with troops of his sons like a gangster figure
He's near the peak of his crazy career
His posse's a nightmare, macking jewels and crazy gear
But as we know, the things we do come back
And Shorty's not peeping, others are scheming to counteract
'Cause the kid that got shot didn't perish, so
He pulls up in a jeep with tinted windows
Too late, Shorty was caught in the midst
His time ran out, his number came up, and that's it
You know the rest, so don't front, the plan has been upset
Some brothers gotta go out just to get a rep

52,If My Homie Calls,2Pacalypse Now,2Pac,1991-11-12,258306,40,"

[Verse 1]
Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me, G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Saying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope game, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AK's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call

[Chorus]
""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all” “Brothers and sisters”
""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all” “Brothers and sisters”""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all” “Brothers and sisters”""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all” “Brothers and sisters”

[Verse 2]
It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was more 'caine
You got fame, now you run with no shame
I chose rap tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go, you're not lonely
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me
Call if you need my assistance, there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I be no different than the others
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
'Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call

[Chorus]
""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all”“Brothers and sisters”""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all” “Brothers and sisters”""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all” “Brothers and sisters”""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all” “Brothers and sisters”

[Verse 3]
Well, it's '91 and I'm living kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell, pal
But life making records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected, it's hectic, it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homie is making it elsewhere
Striving, working 9-to-5 with no healthcare
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred and blurred and changed in shape
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take my place or fall from grace
The bullet's late, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me, it's on
No matter who the foe, they must fall
Us against them all, I'm down to brawl if my homies call

[Chorus]
""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all” “Brothers and sisters”""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all” “Brothers and sisters”
If my homies call
""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all” “Brothers and sisters”""But if you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all” “Brothers and sisters”
If my homies call

We can take time, hold hands and chit-chatter
And what about love? Love's a possibility
But let's make sure we share the same mentality
Close the door, dim the lights
Everything is okey-dokey, cos we set it alright
And how bout oil? Warm from the heat

Make ya smile from a simple kiss
Close your eyes and I'll grant your first wish
Open your arms and wrap me tight like a teddy bear
Then take your fingers and run it thru my hair
Many will call but the chosen are few
But all I wanna know, is it good to you?

Champagne bottle in the corner half done
Room's still bright from the morning sun

54,Flavor Of The Month,A Wolf In Sheep's Clothing,Black Sheep,1991-01-01,259200,43,"

[Intro: Mr Lawnge]
Van Damme!
Let me see what kind of flavor I want
Hmmm. Do I want, vanilla?
Or do I want a taste of chocolate?
Nah. I want something different, I want something slamming!
What's the slammingest flavor out this month?
Let's see...
Yo black!
(Hmmmmm?)
What flavor are you?
(Listen...)

[Verse 1: Dres]
For a second, I reckon, I got ya double checking
Then again when to your needs did I beckon?
Hold me only if you wanna get naked
Play me for the crowd only if you wanna wreck it
The name is Dres, like silk I get slick
Drop rhymes like a basehead Bic flicks
Constantly, yes it's me
D-R-E-S
So yes, I guess, unless ya fess
You can get down to serious business, with this
I never boned a honey that I didn't like
I never saw a mile that I couldn't hike
I never had a spliff to make me choke
I never had a pocket that was broke
Hate no one but love only a few
Franklin, Grant and yeah mom duke
I run buckwild for self or with the crew
But then again, huh I thought you knew
Now I hear a voice, is it what you want?
I hope it is kid you're the flavor of the month

[Hook]
I heard you got the fever for the flavor [Repeat x3]
Somebody said you got it going on
I heard you got the fever for the flavor [Repeat x3]
Hurry up and get a scoop before it's gone

[Verse 2: Dres]
So you got the fever for the flavor of the other
Chocolate, sasspirilla, or is it you like another
Flavor in my socks, to the curly locks
Black Sheep rolling hard and knocking peons out the box
Never have I ever never ever felt much better
Did the whole nine, on the tenth I was no wetter
Ready and I'm eager, eager as a beaver
On the radio and good to go says your receiver
Not to be the boldest or the oldest nor the wackest
Neither am I needest or the newest or the blackest
Just a brown fellow who's not afraid of Jello
To the people of the world I would like to say G'day
Had to wait a while but the while has been waited
Never gave up hope in myself nor debated
Didn't shed a tear when I wasn't picked
Cause I got a cone now, want a lick?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dres]
Now I catch a number when before I caught a glare
Now I give a pound when before I gave a stare
Now I guess I kinda got it going on
I get a wake-up call on the norm
I used to try and push a demo now I have a Coupe
That's a bit more than a little, but then not quite a few
Funny how they find you when they told you get lost
Tell me why you're gritting when you have no dental floss
Wasn't my loss, thought you were the boss?
You never knew how much the Sherbet cost
Forget it, I never sweat it
Your girl will give me play I'll wet it
It only happens yes because you let it
Now everybody wants to play my phone
I see em with a spoon, I see em with a cone
You never knew I knew it but I knew you would pursue it
Hurry up and get a scoop before it's gone

On that bitch! Look at the titties!""

(Mixx scratches ""Aw hit me!"" and ""Hold your legs up on easy."")

Verse 1 [FKI:]
There's only one place where we can go
To see freaky hoes doin' shows
Doin' tricks to make us holler
On a giving night, all for a dollar
Silicone breasts, all on their chests
Nothin' like others, but above the rest
They'll do anything to turn us on
Them hoes got it goin' on!!
[BM:]
I like big booty and big ol' titties
Bitch, you know you've been fucked by many
So come and be my private dancer
I got some money if that's the answer
I really wanna be with you;
I get hard after seeing you
How hard? Hard like a rock
When you make that pussy pop!

Chorus [Luke:]
Pop that pussy! Heyyy! Pop that pussy, baby!
Pop, pop that pussy!Heyyy! Pop that pussy, baby!
Pop, pop that pussy!Pop, pop that pussy baby!
Pop that pussy! Pop, pop that pussy, baby!

Verse 2[FKI:]
Freaky bitches with plenty of ass
Rollin' to the music and shakin' real fast
Bend over backwards, make me shout
And work that pussy, in and out
Movin' their body with plenty of action
Bringin' to the men more satisfaction
Doin' what they feel to turn us out
Just work that pussy all the way out!
[BM:]
Shake it! Don't break it!
It took your momma nine months to make it
Bend over and spread 'em, girl
Show-w-w me those pussy pearls
Rub that ass and play with that clit
You know I like that freaky shit
Girl, you know you look so cute
Throwin' that pussy the way you do!

Chorus[Luke:]
Pop that pussy! Heyyy! Pop that pussy, baby!
Pop that pussy! Heyyy! Pop that pussy, baby!
Pop, pop that pussy! Pop, pop that pussy, baby!
Pop, pop that pussy!Pop, that pussy, baby!

Verse 3 [FKI:]
Poppin' that pussy's a dance for the ladies
Straight from the South, into the 90's
Freaky bitches are the ones I like
In G-strings in the middle of the night
Smoke-filled stages, bitches in cages
Guards at the door, armed with gauges
As they dance and I get hot
Keep throwin' that pussy! Don't stop!
[BM:]
I like the way you lick the champagne glass
It makes me wanna stick my dick in your ass
So come on, baby, and pop it quick
I fall in love when you suck my dick
Bitch, you don't know? You ain't heard?
Fuckin' with me, you're gonna get served
See, none of my bitches, they never complain
So come on, baby, and pop that thang!

Chorus[Luke:]
Pop that pussy! Pop, pop that pussy, baby!
Pop that pussy! Pop, pop that pussy, baby!

[Scratches: DJ Premier]
Step up

[Verse 1: Guru]
Once you step in the arena, cheater; you're gonna be a-
Mazed when you gaze at the armor on this leader
Fully clad and glad to fight a cause, I won't pause
Fear is a joke, slowpoke, I'm like claws
That'll rip 'cause your gift is merely flesh
Superficial and I wish you would give it a rest
But if you don't, I'll unsheath my Excalibur
Like a noble knight, so meet your challenger
A true hero, while you're a true zero
Gettin' beat to a pulp so that you can't run for help
I heard a gulp in your throat 'cause you hope that I'll be merciful
But coo-cluck, I made you strut as I rehearse a few
Battle drills, and watch your bladder spill
Yellow fluid, check how I mellowly do it
Face defeat to this beat, you can tell I'm into it
As I'm pullin' out my lance to kill you and advance to
The winner's throne; 'cause I own you once you step in the arena

[Scratches: DJ Premier]
Step up

[Verse 2: Guru]
In the arena... or rather coliseum
There's people gatherin' by multitudes to see one
Perpretrator fall to the dust after the other
Quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
Born with the art in his heart that is Spartacus
And one-to-one combat Jack, just a thought of this
Match-up makes Gang Starr wanna snatch up
One or two phrases from the new book with new pages
Of rhymes that are built like a chariot
Dope vocals carry it to the battle set
If a beat was a princess, I would marry it
But now I must bow to the crowd as I stand proud
Victorius, glorious, understand now
'Cause battles and wars and much fights I have been through
One MC got beheaded, and you can too
Forget it, 'cause you'd rather be just a spectator
An onlooker, afraid you may get slayed
Or struck by a blow from a mic gladiator
I betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
'Cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
And in just one lyric, you got snuffed out
'Cause rhymin' is serious, I'm strong, I'm like Hercules
You'll get hurt with these lines, close the curtains please
And suckers can jet 'cause I wreck once you step in the arena

[Scratches: DJ Premier]
Step inside my arena

[Verse 3: Guru]
In the arena or forum, weak MCs, I will floor 'em
Causin' mayhem, I'll slay them, and the blood'll be pourin'
Furthermore I implore that as a soldier of war
I go in only to win and be the holder of more
Trophies, titles, and triumphs 'cause I dump all the sly chumps
Never choosin' to lose my spot, not once
For the mere idea of an opponent that I'd fear
Is foolish utterly, I mean, what nut'd be
Tryin' to toy with a destroyer of many
You shitted your pants 'cause you can't think of any
Foe that could step to this concept so
You better sit again, citizen; weak MC's, I get rid of them
Watch the way they get distraught when they get caught
In the worst positions 'cause they didn't listen
And tried goin' up against a hungry killer who's itchin'
To maim and murder, those who claimed that they were the
Toughest ones, they get done once they step in the arena

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half step cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged

[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
""Oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

[Chorus]
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out
Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

58,Violent,2Pacalypse Now,2Pac,1991-11-12,385933,39,"

[Verse 1]
They claim that I'm violent just cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin' fits ’cause I'm not buyin' it
Defyin' it, envious because I will rebel against
Any oppressor - and this is known as self-defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
’Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished
The Underground Railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
I told 'em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin' from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me
They call me militant, racist, 'cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin', motherfucker censor this!
My words are weapons and I'm steppin' to the silent
Wakin' up the masses, but you, claim that I'm violent

[Chorus]
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""

[Verse 2]
The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, ""Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?""
He had the nerve to, say that I had a curfew
(""Do you know what time it is?
Get out the fucking car, or I'll hurt you!"")
Get out the car - or I'lI hurt you
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
(Ay man... Aiyyo... Ay man, just c'mon?)
(""What you doin man?"")
They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked (""I'm out"") he tried to run
(Freeze nigga!) I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped, so I hit the cop
I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
(Argh, fuck you! Ungh!)
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Givin' him a taste, of trading places
And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin' this
Frame up, but I came up
Now they claimin' that I'm violent

[Chorus]
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""

[Verse 3]
As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-ohh)
Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop (Damn!) now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away
(Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here.)
They called for backup, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start (Damn!) we in deep shit
So we jumped out (C'mon, let's take the cop's car)
We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
(that's a lotta of one time)
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
(yeah, it's on now)
Load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot 'em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we through sprayin' then we steppin'
This is a lesson, to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust
(What's next man?) What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One thing fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me
(Pass me a clip) Pass me a clip, G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Givin' them a reason, to claim that I'm violent

[Chorus]
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""

59,Tonite,Quik Is The Name,DJ Quik,1991,323266,53,"

[Intro]
Here we go
Yo

[Verse 1]
A day in the life of a player named Quik
I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow with a head like a brick
And just because I drink the eight, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc-ness
Now this is how we do it when we checkin a grip
Teddy Bear is in the house, so don't even trip
We're bustin funky compositions as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm
It's Friday morning, the phone is ringin' off the hook
And AMG is in the den reviewin' rhymes in his notebook
Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack
I pick up the phone and it's the D (Wassup, nigga?)
He said he's comin' down about two on the dot
So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot
And now I'm soakin', a brother like the devestatin' DJ Quik ain't jokin'
Fuck with me on DSP and you'll get broken
My name is Quik, but you can call me daddy
Yo, open up the door 'cause here come Freak-man in a Caddy
Now Freaky's in the El-Dog and Shabby's in the El-Co
And everybody's sippin on a quart (Here we go!)
D just came with a forty and a quart
In addition to the three that Greedy just bought
But I don't wanna start early, so I just might
Put my forty in the freezer 'cause I wanna get bent

[Chorus]
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yeah)
Tonight
Tonight is the night
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yo, when we gone get bent?)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Aw yeah)

[Verse 2]
And now I'm out of the tub, I'm feelin' fancy free
Spray on some Xeryus and put on my Givenchy
Sweatsuit, the gray one with the burgundy trim
And it's a medium, fit me proper 'cause I'm nice and slim
Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin'
And I am steadily thinkin' about the eight that I'll be drinkin'
You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful
So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful
Hamm is in the bedroom rollin' up a stencil
Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil
Freaky lit it up and hit it one, two, three
Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me
(It's the bomb!)
Yo, I can feel my senses (Gettin' numb!)
Yo, fuck the forty ounce (I need some rum!)
I'm chillin' like a villain (Here I come!)
And that's how I'm livin'
Tonight is the night and I'm lookin' real sporty
Proper Friday evening, and I'm ready to party
Crusher came in with a handful of snaps
Fuck it, let's shoot some craps
(Yo what they in fo'?) A fin or a half
(Yo shoot that ten, nigga!) Don't make me laugh
Hi-C won a dub and he think that shit is funny
But I'm seven and eleven and I'm takin' niggas money

[Chorus]
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yeah, watch me bust a ho)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Passin' naturals on motherfuckers)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yo, I'm unfadeable)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (ahh, let's break it down, so I can get funky)
Tonight

Ahh yeah
Givin' em somethin they can roll on
Hold on

[Verse 3]
Wake up Saturday morning, and I got a headache
I can't believe that I'm sick from all the shit that I drank
(Last night)
Soon as I felt it comin' on, I shoulda quit
It's true that a drunk ain't shit
To the man up above to whom thanks I give
I'll never drink again if you just let me live
Mike P spoke to me and I said I couldn't call it
Callin' Earl like a mother while I'm grippin the toilet
I need a 7-Up, because my head is spinnin
Round and round, I think I better sit down
My homey Shot is alright, but I'm feeling faint
I guess he's used to it, but a nigga like Quik ain't
K is on the phone, and Teddy's at the door
And some fine ass bitches comin over at four
(I thought you wasn't drinkin no more) Yeah right
Because as soon as they come, we doin' the same ol' shit tonight

[Chorus/Outro]
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Yeah)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Straight gettin' fucked up, hey)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Fuck that pass me that piña colada man, I don't wanna fade that eight ball no mo')
Tonight
Tonight is the night (That shit be fuckin' a nigga up)
Tonight
Tonight is the night (Aw yeah, nothin' but a party and I'm kickin' it)
Tonight (What's up Greedy Greg?)
Tonight is the night (How you livin?)
Tonight (Hey, somebody get that nigga a Genuine Draft)
Tonight is the night
Tonight (Yeah)
Tonight is the night (And on that motherfuckin' note, I'm outta here)
Tonight (See ya)

To-To-To-Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
To-To-To-Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
To-To-To-Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
We out (What about peace?)
Fuck peace, nigga, give me another brew

60,Poor Georgie,Act Like You Know (Explicit Version),MC Lyte,1991,270093,41,"

[Verse 1]
I met him in a club hangin' out one night
He said, ""Hello, I'm George...hi, Lyte
How's everything going, huh? How ya doin'?
Hope everything's fine, ooh, and uh umm
Can I call you sometime? Can I get the digits?
And the address, so I can come visit?""
I gave him the digits, that wasn't a problem
'Cause if he caused any, I would have to solve them
'Cause George looked good, MMM, damn good!
And if I didn't, some other girl would
In my mind, I hope for the best
Convincing myself that this was not a test
'Cause I heard many things about Georgie
Nothing kinky, like no orgies
I heard he knows how to make love
Like an angel from the heaven above
Who was I kidding I'd give him a try
'Cause Lyte needs love too and that ain't no lie
Keep your ears open, hope that you listenin'
'Cause I'm about to take you on a George Porgie mission

""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty...""

[Verse 2]
I gave him the number, I saw it in his eyes
""She gave me the number? Hmmm I'm surprised""
Good conversation over the phone
He began to comfort me whenever I was alone
George was sweet, so nice and so neat
With any other guy he didn't have to compete
George was mature, he made sure
That he was the only man I'd ever adore
Girls, have you, ever had a friend
That you'd get with, every now and then?
I know for a fact George had a lot of girls
Spread out from state from state around the world
As long as he was smart and kept his girls in check
Made sure I never saw them and showed me respect
He didn't have to be loyal, like men should be
I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me!
But if I ever saw one, that would be the end
He couldn't kick the storyline that she was just a friend
The girls I didn't care if her ass don't lie
See 'cause Georgie was into making young girls cry

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is...""
""Kissed the girls and...""

[Verse 3]
George was clean, no drugs and such
But once in a while, he'd drink too much
Hangin' in a club where they play rockers
Him and his friend, drinkin' vodka
I was looking for him, and I found him there
With his clothes messed up and his (fucked) up hair
I told him he was messin' up, he wouldn't go far
He got mad and asked his friend for the keys to the car
I said, ""Don't drive, use your head
Drive while you're drunk and you'll kill yourself dead""
We begin to argue, bad words were said
Then he got kicked out by some long-haired dread
Ran into the car as if, in a hurry
He started the car but his vision was blurry
He didn't care, he drove off into the night
Riding for miles, without his headlights
Georgie Porgie had too much on his mind
He was still young yet running out of time
Last week he took tests and the doctor told him
George had cancer in his lungs and his colon
See when he was twelve, he started smokin'
Paid no attention when he started chokin'
Thoughts flashed through his head, there they stuck
'Til Georgie Porgie crashed into a truck
I wished I woulda told him how I liked him so much
How he made me feel with the slightest touch
Now he's gone and I can't tell him nothin'
Wish he was here so I could say somethin'
The story is not to say that I'm in sorrow
Just to say no one is promised tomorrow
If you love someone you should say it often
You'll never know when they'll be layin' in a coffin
Wake up, it's important that you know that
No one on Earth is promised tomorrow...
Believe that! And don't think that it can't happen to you

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is...""

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

61,The Choice Is Yours,A Wolf In Sheep's Clothing,Black Sheep,1991-01-01,203173,41,"

[Intro]
Oh, Yeah! Yeah, baby!
That's it, that's it!
I'm working with that

[Verse 1]
Who's the Black Sheep? What's the Black Sheep?
Know not who I am, or when I'm coming, so you sleep
Was it in your room, or was it in your sphere?
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-R-E-S, yes I get suckers start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here one apart
Back, middle, to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey? (Hey!)
Now get a yo! (Yo!)
You got a hey? (Huh!)
It's for the hoes (Oh!)
The styling is creative, Black Sheep of the Native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the Quest
Deaf, retarded uncles, in parties where they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam now
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours

[Hook]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at, where it's at

[Verse 2]
Where's the Black Sheep? Here's the Black Sheep
Even if we wanted to, the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that?
Because, in fact, on me, it might not attract
Therefore, I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Y'know what I'm saying?
Yo, Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this or go with this with no delaying
See, in actuality, one day can it be
I made it look easy because it is to me
Anytime capacity was filled, try to rock it
Anytime a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was a fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat

[Hook]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at, where it's at

[Verse 3]
Now you can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, yes, for this is kind of phat
If you get with that, then you will surely miss
Because that is so wack, I think you'll get with this
For in the day in my life, or rather the life through my days
Never sweat the chaos, for a Balck Sheep has ways
Although, how shall I say it? Take a point, convey it
Styling is quite Dolby, yes, I know those for you play
Not to be all that, thought all that is my goal
Stumble and fell, brother, like Dres would roll
Need a sexy honey for a twilight stroll
Gave up on sushi, give me an egg roll
At A&W, get to the Root, with a boot or sneaker
Get near a speaker, demo to a single
To the kind with fly hoe, damned the scenario
And pass a plate or cross the fader
Black Sheep getting played, like a Sony Innovator
Dres, the creator of a style that is much greater

[Hook]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at, where it's at

62,Ain't No Future In Yo' Frontin',MC Breed & DFC,MC Breed,1991-01-01,244733,49,"

Intro : (Flavor Flav)
To the beat Ya'll
Ah yeah
(Ya don't stop)
Sound good to me

[ VERSE 1: MC Breed ]
This sound hard, somethin' funky people gon' dance to
Give the record a second and a chance to
Hittin' people like a scene of amazement
While they slippin' back, my feet is planted in the pavement
Crumble I can never do
So now I'm lookin' dead at you
What are you gonna do?
You listen to the knowledge of a scholar
You say ""How Breed?"" tell em how I holler
I'm the E Double, and I proclaim my name
Straight up good game, peeps all game
I'm like a rhino runnin' through the roughest pack
They figure I'm a trigga-happy nigga, so they step back
Breed, the microphonist
Boot last the longest
The noose's the strongest
It ain't a game, that's plain to see
You listen to the sounds of Breed (and the DFC)

There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 2: MC Breed ]
I never got caught with a kilo
And if you ever do, yo, it will never be with me, yo
Servin' in a Cherokee or maybe it's a GTO
Black-on-black Benzo, I get it at [Name]
Never have to worry bout my posse gettin' jumped
Cause if we ever do, yo TB, pop the trunk
Cause we don't go for playin', when I play go grab a ball
When I'm on the mic I ain't for playin', not at all
Cause I clock 10 g's a week boomin' at my peak
Always seek E sober, but I do get geeked
I can give you a job, a place to eat hearty
Meet your homeboy Marty at a b.o.b. party
Takin' over, barkin' like a dog named Rover (woof!)
I'm pickin' suckers like a four-leaf clover
They're bitin' lyrics on the mic, I diss these cobras
So now they're sayin', ""Eric Breed is gettin' over""

There ain't no future in your frontin'
Ha-ha-ha
There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 3: MC Breed ]
I'm the B, the r to the double e-d and
Down with my homie G-a-s and O.E. and
Suckers causin' static, cause they still be disagreein'
I don't give a - cause I'm from F-l-i-n-t'n
A city where pity runs low
If you ever shoot through my city, now you know
Cause we are strictly business and we also got our pride
And if you don't like it, I suggest you break wide
Suckers steady lookin' for the m-o-n-e-y and
Thinkin' that illegal is the best way, so they dyin'
I ain't got time to see a fiend fiend out
To give up all his money, and he givin' what he got
That's the way I am, MC Breed cannot be different
Never change my ways for the world or the government
If I was the president, then I would state facts
You leave it up to me, I paint the white house black
It ain't no future in your frontin'

There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 4: MC Breed ]
Yeah, I got dollars in my pocket, not from rollin'
If I was a fiend, then my gold would be stolen
Put my name Breed on everything I own
And when I get my jeep I'm puttin' 'Breed' on the chrome
Shine it up good, kickin' through my neighborhood
Motorola phone, fat rims and a Kenwood
Quick to get around it, and then I'll have it drop
Simply cause I'm ridin' people think I'm sellin' rocks
But ain't no future in your frontin'

Yo Flash man, drop that, man
Won't you drop that

(Keep on)
(To the beat ch'all)

[ VERSE 5: MC Breed ]
Cruel to the rules of the world
Live my life raw, cause I never liked the law
Wear top tens, on my ass use jeans
Sellin' big 8ths and tit-for-tat to the fiends
Clock much dollars, but I never break a sweat
Time to move out, my posse sayin' (bet)
You got my back, and I got yours
What time is it? Hm, Tear down the doors

Man
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Never was, cuz
There ain't no future in your frontin'

Hey man, let's start this party up, right?

(Beat y'all)
(Keep on)

[Chorus: A Tribe Called Quest]
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda, or your Bimmer, or your Legend, or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer

[Chorus: A Tribe Called Quest]
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg, Q-Tip, and both]
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
How's about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna diss me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah (huh), so whom shall I fear? (Word)
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare (uh)
So jet to the store, and buy the LP (yeah)
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged (huh?) by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too (ha-ha)
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers (Yeah)
So the new shit can rock (uh), from Bronx to Massapequa (uh)
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
So peace to that crew (yeah), and peace to this crew (Yeah)
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below, you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask
(""What's, wrong?"") Now check it out

[Outro: Q-Tip]
All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop
Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop
I said because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's, ya don't stop
And De La Soul, ya don't stop
To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop
Everybody in the place ya don't stop
You keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop
And last but not least on the sure shot
It's the Zulu nation, heh

I dig 'em, smack, I'll get you back, and I'll hit with a dose
Of Oaktown power
And chargin' by the hour
I'm shakin' like a quake and funks get devoured
I choose to abuse, misuse, and confuse
Competitors who think that they're makin' up all the rules
Fools in the game, lame and insane
It's a shame I gotta do this but I remain the same
Unchanged, gettin' better never known as a sweater
Kickin' it at the top because I got myself together

My people, we don't know defeat
We crush the strong and percolate the weak
Daily (Everyday), we make our move
To improve our groove because we love to rule
Where we lay, yo (Yo!), work and play
We started at the bottom, now we're leading the way
And, yay, I'm havin a fit
Kickin' it at the top because I'm too legit to quit (Sing!)

65,The Wrong Nigga To Fuck Wit,Death Certificate (25th Anniversary Edition),Ice Cube,2017-06-09,168333,41,"

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
God damn, it's a brand new payback
From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
How many motherfuckers gotta pay
Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK
Caps gotta get peeled
Cause ""The Nigga Ya Love to hate"" still can ""Kill at Will""
It ain't no pop cause that sucks
And you can New Jack SWING on my nuts
Down wit the niggas that I bail out
I'm platinum bitch and I didn't have to sell out
""Fuck you, Ice Cube!"", that's what the people say
Fuck AmeriKKKa, still with the triple K
Cause you know when my nine goes buck
It'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from 12 stories up
Now let's see who'll drop
Punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hip-hop
Fuck R&B and the runnin' man
I'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand
Make sure before you buck wit duck quick
Punk, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with

""I'ma let y'all know one thing man..""

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em
Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin L.M
It's the number one crew in the area
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
Punks roll when I put in work
Cause Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
South Central, that's where the Lench Mob dwell
Hittin fools up with the big ass L
One time can't hold me back
Sweatshirt, khakis and croaker sacs
Stop givin' juice to the Raiders
Cause Al Davis never paid us
I hope he wear a vest
It's all about the L-E-N-C-H y'all know the rest
Muthafuckin' crew, muthafuckin' mob
Do a muthafuckin' job in a muthafuckin' squad
In '91 Ice Cube grew stronger and bigger
And I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with

""One-and-two, ah-three-e-and-ah-four-and..""
""Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute""

[Cube] Drop a old school beat!

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Like I said, it's a brand new payback
Now in '91, let's see whose beats get jacked!
Sir Jinx grew a little bit taller
(Keep the wack beats out)
True motherfuckin' baller
And hoes can't roll on
Even bitches looking like En Vogue gotta ""Hold On""
Don't let me catch Daryl Gates in traffic
I gotta have it, to peel his cap backwards
I hope he wear a vest too, and his best blue
Goin' up against the Zulu
Break his spine like a jellyfish
Kick his ass til I'm smellin shit
Off with the head, off with the head I say
And watch the devil start kickin'
Run around like a chicken
Grand Dragon finger lickin'
Yo, turn him over with a spatula
Now we got, Kentucky Fried Cracker
Mess with the Cube, you get punked quick
Pig, cause I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with!

""Last person in the world you wanna fuck with"" (x3)

66,Lovesick,Step In The Arena,Gang Starr,1991-01-15,207000,36,"

[Verse 1]
Strangely enough I've been struck
Affected by her smile, and yo, her style is worthwhile
And knowing that I'm deep like a river, I feel I should give her
Things that those others can't deliver
Contrary to what I had wished, it seems that I've been dissed
But hey, I don't want to miss this
Wonderful opportunity, my boys, they try schoolin' me
But see I know what I want
Someone who'll be there for the whole nine, this honey is so fine
But now she's hung up the line
Upset because I told her I'm busy, she made like a grizzly
And started chewin' my head off
Screamin' that I spend more time with friends
And also, she said I ruined her weekend
I said ""I know the stuff we had planned but please understand
Right now I'm loungin' with my man""
I guess I didn't realize I'd hurt her, she said I had the nerve to
Just neglect her like that
Then she started bringing up past things and she kept asking
How come our love isn't lasting?
I said, ""Hey baby, please calm down 'cause I'm still around
And it's for you that my heart pounds
Can I call you later on? You say I treat you wrong?
But why you flippin' on me?""
She said something else and then click
Left me alone on the phone with the tone
And now I'm Lovesick

[Bridge: DJ Premier scratching]
Love... sick, sick, sick, sick

[Verse 2]
Relationships can grip with the pain
Arguments in the crib, in the streets, on the train
I'm crazy fed but then still
When she ain't there I feel sad, I feel ill
Frowning 'cause I'm down in the dumps
The other night I took her out, so she could shake her rump
But after we were there for a few, some girls that I knew
Stepped up and asked me to come to
A party they were havin' at their house
I looked at my girl, and yo, she started walkin' out
I said ""Hey love, just wait for a second, and won't you just check it?
It's all a part of makin' records
Those were just some friends in the business
No need to get angry, so listen up while I kick this
And what about the things we discussed about havin' trust?
What's all this attitude stuff?
Now hon, you know that I wouldn't play you
But time after time, you let your jealousy sway you
Hey, don't you turn your back like that, come on, this is wack
You're heated up like a thermostat""
Then she stepped off in a whirlwind
And I don't know when or if I'm gonna see her again
I could've sworn she was the right one to pick
But now... man, I'm just Lovesick

67,Brenda's Got A Baby,2Pacalypse Now,2Pac,1991-11-12,233466,54,"

[Intro: Dave Hollister]
Brenda's got a baby
Brenda's got a baby

[Verse: 2Pac]
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
""That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family""
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his arms
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say ""you makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day""
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby

68,Trapped,2Pacalypse Now,2Pac,1991-11-12,284693,49,"

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on the streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
Nine-millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me
'Cause they never taught peace in the black community
All we know is violence, do the job in silence
Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers, daily headed for the big pen'
Niggas comin' out worse-off than when they went in
Over the years I've done, a lot of growin' up
Gettin' drunk, throwin' up, cuffed up, then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out to money and fame
I changed my name, played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho
And when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, G
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi
They got me trapped

[Chorus: Shock G & 2Pac]
Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
They got me trapped, can barely walk the city streets
Without a cop harasskin' me, searching me, then askin' my identity
Hands up, throw me up against the wall, didn't do a thing at all
I'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on the concrete
Coppers try to kill me but they didn't know this was the wrong street
Bang bang, count another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot for his brutality
Who do you blame? It's a shame because the man's slain
He got caught in the chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?
Sweated me, hunted me, trapped in my own community
One day I'm gonna bust, blow up on this society
Why did you lie to me? I couldn't find a trace of equality
Worked me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that, it's time I let 'em suffer the payback
I'm tryin' to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped

[Chorus: Shock G & 2Pac]
Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now I'm trapped, and walkin' for my getaway
All I need is a G and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use the phone 'cause I'm sure someone is tapping in
Did it before, ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant
But now he's the Devil's friend, too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away, I should've put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin', all I heard was the ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup saying ""Damn homies is dissin' you""
I fired my weapon, started steppin' in the hurricane
I got shot, so I dropped feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet, couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley, still lookin' for my getaway
Copper say, ""Freeze, or you'll be dead today.""
Trapped in a corner, dark and I couldn't see the light
Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
What do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living Hell
They got me trapped

[Chorus: Shock G & 2Pac]
Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down
You know they got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped

Break 'em
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day

[Outro]
Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?

Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me, that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk, you better back up
Try and play the role and yo, the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up (C'mon!) c'mon, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling, jump up, touch the ceiling
Muggs lets the funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo, I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's ho
Feelin', funkin', amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
Than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle, bring your shotgun (Shotgun)
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

[Verse 3: Everlast]
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
It up, up and around, then buck, buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie, I'll wet ya
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin'
To hell with romancin'

Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette

Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back

A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
Baby got back!

[Bridge: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
""Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"".""

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

[Outro]
Baby got back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!

73,Don't Sweat The Technique,Don't Sweat The Technique,Eric B. & Rakim,1992-01-01,262800,58,"

[Hook]
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

[Verse 1]
Let's trace the hits and check the file
Let's see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass 'til MCs get weak
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep
'Cause when I speak, they freak to sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a President's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits with beats
Parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MCs wanna beef, then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique

[Hook]
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

[Verse 2]
They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped and wrecked
But researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to labs to observe 'em
They couldn't absorb 'em, they didn't deserve 'em
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens are swords
Letters put together from a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, formed with structure
Because of my culture, I'm equipped to construct the
Technical styles that'll be full of technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak, just seek
And peep the technique

[Hook]
Never sweat the technique

[Verse 3]
I speak indiscreet 'cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then complete the
Poem's physique, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old, techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new 'cause it's real
And in a while the style’ll have much more value
Classical, too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant, mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs
For all the years, you fought and sought the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique

[Hook]
Never sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

[Produced by J-Swift]

[Verse 1: Bootie Brown]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at 3 o' clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

[Chorus]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pa--

[Verse 2: SlimKid 3]
When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her nigga
But, all I can do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by

[Verse 3: Imani]
Time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside: she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man

[Chorus]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me

[Verse 4: Fatlip]
Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her
And it went, ""My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you
Very well now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you""
Then I signed ""Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender""
The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn

[Chorus]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pa--
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
Passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
(Nevertheless)
(Nevertheless)
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(I'll say it again)

75,They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.),Mecca And The Soul Brother,Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1992-05-26,286693,59,"

[Produced by Pete Rock]

[Intro]
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I reminisce, I reminisce
Uh! (I reminisce, I reminisce)
Yeah (I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
Twenty-two years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast, but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose you hope the little black boy grows
Huh, eighteen years younger than my mama
But I rarely got beatings 'cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood, there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first, but you don't give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not-thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma's gettin married and a house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother Queen's rising a chapter
Déjà vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Bridge 1: Pete Rock]
My God
It's so
Yeah, so lovely
That's how we like to do it in the 90's
Pete Rock & CL Smooth comin' atcha

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand Poppa Doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother
Taking care of this, so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
But you can never say that his life is through
Five kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese Lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough they live longer than us
Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
But give the man a taste and he's gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
I said pop maybe when you're older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing, yelling ""Good God Almighty""
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

[Bridge 2: Pete Rock]
For real, baby
Like that
We for real
Comin' atcha
In '92
Pete Rock & CL Smooth
Yeah, c'mon, hit me!

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of way-back, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R the O-Y, how did you and I meet?
In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes, in any weather
My Grandmom Pam holds the family together
My Uncle Doc's the greatest, better yet the latest
If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest
I strive to be live 'cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce
So Pete Rock hit me, 'nough respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

[Outro: Pete Rock]
Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that's word is bond
I'm not playin'
Everybody, just coolin'
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother
Trouble T-Roy
It's like that y'all
And you don't stop
Pete Rock and CL Smooth for '92
And we out, later

(Let's get ready to rumble)
In this corner we have the funk bodysnatcher
P-Funkadelic and I gat ya
Hard enough that I can chew a whole bag of rocks
Chew an avenue, chew an off street and off block
Then turn around and do the same damn thing to a soloist
'Cause Reggie Noble's pissed
I crush the whole brain frame
'Cause you couldn't maintain the funk
That have your rap style for lunch, chump
'Cause '92, I take a whole crew
Give them a punch of the funk
Knock all of their gold tooth loose (Pow)
To show you what type of stuff I'm on, you can't puff or sniff it
Because I was born with it
The Funkadelic Devil, hit you with the rap level of ten
Then one, two, three, you're pinned
I get action, so everybody jump wit' your rump
If you like the way it sounds punk, pump it in your back trunk
And let loose with the juice when I do rock
I'm too hot, some say I got more Juice than 2Pac
Straight outta Jersey
You heard me, my brother, I'm laughin'
Time for some action

Lights, camera, cock back the hammer (Explosion)
Straight from the Land of the Lost
I'ma hit you with the funk force
That make you run your rap style back to the crack aisle, brotha
Then strike a pose like Madonna
My mom's kicked me out because I did what I want ta
The original P-Funk, chump, dump a trunk of funk
In your skull caps 'cause my jaw snaps with the raw rap
So color me bad, plus color me black
For the funk that I pack, Red freak it to the funk track
(The funky fly stuff)
Come on and let me kick
(The funky fly stuff)
Just to show you where the hell I come from
I get dumb with the one, one, two
Check my rep from my hip when I have sex (Like this)
Make you twist to the list
Of a funky brain cell when it's puffed on a spliff
And all that, the hi hat, go buy that
Listen, look, oops, brother, where your eyes at?
They on the floor, pick 'em up
While I pour lyric funk down your brain, punk
Listen to my name, chump
(Redman ready to rock)
I got a Glock, then pow, your body is all over the block
Tryin' to step to this, the exorcist, kick it
I get mad wicked when Twin cock the biscuit
And blow your head off
Just for asking ""Who's the one rapping?"" (Poo-pow)

Here, have a dollar
In fact, no brotherman - here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you
Be strong, serve God only
Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused

Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal

Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize that all in all you stand tall

Mr. Wendal
Lord, Mr. Wendal

OK, I got it

(brothers and sisters)

[Verse One: Fatlip]
Ya mom is so fat (how fat is she?)
Ya mama is so big and fat that she can get busy
With twenty-two burritos, but times are rough
I seen her in the back of Taco Bell with handcuffs
The sad fact (what?) ya mama smokes crack (what?)
She got a burning yearning and there's no turning back
Her knuckles drag down to the ground when she walk
Spit comes out that bitch mouth when she talk

[Refrain]:
Naked on a mountain top, tootin on a flizoot
Ridin on a horse drinking whisky out a bizoot
She's got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
Ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
I said ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama

[Verse Two: Bootie Brown]
Ya mama look like she's been in the dryer with some rocks
With the big bust nose sucking dirt out of socks
Held up the ice cream truck with a slingshot
She grabbed a bag of Cheese Corn and a soda pop
Ya mama root'n'toot and stole my loot and my suit
She may have the muscles, but no, she's not cute
She's not pretty, oh what a pity, got the glass titty
Filled up with Kool-aid, just for the kiddies

[Refrain]
On a cliff butt naked, tootin on a flute
Ridin on a horse drinkin whisky out a boot
She's got the teeth and the wings of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Ya mama got the wooden legs with real feet
Ya mama got the wooden legs with real feet
I said Ya mama got the wooden legs with real feet
Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama

[Verse Three: Imani]
Watch out, I'm thinkin about your mother to a funky beat
I went to your house, and she licked me on the cheek
I said excuse me lady, but I remember seeing you at the Palladium
Way back in September
'Cause you was beatboxin for Lou Rawls
In some bright red boxer drawers
You said ya moms was pretty and young
But she's old as dirt and got hair on her tongue

Ya moms, ya moms, she uses Brut
Ridin on a horse drinkin whisky out a boot

[Verse Four: Slimkid3]
Awwwwwwww, ya mom is so fat (how fat is she?)
We rode up on her back to get some burgers from Wendy's
And her skates went flat; I got stuck in her butt crack
They thought I was lost but I was caught by the G-strap
Heaven forbid a giant fart would give way
'Cause that would blow me round the world in a day
We drove into the drive-in and she didn't have to pay
Because we dressed her up to look just like a Chevrolet

[Refrain]:
Naked on a mountain top tootin on a flizoot
Ridin on a horse drinkin whisky out a boot
With the wings and the teeth of an African bat, ba-aa-aa-at
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Ya mama's got an afro, with a chin strap
Ya mama's got an afro, with a chin strap
I said ya mama's got an afro, with a chin strap

Ya mama got snake skin teeth
Ya mama wears coat hangers for earrings , dude she looks like.... hehehe
Ya mama was making sex threats to Ricky Bell and shit
Ya mama jacked the Kool-aid man for a sip, nigga
Ya mama was walking down on Sunset with a 99 cent sign on her back
(You're a sellout) ya mama's a sellout nigga ya mama
Nigga ya mama did a pop tune nigga
Ya mama's glasses are so thick she look into a map
And see people wavin at her
Your mother got an Ouija board on her back
Sidney with EQ and everything what he be sayin
His mother be hooked, fishin with a hook and reel at the frozen food section
Tre's mama got Playdough teeth
Ya mother be eatin Daytons like Now and Laters and shit
Ya mama's an extra on the Simpsons and shit
Ya mama's so fat you can't even see her legs
It just looks like she's just gliding across the floor...

80,I'm A Swing It,Same As It Ever Was,House Of Pain,1994,223800,46,"

[Hook 1]
Flowing and flowing and just flowing [x10]

[Verse 1: Everlast]
I'm a swing it
Watch me bring it to the next level
The grafted devil's
Getting funky like The Neville
Brothers from the Bayou
So why you wanna trip?
Just play the sidelines, kid
And wait for me to slip
Cause I can feel it 'In the Air Tonight'
But yo I'm not Phil Collins
I'm more like Henry Rollins
Cause I ""Search and Destroy""
Every toy with a plot
Trying to get what I got
You might get shot!
Hot Damn! I'm a slam you like ONYX
Then teach you how to write a rhyme
Like Hooked on Phonics
Mother Goose ain't got shit on me
Cause I'll get loose at the jam
And wreck the whole party
I make 'em jump and mosh, oh my gosh
Just slamming in the pit
While I'm kicking my shit
They bugging in the aisles
Cause I got mad styles
And ain't a damn thing funny
I get money in piles
Some people thought I died
That's just a rumor though
Others thought I fell off
But now I'm Numero Uno
Dos, not Quatro
Word to Kool Keith
I'm a break up your teeth

[Interlude]
When I die (die)
Bury me (me)
Hang my balls from a cherry tree (tree)
Let them get ripe (ripe) then take a bite (bite)
And if they don't taste right
Then don't blame D! (D)

[Verse 2: Danny Boy]
You need to quit swinging
The style that I'm bringing
The funk-knuckled dragon
Who gets on the wagon
I'm not the twelve-stepper
Don't play me like a lever
""My Mic Sounds Nice""
But it's not Salt-N-Pepa

[Verse 3: Everlast]
Well it's the man with the plan to get all your skins
The tip on my dick's where the line begins
So hoes form a line
Take off that swine
Strip your ass buck-naked
Let's see if you can take it
Cause I'll make you feel
""Like A Natural Woman""
Cause I keep it coming
I'm the EverlastingFreestyle Assassin
With Soul and my goal
Is to bring a little passion
To your girl's life like the daily soaps
Throw her down on the bed and tie her up with ropes

[Hook 2]
The lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing
The lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing
The lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing
The lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing

[Verse 4: Danny Boy]
I'm just another Ranger with the Derry face
Punk motherfuckers beef about my race
You need step back, kid and give me some space
So I can cold-shock the party when I'm rocking the place
Danny Boy's arriving, standing six five and a half
Don't laugh, kid
The outlaw biker with my bitch hitchhiker
On the 'Highway to Hell'
Cause I never tell

[Verse 5: Everlast]
Well it's the funk backbreaker
We ""Heat it Up""  like Jamaica
Don't bring your woman to the party
Cause I'll take her
""Hit the Deck"" cause I'm down with the hooleys
I got a trunk full of funk like the Groovie Goolies
I'm not the man but I asked you ""Who was he?""
Quik's got the hairdo just like Ruth Buzzi
Running 'round town like you been to jail, son
But you hit the swap meet
To get your hair and your nails done
Get off my sack cause your shit is wack
You diss me and I'm a diss you back

[Hook 1 (x2)]

"
81,Back To The Grill,Return Of The Product,MC Serch,1992,303266,44,"

[Hook x6: All]
Back to the grill again, the grill again

[Verse 1: MC Serch]
You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this
And you're more optimistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip rhymes that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep goin' and goin' just like an Energizer battery
Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the derriere
And then it gets you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in my car, I parked it
Beef like blunts, if you got it, then spark it
And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined Steven Segal on the Marked for Death hit-list
Went back to the '70s and brothers got on grins
'Cause they can step to sisters and say ""Slap me some skins
Honeydip"", and take the squaw to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes, there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick 'em in the... grill

[Hook]

[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Word up! MC Serch, that was fly
We gonna try like this, though, um...

[Verse 2: Red Hot Lover Tone]
Bust a style while I do it, if you know it, oh, you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewin'
I'mma drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep, I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumpin' to it
So, so, so, where did you go, what do you know?
So many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh, lots and lots
And any rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)
R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop (Not!)
All my hoes look like Sasquatch (Not!)
And uh, George Bush gets enough props
Well, uh, anyway, I'mma slay, slay, lay
Pull a hoe around my way and make hooker soufflé
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for makin' me part of history
Kickin' 'em in the grill!

[Verse 3: Nas]
Finesser, keep a Tec-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep ya under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, the nightclub flirter
This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns
Stickin' up the preachers in the church, I'm a stoned crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book
For you, I got a lot to shoot and songs to hear
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with gonorrhea
On the mic, I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that, y'all!) That, y'all, kick 'em in the grill!

[Hook]

[Sample x2]
""Jump, jump, with the man, with the plan, Chubb Rock""

[Verse 4: Chubb Rock]
The Chubbsta breaks, head nods, he fakes, steady rate H
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of ""The Dialect, The Derelict""
The murder list, Vanilla kicks it to climb on the crucifix
Comin' around the mountain
When he comes to sell the record bumps
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're hummin'
The door rings, yo, I'm comin'
To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guinness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
'Cause YOU! are a BLABBERMOUTH!
A blabber, it gets no badder
Lyrics on a diet 'cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gwen to the Guthrien, jumpin' up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses, word up, the illustrious
Rapper, dapper, snapper fish, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo, kick me in the grill, grill

[Hook]

[Sample]
""So get up and get down""
""Serch'll never stand still""

[Verse 5: MC Serch]
So here's a true or false, tell me if it's fact or bull:
You wanna kill the Klan, shoot the fans at a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ayo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey
Or basketball, football, takin' papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip, I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill, chill, can't swing
'Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring
Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
Try the G, I'll put you in a tree just like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the ho
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio
'Cause I saw you eatin' pig knuckles, with Frankie Knuckles
In a club called Chuckles, wearin' name plate belt buckles
Goddamn, your life is flimsy
Gave you 'nuff respect, but took it back 'cause I was stingy
So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker, I'll say, ""Yeah, I fucked your moms""
Until she calls back, I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick 'em in the grill

82,How To Roll A Blunt,Whut? The Album,Redman,1992-01-01,201720,41,"

[Production by Redman & Pete Rock]

[Intro]
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww SHIT!!
Check it out
Yo, 1992 begins a new wave for the blunt rollers
You know what I'm sayin'?
The saga of the Phillie Blunt continues
The flava's the P-Funk y'all, get wit it
Check it out...

[Verse 1]
Check out a new type of gimmick which is splendid
Since you're down with other shit, let's see if you're down with this
It's about strictly trying to roll a blunt
When you get the hang of it, you'll carry more blunts than Archie Bunk'
First of all, you get a fat bag of ism
From Uptown, any local store sells the shit, friend
Purchase a Phillie—not the city of Philly, silly punk
I'm talking about the cigar, the Phillie Blunt
Lick the blunt and then the Phillie Blunt middle you split
Don't have a razor blade, use your fuckin' fingertips
Crack the bag and then you pour the whole bag in
Spread the ism around until the ism reach each end
Take your finger and your thumb from tip to tip
Roll it in a motion, then the top piece you lick
Seal it, dry it wit your lighter if ya gotta
The results, mmmmmmmm....proper

[Hook]
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up

(Peace to Pete Rock)
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
(Peace to Pete Rock)
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up, yeah

[Verse 2]
The second paragraph might makes you laugh
When a brotha rolls a blunt and his breath smells like pure ass
That's when you know you gotta take the blunt from him
'Cause his breath has the dragon in the dungeon
(Yo, yo, yo, light the blunt. uh yo, here's the lighter..)
I would if this shit would stop drippin' wit saliva
And if you gonna lick it, don't drown it with your spit, shit
I dunno what dick or last puss' you licked quick
And how 'bout the non-blunt rollin' females
That always fucks it up 'cause they don't wanna break their Lee nails
(hee hee hee hee hee, sorry Red for spilling it...)
[BEEEITCH] You better pickup every seed of it
Because I paid 10 bills for the get ill
And for spilling it, you better get lost or get grill
Bo know everything from sports to other stuff
But I bet you Bo don't know to roll a blunt

[Hook]
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up

That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up, yeah

(""Hey, nigga, pass the goddamn blunt. Shit! What you holding it all day for?)
Sit yo' big ass down...

[Outro]
Yo, yo, check this out
I want all the real niggas out there and the females too
If you got a fat blunt in ya mouth and you feeling high as hell
I want y'all to repeat after me, check it out
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up...)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up...)
I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell...)
I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell)
Yeah

Last but not least, Redman like to say peace
To all the blunt rollers from the Tri-State to the Middle East
And gimme a blunt when I kick the bucket
Devil or no devil, when high, I am the wrong one to be fucked with
So everybody, put they blunt up in the air
Take a puff, blow the smoke out like ya just don't care
So...(pump up the volume)...so it's heard thru the next block
I'm out, peace to Redd Foxx, I'm off to the cess spot...

Yeah, DJ Twinz in the house
Yeah, Redman's in the house
Yo, peace to Pack Pistol Posse, the 4,5,6
Yo, I'm out
Yo Reg, turn this shit off, man (Yo, turn that shit off...)

83,Don't Give Me No Bammer Weed,A Lesson to Be Learned,RBL Posse,1992-01-07,368533,47,"

[Intro: Black C & Mr. Cee]
Ayy, Mr. Cee, What's up nigga, you got 5 dollars on this gram?
Yeah, nigga, you know I'm fadin'!
Alright then, let's bounce to Cashmere
Alright
Ayy, what's up nigga? Ayy, who got weed?
Ayy, what you need?
Man I need that dank right, straight right, I can't fuck with none of that light, that shit that float
Man, all I hear is bammer

[Chorus: Black C]
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)

[Verse 1: Mr. Cee]
Three, two, one, coming in with a bang
It's two dark-skinned niggas, not a motherfuckin' gang
Pimps with limps never known as simps
We smoke dank, not the bammer shit
Damn, that bammer ain't no good
You might as well smoke some rolled up wood
And you laughed and said those rhymes was funny
But trip on the sense that I'm stressin', you punk-ass dummy
Get with the program (Program)
Can't you see bammer ain't nothin' but a scam?
A false high, nothin' but a untruth
A fib, or a everyday lie, too
Dank is the claim to fame
Ain't it a gram that you seek to gain?
Once knew a girl named Brenda
Smokin' that bammer was her everyday agenda
She used to laugh and giggle
Until Mr. Cee moved next to her building
I tried to get her, but she acted kinda shy
So I shared my dank, I got her real high
She invited me up to her room (My nigga)
And for you bitches, honey boom, honey boom
We smoked mo' dank without a pause
And later that night I was in them drawers
See, Frisco niggas ain't no punks
Put guts in our way and they're gonna get bucked
Oh, and Brenda's now hoeing in The Point
Couldn't handle the dank, the reason? Bammer joints

[Chorus: Black C]
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)

[Verse 2: Black C & Mr. Cee]
Don't give me no bammer joint
It's the Black C, nigga, gettin' straight to the point
I was chillin' outside on a hot day
It was me and my niggas, just check what I say
Let's fade, let's go see the dank man
They'll fade if they is my friend
A few niggas pitched in
Let's go to the store so I can get some gin
Oh no, straight Henn-dog on mine
With a little dab of Coke and a nigga doin' fine
So now we got a nitro
We up, yeah, let's go get the indo
In four deep we creep
It's about to be a party in the 5.0 Jeep
Nigga straight checkin' the mirror
One nigga in the back had a St. Ides beer
Hurlin' like fuck in my backseat
I made him buy five grams and clean up the mess, G
Straight Henn-dog with no chaser
Fuck that beer, ain't nothin' greater
A-B, our name C
And you gotta pause when you get to the D
D for dank, D for drank
But not D for the dope, that's stackin' my bank
There's only two things that I smoke
A punk-ass nigga or a pipe full of indo
I like nothin' but the real McCoy
Straight dank, fuck a bammer joint

[Chorus: Black C]
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)

[Verse 3: Black C & Mr. Cee]
Is it gold, is it green, is it brown? (Brown)
No, it's Black C breaking them buds down
Or should I say them indo clusters
Never want homegrown 'cause I'm a indo lover
Trip on the shit that I say
Or go take a trip to go get the shit
D to the A to the N to the K
Niggas know what's up, so what more can I say?
If it's in a Zag or a pipe
It's quite expensive, so you better smoke it right
Get a few niggas to fade
Find a cut, or just zurp in the shade
And like meat belongs to a meal
Grab a 40 with the dank cause it's time to get ill
It's better than crack cocaine
It ain't medicine, but it'll ease the pain
And if you find, right you're in luck
That and the Ides got you amped as fuck
Now for the journey or quest
And creepin' for some sex but don't forget the latex
Niggas like each other lesser and lesser
But on the dank tip, let's come together
You call it herb, some call it sess
But if it's called bammer, don't smoke that mess

[Chorus: Black C]
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)

[Verse 4: Mr. Cee]
Once again it's the muthafuckin Mr. Cee
From Harbor Road, G
Just gimme a couple of Zig-Zags
So I can roll a fat one and take a drag
Now I ain't got no time for playin'
I just wanna smoke my dank, and
Niggas always sayin' smoke that bammer
But what's that word by MC Hammer?
Shit, it ain't 'proper'
The nigga who sold it to ya gotcha
Straight up gaffled
Now you're looking confused, or should I say baffled
But don't let it kill ya
'Cause a Hunters Point nigga who sold it to ya
The smoke gets straight to the head
And next you're put head to bed
Then you start to dreamin, wonderin'
You say to yourself (Damn, that dank was bumpin)
Ooh, ah, look at that ho
But don't open that door and let the contact blow
Nigga say that while rollin' in a ride
At the same time, listen to the bassline
By T.C and my nigga named Black C
Poem like D-O-P-E
Sayin' fresh rhymes for the RBL Posse
Expialidocious-califragilistic-super
Boy, I said it backwards, can I come smoother?
That's that dank shit
Time to pull another lick
RBL to the ninjas
Our mission, to go and jack niggas
For their indo sacks, to be exact
We took it like straight macks
See, we got straight to the point
'Cause we don't smoke no bammer joints

[Chorus: Black C]
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
Don't gimme no bammer weed (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (Get with the program, just smoke that dank)

84,Know The Ledge,Don't Sweat The Technique,Eric B. & Rakim,1992-01-01,238866,46,"

[Produced by Eric B]

[Verse 1]
Sip the juice, I got enough to go around
And the thought takes place Uptown
I grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk
And then taught to hawk New York
I go to Queens for queens, then get the crew from Brooklyn
Make money in Manhattan and never been tooken
Go Uptown in The Bronx to Boogie Down
Get Strong on the Island, recoup and lay around
Time to build my juice back up
Props stack up, suckers get smacked up
Don't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Shakin' 'em up, wakin' 'em up
Breakin' 'em up, rakin' 'em up
Standin' on shaky ground too close to the edge
Let's see if I Know the Ledge

[Verse 2]
Corner's triflin' 'cause shorty's here
I get cock-D liftin' forties of beer
Here's a sip for the crew that's deceased
If I get revenge, then they rest in peace
Somebody gotta suffer, I just might spare one
And give a brother a fair one
Stay alert and on P's and I do work with these like Hercules
Switch to southpaw, split your right jaw
'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall
Smooth but I move like an army
Bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me
Puttin' brothers to rest like Eliot Ness
'Cause I don't like stress
Streets ain't the place for innocent bystanders to stand
Nothing's gonna stop the plan
I'll chill like Pacino, kill like DeNiro
Black Gambino, die like a hero
Livin' on shaky grounds, too close to the edge
Let's see if I Know the Ledge

[Verse 3]
Shells lay around on the battleground
Dead bodies are found throughout the town
Try to put shame in my game to make a name
I'mma put it on a bullet, put it in your brain
Rip the block like a buckshot
Who cares where it goes? Just keep the casket closed
No remorse when a life is lost
I paid my dues, paid the cost
And my pockets are still fat
Wherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat
Even if my crew asleep, I'm one deep
I attract attention, people like to peep
So come say hi to the bad guy
Don't say goodbye, I don't plan to die
'Cause I get loose and I got troops, and crazy juice
In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini
Hang out with Smith and Wess', don't try to play me
I'm at war a lot, like Anwar Sadat
But no warnin' shot, my gun is warm a lot
When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear
Areas in fear 'cause this here's severe
Livin' life too close to the edge
Hopin' that I Know the Ledge

[Verse 4]
A brand new morn', no time to yawn
Shower's on, power's on
Late for school, I catch the train
Girls sip the style and whisper my name
I push up like an exercise
Check they intellect and inspect the thighs
Select the best one, pull her to the side
Keep her occupied for the rest of the ride
Read her my résumé, she know already? Cool
Just meet me after school
We can moan and groan until your moms come home
And you'll be callin' me Al ""Dope"" Capone
Sweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose
Come get me, that's if you want to sip the juice
'Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety
'Cause a lot of niggas hate me
Comin' out of the building, they set me up
Sprayed with automatics, they wet me up
In a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge
I guess I didn't Know the Ledge

85,Tennessee,"3 Years, 5 Months And 2 Days In The Life Of...",Arrested Development,1992-03-24,272706,52,"

[Verse 1: Speech]
Lord, I've really been real stressed
Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin' up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)
But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

[Chorus]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Verse 2: Speech]
Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talking to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree, my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

[Chorus]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Interlude: Aerle Taree]
Eshe, she went down to Holly Springs
Rasadon and Baba, they went down to Peachtree
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes, a game of horseshoes

[Verse 3: Speech]
Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

[Chorus]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Outro: Aerle Taree]
Headliner, I won the game of horseshoes
Now you owe me a watermelon
Let's go climb trees and skip over rocks
Do like they do below the border
Speech's hair
Don't it look like the roots of the tree that the ancestors were hung from
But that's okay, get it cause he's down to Earth

And Now I'd Like To Introduce (What's up?)
I'll Pass The Mic To D. For A Fist Full Of Truth

And Like Jimmy Walker I'm ""Dynomite""
And Now I'd Like To Pass The Mic
To Adrock C'mon And Do Anything You Like

And If You Think That You're Slick You'll Catch A Brick Y'All
'Cause I'm A Turn It In And I'm A Turn It Out
But Now I Got To Pass The Mic To Yauch

I Can't Stop Y'All 'Til The Early Morn'
So Rock Rock Y'All Tick Tock Y'All
To The Beat Y'All C'mon And Rock Y'All

I Give Thanks For Inspiration
It Guides My Mind Along The Way
A Lot Of People Get Jealous, They're Talking About Me
But That's Just 'Cause they haven't got a thing to say

Well, Everybody's Rapping Like It's A Commercial
Actin' Like Life Is A Big Commercial
So This Is What I've Got To Say To You All
Be True To Yourself And You Will Never Fall
And Now I'd Like To Pass The Mic To The A
So What's Your Name, Yauch? My Name Is M.C.A

And Now I'd Like To Pass The Mic
To My Brother Adrock C'mon And Shine Like A Light

Yes Yes Y'All And Yes Yes Y'All

And That's Right Y'All, I Shed Light Y'All
I've Got No Time In My Life To Get Uptight Y'All

So What You Gonna Say That I Don't Know Already?
I'm Like Clyde And I'm Rockin' Steady
But Time Flies When You're Having Fun
So Mike D - That's Me - C'mon And Get Some

Let's Rock This Joint In The Old School Way

Well I'm On till The Crack Of Dawn
Mowing Down M.C.'s Like I'm Mowing A Lawn
I Go Off Like Nothing Can Phase Me

But I Can Stand My Ground And I Am Down
To Wax An M.C. Who Acts Like A Clown
But For Now, I'd Like To Ask You How
You Like The Feel Of The Bass In Your Face In The Crowd

87,Top O' the Morning to Ya,House of Pain (Fine Malt Lyrics),House Of Pain,1994-07-21,216319,47,"

""She won't come, just when you want it..""

[Verse 1: Everlast]
Ya see I'm Irish, but I'm not a leprechaun
You wanna fight, then step up and we'll get it on
You'll get a right to the grill, I'm white and I ill
A decendant of Dublin with titanic skill
I ducked and I swing, next thing your jaw's broken
Punk I ain't jokin', you can bet you'll be chokin'
On a fist full of nuttin, meanwhile I'll be puffin'
On a fat blunt, what punk? You don't know the half
Tryin' to talk shit, man, please don't make me laugh
These Irish eyes are smilin', I'm buckwhylin'
The House of Pain is pumpin', start jumpin'
Freak it, funk it, back seat trunk it
If you can't get with it, you'll wind up sweatin' it
Then you'll get a beatin' just like an egg
It's so hard to run when you got a broken leg
But we can have a run off, the House of Pain'll come off
We got the cake that you're tryin to get a crumb off
The Irish stylee, the Celtic jazz
No one has it, just us, that's it
If you try to take it, I got a big shillelagh
I don't have dreads cause I shave my head daily
You call me a skinhead, I call you a pin head
Yo, where you been man, just like the Tin Man
You got no heart, here comes the good part
I pick 'em, buck 'em, cut 'em up, and buck 'em down
No fuckin' around, homeboy ya get clowned like Krusty
Trust me, you shouldn't play.. and by the way

[Hook: Everlast + ""Cheech and Chong"" scratches]

Top o' the mornin to ya.. ""What's the hassle man?""
Top o' the mornin to ya.. ""What's the hassle man?""
Top o' the mornin to ya.. ""What's the hassle man?""
Top o' the mornin to ya..
""Hey, are you givin us a hassle man?""

[Verse 2: Everlast]
Greetings, salutations
Peace to the Nations of Zulu and Islam
Crack a bottle, rev the throttle
Put the gear in, now you're steerin'
Like Mario Andretti, so let me kick it
Cause I can make a wicked noise like a cricket
Rubbin' his legs, my rhymes are like eggs
Allah'll keep layin' em, I'll keep sayin' em
This is the House of Pain, we're far from plain
But we're not fancy, Ron and Nancy
So ""Just Say No,"" but I say go
Straight to Hell, I kiss and tell
So if you're a ho, all my friends know
What you gotta say? Let's hit the hay
And have no delay, and yo, by the way..

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Everlast]
Extra extra, read all about it
How could ya doubt it? Now scream and shout it!
The House of Pain, soon will reign
Over the Hip-Hop scene in white gold and green

[Verse 4: Danny Boy]
I rip shit and backflip like a Jedi
I roll with the groove and I'm smooth and you can bet I
Come correct and get respect when I'm flowin'
Collectin' my dough, I got you're girlfriend hoein
And how do I know that she's sprung?
I know she's sprung cause yo, the D's hung.. like a
Shetland pony, gettin' paid like Sony
So never ever try to play me out like a phony
Cause I can get real thick like a bowl of Malt-O-Meal
And by the way..

88,Otha Fish,Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde,The Pharcyde,1992-11-24,321506,51,"

[Intro: SlimKid3 + Bootie Brown]
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, heyya, whassup, yeah
We was like that you know
Yeah, and I bet you got laid back
Yeah, I'mma uh, I'm a just sit in here for a couple of hours
Man, don't sweat it, yo, we gonna catch some stuff, dude
Oh no, I'm kinda tired
Nah, we got a basket, we're gonna fill this basket before we go, yo
Aight, bro
'Cause the otha fish is better...

[Verse 1]
It took a second to register up in my branium
My dome, my head, my skull, my cranium
My eyes have had enough, it was time to do some talking
I had to creep through the hound-dogs that were stalking
This slimmy caught me peeping
This means she wasn't sleeping on who I was
So she crept in like a hawk
In a minute's time, we adjourned to the floor
Ooh! I hit a high note 'cause of the way that she was walking
We got into the groove, I didn't bust no, uh, hip-hop moves
I just kept it nice and smooth
Next thing you know, we got together, word, I thought we'd be forever
Didn't have an umbrella, now I'm soaked in stormy weather
Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together
Never simp, pimp, and leave your love life limp
There'll be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid
'Cause you know there's other fish in the sea, that is, in the sea
In the sea that is

[Chorus]
In the sea
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
You know there's other fish in the sea

[Verse 2]
I reminisce, try to clear up all the myths
For an imaginary kiss with you again
Not even friends, though I wish that I could mend
Like a tailor and be Olive Oyl's number one sailor
I ams what I am, still I falls like an anvil
She's heavy on the mind, sometimes it's more than I can handle
But men aren't supposed to tumble into the den, B
Macho, but a honcho like Pancho will give in
Family oriented, but not Oriental
A dame is supposed to claim ya even if you drive a Pinto
A hero is a sandwich, and a Manwich is a meal
A marriage is a paper; are they fakin' or for real?
What's the deal, dabbers? Will you go tumbling after
Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
The reason why I ask you is because I'm sick of this
Bitch licking drip drip from a nigga's benefits
He doesn't even suit you and he's surely not your size
I'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide
And when ya open up your eyes, babe, my mate, I really wish
That you don't bruise a limb, as you swim with other fish in the sea
In the sea that is

[Chorus]
In the sea
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
You know there's other fish in the sea

[Verse 3]
Now, if there ain't no mountain high enough
Why ain't you climbing up?
My hand has been extended ever since the day I lent it to ya
I thought I knew ya, but I didn't even know ya
Bro, you're stupid, 'cause ya thought you captured Cupid
And you found that love ain't two bits of shit
So I resign and quit
It ain't even about the hips, or the lips or the tits or
Even the pussy whip, Elizabeth, this is it
Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didn't fit
And now the next man is stealing my heart away
I'd charge him like a bull, but his pull never fades me
The kid is going crazy, they stepping with my lady
They're working on a baby, I'm pushing up the daisies, but
Hey diddle diddle, I won't play second fiddle
To no man and stand firm on this
And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss
Just call me Big Gibraltar, miss
No, I won't diss, I'm just like off to other fish in the sea

[Outro]
In the sea, baby
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea

You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea

You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea

You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea
You know there's other fish that's in the sea

[Over Chorus]
You know there's other, you know that there's other

In the sea, baby
In the sea, baby
In the sea, baby
In the sea, baby

89,A Lesson to Be Learned,A Lesson to Be Learned,RBL Posse,1992-01-07,244093,41,"

[Intro]
(I'm tired of this muthafuckin' shit)
(I'm tired of this muthafuckin' shit)

[Verse 1: Black C]
Hip-hop on a muthafuckin' jock
It's the Black C, nigga, and I rock nonstop
With the Frisco crew and suckas are losin'
Fuckin' wit' me you'll catch a steel toe boot and
Right to the jaw, my crew is straight raw
RBL, that's Ruthless By Law
That's my muthafuckin' posse, and niggas wanna pop me
But stop me, pop me, and your hoes still jock me
Like a rabbit to a carrot, a dog to a bone
The big 9-deuce, I got it goin' on
'Cause hoes on my nutsack, my money stack is kinda fat
I didn't have to pull a jack to get where a nigga at
I laid down, stayed down, always kept a nine around
'Cause when you sell crack, dopers come in funny crowds
Tweakin', geekin', none of them are speakin'
And when they come around, make sure they ain't sneakin'
Right up on your back, you know they need crack
And they don't have no money? Watch out for the jack
But the tables have turned, and your ass got burned
So punk muthafucka, there's a lesson to be learned

[Interlude: Mr. Cee]
Yeah, Chris, you know niggas can't dig a pig
So why don't you drop some more of that shit
About these punk police out here in Frisco
Know what I'm sayin'? Bust that shit

[Verse 2: Black C]
Verse two goes out to the police
Fuckin' wit' me, now your ass got beef
See, you started some static, you silly ass rabbit
Jackin' in my hood like a muthafuckin' bad habit
Diggin' through my pockets like muthafuckin' Dig-Dug
I guess I'm a nigga that you wanna get rid of
It seems that way in my muthafuckin' hood
All you punk police always up to no good
Comin' through sweatin' while we tryna get out gurp on
Fuckin' up our highs and we're sitting in a drug zone
But ya done did this the last time to me, see
Now I'm gonna gather up my muthafuckin' posse
Them crazy ass niggas, the crazy ass crew
Them crazy muthafuckas with the steel toe boots
I'm gettin' my matches, I'm grabbin' my gasoline
And blowing that police station to smithereens
'Cause I don't play, I'm strapped with my AK
Sendin' you blue suits straight to your grave
So police, you can burn baby burn
'Cause the tables have turned and you've got on my last nerves
Lessons and suggestions is what a nigga's stressin'
So watch out, chief, 'cause your boys got beat!

[Verse 3: Mr. Cee]
Check this muthafuckin' shit out (Get down, get down)
Dumpin' on the mic is the nigga Mr. Cee
Comin' outta Frisco, RBL is my Posse
Standin' on Harbor tryna sell all my crack sacks
Stress on my mind, from thinkin' “Will I get jacked?”
But if you scared, go to church
'Cause ain't no fear in my heart, I'm still yellin' “Work”
Niggas tryna run wild, thinkin' they on hit
Gettin' too greedy get you gaffled in the mix
Gettin' popped by the cops not knowing where you're goin'
Wit' a sack in your nuts, hopin' and then sure to get
Thrown in a paddy wagon with all type of agents
Or some get killed in high-speed chases
Now you sittin' in court without givin' up a fight
Got sent to the pen, doin' 10 to 25
Some say it ain't worth it
But I gotta go trick so my pockets won't be hurtin'
So get back! Get back! Get back!
If you real to the game, then you know I'm kickin' facts
Yeah, there's money to be earned
But take notes on what you see
'Cause there's a lesson to be learned

[Outro]
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
There's a lesson to be learned
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
Yeah bitch, there's a lesson to be learned
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
Frisco
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
There's a lesson to be learned
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
Hunters Point, here's a lesson to be learned
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
Swampy D, there's a lesson to be learned
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
Fillmore, there's a lesson to be learned
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
The whole muthafuckin' Bay Area, there's a lesson to be learned
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
There's a lesson to be learned
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
There's a lesson to be learned
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
There's a lesson to be learned
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew
San Francisco Police Department, there's a lesson to be learned
(Get your boots bent)
Bitch, I thought you knew; bitch, I really thought you knew (Ha, ha, ho)

[Chorus: Repeat 4X]
""I'm rated R, this is a warning""
""Boy you can't fuck with me!!""

[Verse 1: Redman]
Nah nah nah, fuck that!
Don't hold me back, the Funkadelic Devil just snapped
With a rap, that's shittin on the story of Jack Sprat
So put your money where your mouth is
Watch Redman house shit
And if it's beef, I'll punch you in your mouth, kid ('Damn!')
I got a heart but my heart is made out of nails
Word to Jamelle, my heart pumps nails in my blood rail
I'm not a warrior or barbarian type of nigga
I'm just quick to smoke your family then fuck your sister
That's what type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Been thinkin' about playing that nice guy role at heaven door
'Cause ever since I was an infant I was different
Paid no attention to my moms when she riffed-ed
I was a hardheaded mother-eff, but had to step
'Cause she hit me with a left, then another left
That's why my brain is out of order
Because it takes just a quarter to manslaughter your little daughter
And do a driveby—fuck that, I walk by and I spray shit
Then carve my name in your pavement
I was Rated 'X' but I flexed
I beat up the devil with a shovel so he dropped me a level
Ain't that ill? That I could just stand and watch a bloodspill
From a known rapper, but now the rapper's no frill
Just because I made a record I'm a star, that's bullshit
What's the flavor, Tame? (Fuck what you heard, this rated R)

[Chorus: Repeat 4X]
""I'm rated R, this is a warning""
""Boy you can't fuck with me!!""

[Verse 2]
Back to part two of the segment, the Red bend
Mics of all types, pour beer out for my dead friends
And if I didn't know ya, to hell witcha punk
And tell the devil I'll be in time for lunch (heh heh heh heh)
Got Naughty in my Nature plus I'm down with O.P.P
The best part about it, I got AIDS, bitch!
Psych, I'm only kiddin, only do it to ugly women
'Cause the pretty one's puss' smell like they went fishin
I grab my dick with a tight grip 'cause I might flip
(Yo Red, kick that hype shit on who you had a fight with!)
I had a fight with Chuck, the punk motherfuck
Tried to stab me in the gut, so I dazed him with an uppercut (BING!)
Snapped the neck on Michael Myers then I freaked it
'Cause it was August and he was talkin this trick or treat shit (Trick or treat!)
Jason my man slangs rocks like up the block
143rd and Amsterdam by the smoke shop
Norman Bates work the night shift late
Since he dresses like his mama, I pimp him and his hoecake
Bust a maneuver, Freddy Krueger
Dreamed about me havin' him scooped up
He woke up with his dukes up
That caused me to cut the hands off the man with the chainsaw
Plus I got his brain pickled in a jar
So let's get down with the funk break, 'cause they tailgate
My rap style, so to cut 'em off, I truncate
And rough 'em up, tough 'em up, like bust 'em up
With the one-two punch, like serving a customer
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I know, from me, THE original P-Funk
See ya next LP, chump!

[Verse 1]
You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me drop her cuz it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelicts
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my Beemer goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the 90's is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Now I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I'm still gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field cuz I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm on with the next girl

[Hook]
(Sample x6) Cuz girls look so good
Next x5

[Verse 2]
She had much loot, liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near cuz of my savoir faire
The time we shared was brief cuz I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She whines and she pouts about how I did her bad, yo
But she tried to buy me
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec cuz the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look yo, I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, nuff respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm straight with the next girl

[Hook]
(Sample x4) Cuz girls look so good
Next x3

[Verse 3]
You saw my moms in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked her how's my sister then asked her how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father cuz you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darling was fly and this was the problem
Cuz back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and who, me? I just bugged
Caught in between feeling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, and find another
Been in Brooklyn 9 years and been around the world, too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex- to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
I went home to see my moms and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? Nah, I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl & I'm out with the next girl
Out...

93,We Had To Tear This Mothafucka Up,The Predator,Ice Cube,1992-11-17,263933,42,"

[Intro: Ice Cube & Sample]
""Peace, quiet and good order will be maintained in our city to the best of our ability. Riots, melees and disturbances of the peace are against the interests of all our people and therefore, cannot be permitted.""
(""The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty..."")
""We've been told that all along Crenshaw Boulevard, that there's a series of fires. A lot of looting is going on. A disaster area, obviously.""
(""The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty..."")
Make it rough!
(""A lot of activity continues here at this command post."")
[Cube] Make it rough!
(""We have sporadic fires, throughout the city of Los Angeles."")

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Not guilty, the filthy, devils tried to kill me
When the news get to the hood the niggas will be
Hotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust
Kickin up dust is a must
I can't trust, a cracker in a blue uniform
Stick a nigga like a unicorn
Born, wicked, Laurence, Powell, foul
Cut his fuckin throat and I smile
Go to Simi Valley and surely
Somebody knows the address of the jury
Pay a little visit, ""Who is it?"" (Ohh it's Ice Cube)
""Can I talk to the grand wizard,"" then boom!!
Make him eat the barrel, modern day feral
Now he's zipped up like Leather Tuscadero
Pretty soon we'll catch Sergeant Koon
Shoot him in the face, run up in him with a broom-
-stick, prick, devils ain't shit
Introduce his ass to the AK-40 dick
Two days niggas layed in the cut
To get some respect, we had to tear this muthafucka up!

[Hook: Ice Cube & Sample]
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
Make it rough!
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
I got a Mac-10 for Officer Wind
Damn, his devil ass need to be shipped back to Kansas
In a casket, crew cut faggot
Now he ain't nothing but food for the maggots
Lunch, punch, Hawaiian, lying
Niggas ain't buying, ya story, bore me
Tearing up shit with fire, shooters, looters
Now I got a laptop computer
I told you it would happen, and you heard it, read it
But all you can call me was anti-Semitic
Regret it? Nope, said it? Yep
Listen to my big black boots as I step
Niggas had to break you off something, give Bush a push
But your National Guard ain't hard
You had to get Rodney to stop me, 'cause you know what?
We woulda to' this muthafucka up!

[Hook: Ice Cube & Sample]
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
Make it rough!
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
Ayy Muggs, make it rough!
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
It's on, ""Gone With the Wind""
And I know white men can't dunk, now I'm stealing blunts
And a cake from Betty Crocker, Orville Reddenbacher
Don't fuck with the black-owned stores, but hit the Foot Lockers
Steal, motherfuck Fire Marshall Bill
Oh, what the hell? Throw the cocktail, I smell smoke
Got the fuck out, Ice Cube lucked out
My nigga had his truck out, didn't get stuck out
In front of that store with the Nikes and Adidas
Oh Jesus, Western Surplus got the heaters
Meet us, so we can get the 9's and the what-nots
Got the Mossberg with the double-eyed buckshot
Ready for Darryl, and like Baretta would say
Keep your eye on the barrel, a sparrow
""Don't do the crime if you can't do the time""
But I'm rolling, so that's a fucked-up slogan
The Hogan's, Heroes, spotted the guerilla
By the Sizzler, hitting up police killer
The super-duper nigga that'll buck
We had to tear this muthafucka up, so what the fuck!?!

[Hook: Ice Cube & Sample]
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
Huh, make it rough!
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
Yo Muggs, make it rough
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
Huh, make it rough
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
Enough!
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""
""Wrong nigga to fuck with!""

94,Straighten It Out,Mecca And The Soul Brother,Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1992-05-26,253413,47,"

[Intro: Pete Rock]
Uh, yeah. Uh-huh
We got Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth
And we're here to tell you to...
And that's a fact, baby
Now you're gonna kick some lyrics
Like this, c'mon...

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
Walk the fine chalk line, and put the needle to the grind
Representin' one kind, seeing eye for the blind
Witness what I carry on bears a further purpose
From how we do slam a few, then you want to purchase
A dialogue of funk, you love to pop it in your trunk
I win, more disciplined than a Shaolin monk
Pete Rock and C.L., well set to spark it
The powerful target to destroy the black market
But when you say black, listen, I don't know, you lose me
I guess another beggar can't afford to be choosey
I come to the maximum, artist on a major label
Any duplication of this one is fatal
On one two five, I gotta hit ya live
Beat your ass with my tape, any race or shape
Cuz if they got mine, they got yours too
But together here's what we gotta do

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Tell 'em... straighten it out
Ah, yeah... straighten it out
You know this is the word (say what?)... straighten it out
That's right y'all... straighten it out (say what?)
You got to... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out... yeah
Straighten it out... it's like that (say what?)

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
The funk legacy I pass on, clearancy for high rates
Every time we sample all the past time greats
Stick it in the SP-1200 beat, I make a loop
Lovely, way to troop in a Lexus coupe
Just a little bit, set to make a whole lot happen
The musical inside my rappin'
Written by the C.L., produced by the P.R
And add in any credit that you heard thus far
I start from scratch, cuz the bassline's critical
Better than the original who first made it
Now you want to sue me, but fans never boo me
Believe I know the times, we been broke, too, G
Here's another sample clear, see ya, get the hell outta here
Like a bootleg, you're over for the year
You'll only get the credit where the credit is due
So, listen, what I shout out is true

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Yeah, true... straighten it out
You gots to tell 'em to... straighten it out
(Say what?)... straighten it out
You got to tell 'em to... straighten it out
(Say what?)... straighten it out
That's right... straighten it out
C'mon (say what?)... straighten it out
That's right... straighten it out
Straighten it out (say what?)

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Like the strands of lamb's wool, I'm thinkin' that's said
Here to go to the head and count the locks on a dred
I and I'd 'mit to verify, goin' to multiply
A theory many thought a conspiracy
Here to let you know that it applies to all of us
You're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus
Cause who Jah bless, let no one curse
Straighten out what I be about, reckon above the clout
And let the management work for me
Because I don't need the unnecessary hostility
A proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough
Straighten it out, so everybody know
The kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface
Kickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous
We're finally here and very long overdue
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
You gotta... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
You gotta... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out... you got to
Straighten it out... c'mon (say what?)
Straighten it out
All black people must... straighten it out
Say what?

[Outro: Pete Rock]
Straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out
The YG's, they must... straighten it out
The Hilltop, they must...straighten it out
The whole money-earnin' must... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out
Come on... straighten it out
Ah, yeah... straighten it out (to close)

95,Oh Shit,Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde,The Pharcyde,1992-11-24,269533,50,"

[Intro]
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit

[Verse 1: Slimkid3]
Little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer
Oh, how I tossed that ass up
Like a mission in the woods, Woody Woodpecker would
If he could, but I didn't wanna pass it up
To the next man, had my Walkman bumpin'
On the fifty yard line and my adrenaline pumpin'
Like a killer thriller, driller tiller, out with the Miller brew
Fill 'er up, took it 'til the damn Dutch puked
Luke Skywalker ain't a sweet talker, so I got ill
With my lightsaber that came in one fancy flavor
My strange behavior led to an outburst
The night felt good, but the day got worse
I thought I was alone, Slim Tre the stowaway
With a brown-eyed bombshell that was dope enough to pay
I looked over my shoulder and my cover was peeled
By my whole school saying, ""Ooh,"" and I'm busted for real
(He came and went at the same time)

[Chorus]
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit

[Verse 2: Imani]
What to say the least
I'm so slick that they need to call me Grease
'Cause I slips and I slides
When I rides on the beast
Imani and your mom, sittin' in a tree
K-I-S-S (I-N-G)
Yo, first comes the tongue, and then comes the she
My homey's M-O-M, what? (M-I-E)
Yo, and to think to day one
In my eyes, I show fear
'Cause I stepped into his house
His Mom's grinnin' ear-to-ear
Gigglin' and winks for weeks
I would encounter from this female
She's sizin' me up for the kill
""Oh, what the hell,"" is what I said to myself
So that I wouldn't worry
I'm sittin' on the couch
And wish Greg would please hurry, what? (Up)
She offered me a cup of Ripple
Broke out the titty, squeezed her nipple
Said, ""Suck it if you like, but please don't bite it""
I had an urge to say fuck it, but I knew I had to fight it
Before I could say alakazam carpet mow
I took this old bitch in the doggie style
Greg walked in the room, that nigga cold had a fit
But all this numbskull could say was, ""Oh shit!""

[Chorus]
(What's the matter, mama?)
Oh shit, oh shit
(What's the matter, mama?)
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh sh—
(Son of a bitch)
(Son of a bitch, come on!)

[Verse 3: Fatlip]
One fine summertime, Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin' in a purple Samurai Suzuki
Dookie braids was the aid to her sex appeal
Dude, she was dope!
Man, real dope, on the real
Well anyway, I went, ""Toot toot""
She said, ""Hey, beep beep""
The next day, rolled down to the beach
Tuesday, me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin' on my booty
Suck-suck-suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular (Why?)
'Cause every time I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like, ""Quit, hehe""
Bitch was frontin', but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of a sudden, after someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feets was real long
Then it hit me, oh please god, no
Don't let this ho turn out to be a John Doe
He pulled a fast one on me, yo
I guess that's one of those things that make you go

[Outro]
Shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit
Oh shit, oh shit....

96,What's On Your Mind,Don't Sweat The Technique,Eric B. & Rakim,1992-01-01,331826,38,"

[Verse 1]
I seen her in the subway, on my way to Brooklyn
Hello, good lookin', is this seat tooken?
On the A-train, picking at her brain
I couldn't get her number, I couldn't get her name
(I'm curious) I said I still like your style of fashion
But I hate your high saddity attitude with a passion
Is it because brothers like to hawk a lot?
Is it because you're shy'n don't talk a lot?
She turned away, no play, I said okay
You don't really look good, I hope you have a bad day
Sat back, relaxed though the ride was tight
I was thinking of the rhymes I wrote last night
Next stop was mine, a familiar scene
I was meeting my friend, Killer Ben in Fort Greene
Where the girls are real, they tell ya how they feel
If you're soft, you're soft, or if you're hard like steel
See I don't bend and I won't rust
And I don't break and I won't bust
Stomped up the street and did I hear a treat?
Hard high heels tappin' on the concrete
I took a peek, it was the girl from the train behind me
Did she live in the area, was she trying to find me?
Hmm, I didn't wanna play myself out
I played it off, stopped and I bought a Guinness Stout
Now was she shy, she didn't walk by
She came in the store then she even said 'hi'
Curiosity, at a high velocity
Maybe possibly she had the hots for me
I said, ""if we're playing games then we're gonna play mine
I'm a lay the rules 'cause it ain't much time
If you hide your feelings, and they hard to find
I wanna know what's on your mind""

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
About a week went by and I called her, ""Hello""
I said yo, can I speak to, um, she said no
Hey yo, I know I didn't call, I didn't wanna stress you
Go out my way to impress you, press to undress you
See I wanna get to know you so I can show you
What a strong relationship can grow to
But you gotta trust me and you're gonna love me
Squeeze the phone and hug me, use your mind to rub me
Now how does it feel
When my mental, massage ya temple
Telephone's hot from the vibes that I sent you
Now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions
Next you see ecstacy's explosions
Now I'm coming to see you to spend some time
I'm a romantic warrior, but is it a crime
And if you hide your feelings and they hard to find
I wanna know what's on your mind

[Hook]
I wanna know what's on your mind

[Verse 3]
Now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely
I'm in your head so you'll be thinking of me
So we met in Queens and went to Valley Streams
And, uh, couldn't remember the movie we just seen
But it's Wednesday, take the train uptown
How do the 125th street sound
Amateur night, Showtime at the Apollo
Probably be watching Bill Cosby tomorrow
Then after that get into it, I mean intimate
Every word is an instrument
Making sounds and tones and songs and moans
My lips so close to your ear, it's like headphones
You smile, you said you never know what the day will bring
It's always a new song to sing
The next day I went back to her rest
Knocked on the door, intentions: finesse
She let me in and had nothing but a negligee on
Smelling like Liz Claiborne
I sat down and got comfortable and watched the Huxtables
She sat next to me and said what's up wit you
I got the feeling for sexual healing
A mental healing; how you feeling
She caught the effect and said she feel the same
Could you massage my intellect and stop the pain
Desire's yearning, the fire's burning
You hot cause it's a lot you're learning
Now I'm ready to explore you inner world
It's take a long time 'cause I'm just beginning, girl...
Take it easy, cut off the TV
Cut off the lights, use your mind to see me
Use your physical form if I'm hard to find
'Cause now I know what's on your mind

'Cause now I know what's on your mind

97,Tonight's Da Night,Whut? The Album,Redman,1992-01-01,201373,61,"

[Intro: Redman & Hurricane G]
Mic check, I can get smooth to any groove
Relax the tongue, let my mic take a cruise
Around the planet, pack 'em in like Janet
Jackson, she's askin' if I can slam it, I'm—
Yo, yo, Redman, man, what the fuck, man?
Get the fuck off that punk smooth shit, man
Get with that rough shit, man, you know how we do

[Verse 1: Redman]
Mic check, I walk around the streets with a black TEC-9
By the waistline, kickin' the hype shit
I never claim to be the best type of rapper
But have to show them motherfuckers what I'm after
I'm after the gold, then after that, the platinum
Beef after that, Hurricane G packs the gat, son
Trigger, bang, bang, yo, bust the slang, what my name?
It's the Redman on the funk train
Psych, you're motherfuckin' right, tonight's the night
To do what I wanna do, to do it like dynamite
The work perfected, when the funk been injected
I roughen up the rough draft to like make your head split
Punk, pass the forty and the blunt and don't front
On the block, 'cause when you do front, brothers are gettin' stomped
I'm not an addict, more like Puff the Magic
Then pass it when I'm through 'cause my crew (Gots to have it)
I don't claim to be a big rap star
'Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar
So listen up and take heed to what I'm sayin'
'Cause tonight's the night and me and my niggas ain't playin'

[Interlude]
Fat black bitch, nasty
Bush bear, booga breath bitch
Nasty, talk to your tits bitch
With them nasty Africans, Mr. Bojangles
Turned up shoes havin' ass
Lemming leprechaun haircut motherfucker

[Verse 2: Redman]
You wanna see me get cool, please, save it for the breeze
'Cause the lyrics and tracks make me funky like cottage cheese
Fuck the smooth shit, I get down with the boom bip
Like Q-Tip, I kick more styles than Bruce shoes kick
But tonight's the night what I write tonight
This type of funk with the flavor like Mike 'n' Ike's
Hanging out with my niggas, my niggas
The Pack Pistol Posse keep they fingers on the triggers
I keep the forty between my lap, coolin', rollin' down the highway
Blunt system pumps 'cause it's Friday
Roll over to pick my boys up, we raise a lot of noise
'Cause we can do that black, so ""Get the Bozack"", Jack
Remember, I do the type of evil that men do
Like cursin' out my window at a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch
And watch the ba-bump
Ba-bump, make your speakers pop
That's the funk, when it pumps it makes your rump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
But if you wanna see a fly but frantic
Cool romantic more slicker than my man Rick
You better check the Yellow Pages under smooth shit
'Cause Red ain't down for the bullshit
Niggas fucked up by lettin' me make an album (How come, rude boy?)
To get on the mic and let my fuckin' style run

[Interlude]
Nasty fuckin' green thumb Jolly Green niggas
Tango mango, pickin' havin' ass
Nasty epileptic disease crazy havin' ass
Johnny Cash, afro havin'
Jack of Spades, boots havin'
Tony Danza, shoes wearin' ass

[Verse 3: Redman]
B-b-b-black by popular demand, I expand
My hand to the mic and let my mouth kick the flim flam
I get sex, I get wreck, I puff mad blunts
I get vexed, I break necks, punch out gold fronts, chump, you—

[Outro]
Yo, fuck that, yo, turn this shit off, man (Turn that shit off)
Turn that shit down man
Turn this shit off, G
Boom the new record on, know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
So you want to be a gangster, all that shit
Smoke any motherfucker, don't even trip
You be hard as hell, take whatever you want
Punk suckers wanna front, they get done
'Cause you a gangster—nothin' more, nothin' less
Put my boy to the test and catch one in your chest
Since he was young, homeboy won't back down
'Cause real gangsters always hold that frown
Until you lose control, then you sell your soul
To the devil, motherfucker, 'cause you're way too cold
And all the people hide and just run inside
'Cause you keep usin' yo' gat, committin' homicide
Boy, I tell ya, life is way too short
Another brother just got smoked
And you killed him—ain't that a bitch?
'Cause it really ain't shit

[Hook]
(Gangsta, gangsta)
Shoot 'em up! (gangsters)
That ain't cool (gangsters)
Ain't that a bitch? (gangsters)
Shoot 'em up (gangsters)
That ain't cool (gangsters)

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you somethin', youngster, you got it all wrong
Gangsters don't live that long
I had gangster partners get they heads tore off
For some of that gangster shit, caught in the cross
You want stripes, take yo' ass to the service
'Cause when it's on, ain't no time to get nervous
Pull the trigger—yeah, you did it
You's a gangster and I got to admit it
But you's a youngbuck, you ain't learned yet
Killin' don't make you a vet
Get out the fast line, stick with the homeboys
Ready-made gangster get gone, boy
'Cause where I'm from it's the same ol' shit
You call them shots when you're down with the click
Niggas dyin' everyday, but that's a black thang
You either sell dope or you gangbang
But you got the biggest heart in the click, man
You did a murder, and now you're a hitman
All your homies tryin' to tell you, that ain't cool
Playin' shoot 'em up like a fuckin fool
But you's a gangster, one they can't destroy
Don't even give a fuck about your boys
You go for self, you wanna be on top?
Fucked around and now your brother's shot

[Hook]

Shoot 'em up! (gangsters)

[Verse 1: Guru]
I said people people, come on and check it out now
You see the mic in my hand now watch me wreck it now
What is a party if the crew ain't there?
(What's your name, kid?)
Call me Guru that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back
Slander the name and withhold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many, they go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year suckers are going nowhere
'Cause my street style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
MCs that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aiming on, raining on those bitch ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggas better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm 'bout to blow the fuck up 'cause I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfully mine
Yeah me and the crew think it's about that time
But on the DL you know that Gang Starr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My Nautica, asking for a hook-up
Well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business kid, this ain't no free for all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate, before I get irate
And I'll kick your can from here to Japan
With force you can't withstand 'cause I'm the motherfucking man

[Bridge: Guru]
Yo right now I got my man Lil Dap from the Group Home
Yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man

[Verse 2: Lil Dap]
So much anger, built inside
So don't stop to say hi, motherfucker just die
My shit holds a mouthful, so I guess you know what's up
Why punks get killed, at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip, Lil Dap remains sick
Yes the Group Home is thick so all you punks hear this
Every time you riff the more fame that we get
Motherfuckers act hard, thinkin' that they are God
Niggas just don't understand, let me be my own man
Did everything on my own, 'cause every place wasn't home
Anywhere that I rest, had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine, but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind, brothers doing mad time
Rhymes are organized like crime as they're ripped in a line
Brothers just don't know, how shit got to go
'Cause I was told, to never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto, dead souls I greet
See my man give him pound, then I walk with a frown
Another minute, another brother's gunned down
Shit is getting too close, that's why the Group Home is thick
So every time you riff, the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one across the street
Watch the one right next, because he's easy to flex
Took heed to what he said, yeah that deep ass nigga
While brothers hang around, tryin' to get down
Niggas just don't understand, I'm the motherfuckin' man

[Bridge: Guru]
And also on the set from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
We got my man Jeru the Damaja
Yo tell them why you're the man

I'll tap your, jaw, you probably heard it before
Step to the bedlamite, I'll prove my word is law
Drugstore worth more, dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef, a chief ambassador
Niggas get mad 'cause they, can't score
Like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot, don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
Like I said before I tap jaws, snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars, vic a style you said was yours
Money grip wanna flip but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizing my tools in '92
MC's step up in mobs to defeat us when
We rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson
Lots of friends, lots of fun, lots of beers
Got the skills, greeno so I always get cheers
Troop on like a trooper, no tears for fears
I'ma, get mines 'cause the crew will get theirs
Cut you up like Edward Scissorhands
You know the program I'm the motherfuckin' man

A dog couldn’t catch me, straight up

Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got them up open all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound

Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can’t get her outta my mind

""Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots""

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
God damn, another fuckin' payback with a twist
The motherfuckers shot but the punks missed
Ice Cube is outgunned, what is the outcome?
Will they do me like Malcolm?
'Cause I bust styles, new styles
Standin' strong, while others run a hundred miles
But I never run, never will
Deal with the devil with my motherfuckin' steel - Boom!
Media tried to do me
But I was a boy in the hood before the movie, yeah
Call me nigga, bigot, and a spook
But you the one that voted for Duke, motherfucker
White man is somethin' I tried to study
But I got my hands bloody, yeah
They said I could sing like a jaybird
But nigga, don't say the J-word
I thought they was buggin'
'Cause to us, Uncle Sam is Hitler without an oven
Burnin' our black skin
Buy my neighborhood, then push the crack in
Doin' us wrong from the first day
And don't understand why a nigga got an AK
Callin' me an African-American
Like everything is fair again, shit
Devil, you got to get the shit right
I'm black, blacker than a trillion midnights
""Don't Believe The Hype"" was said in '88 by the great Chuck D
Now they're tryin' to fuck me!

[Segue: Ice Cube]
""With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline"" (Huh!)

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
It's a great day for genocide (What's that?)
That's the day all the niggas died
They killed JFK in '63
So what the fuck you think they'll do to me?
But I'm the OG and I bust back (Boom, boom!)
Bust back (Boom, boom!), peel a cap (Boom, boom!)
Gimme room in the fire of the sun
Here the Mack come, here the Black come, watch Jack run!
Motherfuckers can't gank me
Fuck a devil, fuck a rebel, and a Yankee
Overrun and punk the Presidency
If it means that I'm down with O.P.P., yeah!
I met Farrakhan and had dinner
Now you ask if I'm a Five Percenter? Well
No, but I go where the brothers go
Down with Compton Mosque, Number 54
Made a little dough, still got a sister on my elbow
Did Ice Cube sell out? You say, ""Hell no!""
A black woman is my manager, not in the kitchen
So could you please stop bitchin'?

[Chorus: Ice Cube & Brother J]
""Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots""
Yeah, yeah
""But when will they shoot?""
""Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots""
Yeah, yeah
""But when will they shoot?""
(*Gunshots*)

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
You missed, and didn't hit Da Lench Mob, either
Guerrillas in tha Mist without jungle fever
But I got the fever for the flavor of a cracker, not a Pringle
Bust the single, here's my new jingle:
""Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots""
The KKK has got three-piece suits
Usin' niggas like turkey shoots
My motto is, ""Treat 'em like a prostitute!""
Now if I say no violence, devil, you won't respect mine
Fuck the dumb shit and get my TEC-9 (Yeah!)
And if they approach us
I, I - I bury those cockroaches
And if you can't deal with my Kill at Will
Here's a new gift to get, try my Death Certificate
AmeriKKKa's Most, America's burnt, it's like toast
Like Jordan, I'm goin' coast to coast
Dribblin' the funk, here comes the nigga with the motherfuckin' monster dunk
Get off me, punk!

""Watch Jordan!
Ayo, Cube, watch Jordan...""

Yeah, yeah

Daryl Gates got the studio surrounded
'Cause he don't like the niggas that I'm down with
Motherfucker wanna do us
'Cause I like Nat, Huey, Malcolm, and Louis
Most got done by a black man's bullet
Give a trigger to a nigga and watch him pull it
Negro assassin
I'ma dig a ditch, bitch, and throw yo' ass in
When they shoot, no, it won't be a cracker
They use somebody much blacker
What I do? I called up the Geto Boy crew
'Cause my mind's playin' tricks on me, too (Yeah)
Never died, surround my crib
And FOI makin' sure nobody creep when I sleep
Keep a nine millimeter in my Jeep (What?)
Peep when I roll, I gots to roll deep
Ain't goin out cheap
Met the MADD Circle on Cypress Hill 'cause it's so steep
They'll never get me, they'll never hit me
Motherfuck that shit, J-Dee
Now I'm relaxed
Grab the St. Ides brew so I can max
Sittin' by the window 'cause it's so fuckin' hot
And then I heard a shot (Boom!)

102,Jus Lyke Compton,Way 2 Fonky,DJ Quik,1992,251373,41,"

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Finally out the muthafuckin' CPT
Off to other cities and shit
No longer just an underground hit
Movin thangs, a local nigga made good
I made a name off of making tapes for niggas in the hood
And now, let me tell a little story
About the places that I been to and the shit that I been through
Like fightin' and shootouts and bangin and shit
All because a nigga made a hit, check it
1991, it was double or nothing, not a nigga wit' hit
Then we broke out with the fonky shit
About bitches and niggas and gettin' drunk and off that bud
I was doing the shit they hadn't heard of
But foolish was I to think that it wasn't no other cities like this
And they didn't like this
That Compton was the home of a foot in yo' ass
Where you got blast, and now that's just a thing of the past
Let me tell ya why firsthand
We did a show up in Oak-land and niggas was kickin up sand
To them bangin' ain't nothin' new, and slangin' ain't nothin' new
And for every nigga we done shot, they done shot two
Straight doin' locs since the sixties, before I was born
Families of young niggas mourn
So I'm just letting you know
That if ya plan to take a trip to the Bay
Keep your hand on your clip

Because Oakland (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah, I'm telling y'all Oakland (ha ha ha, is just like Compton, fool)

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Moving on to St. Louis, where they country as fuck
With gold teeth in they mouth but they still know what's up
Where it's hot as a muthafucka, hot enough to make ya cuss
That's why I kept my ass on the bus
But later on when it cooled off we came down and met a couple of friends
Who put us up on the St. Louis cap
The Smith Center, with Big Bob, Little Steve, Tojo, Biss and Rich
And a couple of bitches
Then they took us to a man named Gus in a store
He put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore
That's when I started thinking that this wasn't like home
But then they had to prove me wrong
'Cause later that night after we did the show
We went back to the afterset, and wouldn't ya know
Yeah, Bloods and Crips start scrappin' and shootin' -- in Missouri?
Damn, how could this happen?

Now St. Louis (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah y'all, St. Louis (ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton, nigga)

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
I don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good
They need to stop watchin' that Colors and Boyz n the Hood
Too busy claimin Sixties, tryin to be raw
And never ever seen the 'Shaw
But now, back to the story that I'm tellin'
We packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin'
When we arrived I saw red and blue sweatsuits
When I'm thinkin' 'bout horse dookie, and cowboy boots
I guess Texas ain't no different from the rest
And San Antonio, was just waitin' to put us to the test
And before it was over the shit got deep
A nigga got shot in the face, and was dead in the street
Then they came in the club thinkin' of scrappin'
Little did they know that we was packin'
Yeah, we was puttin' 'em down and scaring the rest, shit
I even had to wear the bulletproof vest

Now San Antonio (ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah, San Antonio (ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton, bitch)

[Verse 4: DJ Quik]
After about a month on the road
We came home and I can safely say
That L.A. is a much better place to stay
How could a bunch of niggas in a town like this
Have such a big influence on niggas so far away?
But still my story ain't over 'cause I got one more to tell
And the people of Colorado, they know it well
It was all in the news and if you don't remember
I had this show I did in Denver
With a punk ass promoter in a bunk ass skating rink
Bitches was lovin it, but niggas was shovin and shit
To the front of the stage to throw their gang signs
But I'm getting paid so I didn't pay it no mind
Then I poured out my brew onto their face and chest
Then they start throwin' soda, and fuckin' up my Guess
When it was over two niggas needed stitches
Got cracked in they jaw for being punk ass bitches

Now Denver (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah, y'all Denver (ha ha ha, they wanna be like Compton, bitch)
And you know that Oakland (ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah, y'all, St. Louis (ha ha ha ha, we made it just like Compton, fool)
Uh-huh, San Antonio (ha ha ha ha ha, is just like Compton)
Yeah, and Denver (ha ha ha, they wanna be like Compton, punk ass niggas)
I thought ya knew (ha ha ha, yeah)

[Verse 1: Speech]
See I was restin' at the park mindin' my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin'
Investigation maybe she was demonstratin'
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was goin' great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started buggin' out
Drinkin' the 40 oz, goin' the nigga route
Disrespectin' my black queen
Holdin' their crotches and bein' obscene
At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear (boom!)
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearin' brothers dissin' it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezin' parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me, see

[Chorus]
I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

[Verse 2: Speech]
I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killin' Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Actin' like a nigga and get stomped by an African
You see

[Chorus]
I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

[Outro: Speech]
The moral of the story is
You better look very hard at who you're steppin' to
'Cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it
Africans need to be lovin' each other and unite

Well, I am the nigga in charge over here
Sack the quarterback to make a cheerleader cheer
I fix my funk like Thelonious Monk
Stayin' true to the game 'cause I ain't no punk
Never been a bitch so I don't act bitchy
Smooth on the vinyl like Lionel Richie
And for creeps that's asleep you better ring the alarm clock
Don't dig what I'm kicking? You can suck on a warm cock
Originate trends, my rhymes they get paid
So I'm making ends and beginnings, see, I'm never afraid
Of a pancake MC 'cause I flips when I sways it
Housin' motherfuckers like a real estate agent
Douse you with my lyrical liquid for this hip-hop era
So I suggest you fetch an umbrella for my reign of terror
'Cause you can get your posse and your army brigade
Because I am not afraid
Oh, 'cause I'm the type of nigga that you never forget

Arms like sticks, hands like bricks, niggas be droppin' like logs

I used to be the nigga that'd keep you happy
Go ask your moms 'cause I might the nigga you callin' pappy

Captain of a ship pretender no never no sergeant
See I'm the type of nigga to catch a bullet in my teeth
Then call you Saint Nick dick 'cause you'll get hung like a wreath
Snap chin check is what I do to put your head out
Trip bangin', known to sneak and takin' raps before they get out
I'm the type of nigga that'll serve you on a platter
Like the piece of glass, when I drop it you shatter
I'm the type of nigga that'll kick yo' ass

I'm the type of nigga that's built to last

Yep the type the nigga that'll say what's up
To a brother but a devil would just get fucked up
And it's like that, alright, black?

You better watch your hide
'Cause this sound ain't big enough for the two of us
It's a must that I bust actually
See, I'm the type of nigga that likes to breathe
And I'm the type of nigga that'll roll my sleeves
Ah, but if there’s a tussle I’m down to kick some butthole
Nigga crash nigga bash with very little muscle
Hustler in my heart so I'ma play the part
Of that type a nigga with the ice cold heart
Chilly Willy, don't be silly
I'll take ya Philly and I'll bone her
Make her disown ya
Change her name to Mona
Put her on my throne, oh yeah
See, I'm the type of the nigga so you better beware
The nigga is on I'm putting it on like Al Capone I'm all that
The only difference between me and Alsy Palsy is I'm black, jack
King me

Well, I shuts 'em down like P.E

I own a size 10 in Nike and I kick you in your pee-pee, that's me
I am the one that kicked your daddy in your nuts
That's why your mental state was fucked before you hit your mama's guts
'Cause I'm the nigga and the boss
I flip it and I toss
This time there was a quarter only a dollar was what they cost
'Cause niggas on my Snoopy like the bird Woodstock
Getcha hands off my dick because I hold this cock
It's like I'm waitin' in the distance
Resisted from persistence
I'm Dirty Harry and I take your mama just for instance
'Cause I'm the type of nigga to make the fat lady sing
Hour after my flow, she wasn't shocked with my swing
But a little too much weight to be a new jack man
Got more rhythm in my toe than a whole blues band
'Cause when I rock the people roll when I recite from my scroll
Play the beat nigga forever mind body and soul

Um um, well, excuse me

Yea right, that's what the company kicks
Forget the black crowds, you're wack now
In a zoot suit, frontin' black lookin' mad foul

Who's the nigga with the new black
Strolling to your suburb house and I douse
With gas, now who's cleaning up trash?
Eat 'em up, yum, and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor; here comes the Predator!

[Hook: Ice Cube, Das EFX & Sonny Landham]
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out... (Here comes the Predator!)
(There's something' out there waiting for us)

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Got my black rag showing, and I'm hoin'; Ira Reiner
Can kiss my grits like Flo, on ""Mel's Diner""
I'm meaner than a motherfucking hyena chasing antelope
Put my chrome to your dome, watch it bust like a cantaloupe
I can't stand a rope, so don't try to hang 'em
Talk about dogs; boy, I can slang 'em!
Rat-a-tat-tat on your noggin
'Cause Ice'll cream your ass like Häagen-Dazs
Chocolate, I get crazy when I catch wreck
Even be flipping the tongue like da-diggity-dung Das-EFX
So who is Ice Cube? I'm a rapper, actor, macker
Got a little problem with the redneck cracker, did the tallywacker
Jerry Heller is a devil shit-packer
Coming with a crazy pitch
And the Statue of Liberty ain't nothing but a lazy bitch!
Don't wanna give up the crack, to the black
But you'll call it racial, if we go and rape the hoe
But eat 'em up, yum, and you're floored
Motherfuck Billboard and the editor; I am the Predator!

[Hook: Das EFX & Sonny Landham]
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out...
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out, but I'll be back
Yo, I'm out... (Hahahaha!)

[Verse 1]
I'm like a sniper, rhymes'll strike ya when I'm rockin
Mad chicks be jockin' when the G Starr's talking
And that's because my word is bond
I get much fan mail and I always respond
So tell your hon to write me too
Make sure she puts attention Mr. Guru
Brothers know the flow is unique
I got 100 wild styles in my black valise
MC's wanna be me so they keep askin
For me to teach 'em methods both slow and fast
And others wanna act as if they're better
But they only got one style which ain't all that clever
I'm cooler than wind, harder than cold steel
I get the ladies with more than just sex appeal
A mystic psychic scanning all your thoughts
I'll touch your soul and make your brain feel caught
When my rapture traps ya and makes you mine
You'll submit to the gift and to the lyrical lines
So suckers realize that the size is too large
When I come through I'm pullin' whole crews cards
I be wreckin' correct and on the gangster tip
MC's who front: I'm gonna bust your shit

[Hook: Dj Premier]
Bust your shit
Ok, party people in the house...

[Verse 2]
I wonder do you love it enough
I'm steppin' rugged and tough, never to front or to bluff
I got the fresh cut baldy, the brothers call me
Guru the man yes with all the
J-A-Z-Z-Y type essence, street type lessons manifesting
The one who make the fly ladies feel pleasant
Never forgettin' that to myself I'm true
Do what you want to but watch yourself though ""duke""
I don't wanna hear all of that loud mouthing
Try to pull yours out when nothing comes out
Then you'll see why you can't compete with me
The notorious Guru of the Gang you see
Starr stands for power like I said before
I'm like the doctors cure slicker than Roger Moore
I slide up to a crab MC like this
Tap 'em in the head with my mic like this
I'll be revealing that you're weak to the world if you wish
And I insist that if you persist
Then you get creamed, cuz I'ma get real steamed
So don't you try to flex and try to look all mean
Heyo check it that's dead that's it
'Cause all you phony ass rappers I'ma bust your shit

[Hook: Dj Premier]
Bust your shit

[Verse 3]
Now when you see me on the set you know I may unleash
A lyric like a mad dog barking through the speaker
Step off unless you wanna get torn up
Your raps worn out burned out fucked up
You lucked up or maybe you lucked out
'Cause at the battle last time you snuck out
But now I'm rolling over you full blast
I'm here to let you know no longer will the bull last
MC's telling lies and poppin' all those myths
Keep on fakin' moves and I'ma...

109,Blow Your Mind,Whut? The Album,Redman,1992-01-01,234666,29,"

[Verse 1]
Ah, look out, it's the Funkadelic funk for chumps
Who don't be knowin' my name, I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide, make ya slip, make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit, I DJ like Quik
The top notch of the block, 'cause I carry a Glock
Holy hot rocks, I'm hot, so give up the props
My style is hummin', comin' at ya, duck or get backed up
Dispatcher, ""Red, get freaky to the rapture""
So come on light the buddha, check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly, Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew, to the check a-one, two
It's you, who? Redman with the kung fu
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the rough neck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables, I roast your whole record label, kids
Yo E (What's up, G?)
Bridge

[Chorus]
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)

[Verse 2]
I do the hustle like Russell, Rush the stage with Simmons
Deadly venom, makes me poison like Michael Bivins
Or a cobra, pop more pop than Coca-Cola
Next to Yoda, I'm a star at war, plus roller coaster
I got my mind made up, girl
Come on and get it if you with it, troop
Krush groovin' smooth as the lightning loops
The kind of loops I sample from a James Brown group
I give credit, 'cause I'm cautious about lawsuits
PsychoBetaP-Funk, got styles hard as tree trunks
For real, punk, you got a blunt, light it 'cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being, watch me freak it in Korean
저리 가 비켜라 몰라 가라
누구냐? 나다 나 나는 Redman
나보다 잘난~ 내~ 누구~ 나도~forget it
I rip shop in hip-hop, I get props, my lip rocks
The rap stuff's more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I haven't blown your mind (Rewind)

[Chorus]
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I—)

[Verse 3]
Let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
'Cause I cut your freakin' eyes out
Fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
It's the Funkadelic Redman
And I hit ya with the Funkadelic level, the P-Funk, the devil
The spectacular, Blacula, bust holes like Dracula
Load up a course more legend than Acura
I'm swift, I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
I cough up a lung 'cause I freak it with the tongue
'Cause I can wax on, wax off like Daniel-san
Do the yea yea, boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey
Thanks to E 'cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard, word to Herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama
Plus I kick the grammar, straight from New Jers
It's the renegade rap Redman, really who rip rhymes in rough mode
Yo, hold your breath while I explode

[Chorus]
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)

[Intro]
Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal

[Verse 1]
I never thought that you would crab me
Undermine me, and backstab me
But I can see clearly now the rain is gone
The pain is gone but what you did was still wrong
There was a few times I needed your support
But you tried to play me like an indoor sport
Like racquetball, tennis, pool, whatever
All I know is that you attempted to be clever
Nevertheless, cleverness can't impress
'Cause now you've been exposed like a person undressed
And I could see through you, 'cause I'm the Guru
And what you gonna do when I start to step to you?
'Cause when I pay you back, I'll be hurting you
And this ain't no threat so take it personal

[Interlude]
Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal

[Verse 2]
Rap is an art, you can't own no loops
It's how you hook 'em up and the rhyme style, troop
So don't even think you could say someone bit
Off of your weak beat, come on, you need to quit
I flip lines and rhymes that never sound like yours
There ought to be laws against you yapping your jaws
Originality overflows in me
And the truth is, that you wish you could live the
Life I live and kick the lyrics I kick
But bear in mind that you can't think this quick
So Premier drops beats for me to say verses to
And if I sound doper, then take it personal

[Interlude]
Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal
Take it personal

[Verse 3]
Don't be mad 'cause I don't come around the way
Like I used to, I don't have time these days
I'm keeping busy making power moves
And don't try to say I don't remember you
You shouldn't let your jealousy show like that
I stopped coming by 'cause of the way you act
Telling my business to kids I don't even know
You're like a daytime talk show, and that's low
So you can tell everyone, that I'm jerking you
And if you don't like it, kid, take it personal

[Outro]

Wicked, wicked, had to kick it

A ho, no that don't make me
See what I want slip slide to it swiftly
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks for him

Or a shotgun - bang! What's up with that thang?
I wanna know, How does it hang?
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy motha-
Well-a, I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile

[Intro: Raekwon & Method Man]
What that nigga want, God?
Word up, look out for the cops though (Wu-Tang five finger shit, fam)
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way
Word up, know what I'm sayin'?

(Cash rules everything around me) Take you on a natural joint
(C.R.E.A.M. get the money)
(Dollar dollar bill, y'all) Here we, here we go, check this shit, yo

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen
Who was a fiend, started smokin' woolies at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question, I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question, I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-pow! Move from the gate now

[Chorus: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
It's been twenty-two long, hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not—
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryna hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

[Chorus: Method Man & Inspectah Deck]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me (My niggas gots to do what they gotta do)
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all (To get through, know what I'm sayin'?)
Cash rules everything around me (Because you can't just get by no more)
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all (Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down)
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all

[Outro: Method Man]
Yeah, yeah
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me

Who you trying to get crazy with ése?
Don't you know I'm loco?

[DJ Muggs cuts and scratches]

[Verse 1: B-Real]
To the one on the flamboyant tip
I'll just toss that ham in the frying pan
Like spam, get done when I come and slam
Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wreck shit, hectic
Next get the chair got me going like General Electric
""Aaaant"", the lights are blinking, I'm thinking
It's all over when I go out drinking
Ohh, making my mind slow
That's why I don't fuck with the big 4-O
Bro, I got to maintain
'Cause a nigga like me is going insane

[Hook: B-Real & Sen Dog]
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

[Verse 2: Sen Dog]
Do my shit undercover, now it's time for the blubber
Blabber, to watch that belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet, don't try it
I'll jack yo' ass like a looter in a riot
My shit's fat, like a sumo, slamming dat ass
Leavin your face in the grass
'Cause you know, I don't take a duro, lightly
Punks just jealous 'cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style, wicked, wild
Happy face nigga never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe, I'll explain
A nigga like me is going insane

[Hook: B-Real &  Sen Dog]
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane

[DJ Muggs cuts and scratches]

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Like Louie Armstrong, played the trumpet
I'll hit that bong and break you off something
Soon I got to get my props
Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad'
Yes I'm the pirate, pilot
Of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make you eyes strain
A nigga like me is going insane

[Hook: B-Real & Sen Dog]
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!

One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath
(Oh, man) Aye, baby, aye, baby, (shit) aye, baby
Get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin'
Aye, nigga, get somethin' to eat, dog
Aye, nigga, study long, study wrong, nigga

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breach through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Lil David Ruffin, Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice,laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back

And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, beyotch

Nothin' but the Westside (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on artillery (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
You don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
My troupe can, ill—fool, (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

Crazy Toones hangin' out the window
Fool, I got them bomb-ass tapes

""Planet of the Apes""
I'm down with Eiht and Watts Up
Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want The Bomb (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Just like George Clinton

If you wanna jack me on a lick
'Cause I'm that fool from South Central
You'll think you stuck yourself (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
With a number two pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With ""Mo' Bounce to the Ounce"" in the dash
Mash up, Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Slow down for the dip
On 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive, to keep the fo' from crashin'

116,Hip Hop Hooray,19 Naughty III,Naughty By Nature,1993-02-23,267266,64,"

[Intro: Vinnie & Treach]
Give it up for Naughty By Nature!
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho

[Verse 1: Vinnie]
You drew a picture of my mornin'
But you couldn't make my day (Hey!)
I'm rockin' and you're yawnin'
But you never look my way (Hey!)
I'm lickin' down your darlin'
In every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way

[Verse 2: Treach]
This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your head and shoulder
Brother older, bold enough to fold ya, yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save yo' flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit

[Verse 3: Vinnie]
Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real, so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what you're thinkin', 'cause I'm vampin'

[Verse 4: Treach]
I live and die for Hip Hop, this is Hip Hop for today
I give props to hip-hop, so Hip Hop hooray

[Hook: Vinnie & Treach]
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

[Verse 5: Treach]
You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground
Bein' low down, I do the showdown with any little ho round
No! I wanna know who you believe in
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheatin'
You said: ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo, PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit, not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not 'cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like somethin' really big is missin'
Even though my name's graffiti-written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today; Hip Hop Hooray

[Hook: Vinnie & Treach]
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

[Verse 6: Treach]
Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hooray!
There's many hungry hip-hoppers
One reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what you heard 'cause I ain't bailin' no hay
Ain't choppin' no crops, but still growin' every day

[Verse 7: Vinnie]
Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns, beatdowns are found
Don't know me? Don't come around!

[Verse 8: Treach]
Tippy tippy (pause) tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat 'em up
Your styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout-out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitties purr, now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew; any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver's name is Mook
I hittin' woodies in a hoodie
Peace to Josette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood G
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S. and Quest
Nice & Smooth and Cypress Hill
I live and die for Hip Hop, this is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop, so Hip Hop Hooray

[Hook: Vinnie & Treach]
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

[Outro: Treach]
Smooth it out now!

[Chorus: Onyx]
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Well it’s another one, in the gutter one, ghetto running em
Troublesome, extra double dumb, I come to beat em
Defeat em and mistreat em, so what if that I’m cheating
Now everybody wanna sound grimey (yeah I know)
I’ma show ya how, come on, all in together now
Yeah oh yeah yeah that’s how it gotta be
So stop trying to be loud as me cause you can't do that
Think about it; playing Russian roulette with an automatic
I bet my ass against the line the last bullet’s first on line
Stab and step and repping and run, packing a weapon is wild
Peace to the brothers on Rikers Isle
Tough enough and trembling, blend in like a chameleon
Buck, bye tough guy, oh my god I’m so high
Cause they say I rhyme, they say I look like a gremlin
But what does it take to make a kid make a million children SLAM

[Chorus: Onyx]
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys

[Verse 2: Suavé]
I’m the nitty, nasty, gritty smashing, never slow gassing
Strictly swift blast of the raspy-rasp fashion
That I provide, I abide the U.S.G
Besides the ghetto vibe, make me flip like Jekyll and Hyde
Of course, I come across with the pure for sure unadulterated uncut raw
Disgusted, busted, you wanna touch it, too hot
You forgot, you’re not ready, your head could get ruptured
Hit between the eyes, I plan to vandalize
I supply the static, I run with the bad guys
The villains, crooks, highlighters and the fighters
See the big black picture if you look inside of my mind
It’s graphic, expressed it drastic
So kill the copycat act kid, it’s all mastered
Directed it, when y'all least expected it
And thought it was safe, Onyx hit you in the face so SLAM

[Chorus: Onyx]
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
I’m a b-boy, standing in my b-boy stance
Hurry up and give me the microphone before I bust in my pants
The mad author of anguish, my language polluted
Onyx is heavyweight and still undisputed
You took the words right out my mouth now walk a mile in my shoes
I paid so many dues, I feel used and abused and I’m so confused
Excuse me, for example I’m an inspiration of a whole generation
And unless you got ten sticky fingers it’s an imitation
A figment of your imagination
Bu-bu-bu-but wait it gets worse
I’m not watered down so I’m dying of thirst
Coming through with a scam, foolproof plan
B-boys make some noise, and just, just SLAM

[Chorus: Onyx]
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys

[Outro: Onyx]
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys
Slam!

118,Where I'm From,Reachin' (A New Refutation Of Time And Space),Digable Planets,1993-01-01,275342,58,"

[Introduction]
Peace, peace, peace y'all
Strange
Real strange, real strange
An overdose, a nickel bag of funk
Now move on, move on yeah
Hey man are you ready to go

[Verse 1: Butterfly]
Boogie jive and rap is life where I'm from
Where I'm from, Ahmed play with Izzy where I'm from
Where I'm from, it be like run your coat black
Jupiter, keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where I'm from, nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where I'm from
The kids be rocking Clarks where I'm from
You turn around your cap, you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds booming out a jeep
Where I'm from, cocoons hide the youth, swoon units hundred proof
You want some beef, they will cut you some where I'm from
The beats is infinite where I'm from
Voodoo, ashubani, gangsta lean where I'm from
I'm interplanetary, my insect movements vary
It's kinky if it's hair, G where I'm from
The fire hoses blow
It's purple when it snow
I do a hit and go, split
It's hip, what's hip
When hip is just the norm
'Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
The kinks, the dance, the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my Mama that it's Africa at work
On vibes, we freak, them universal beats
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist, exist, to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip can't house the nine zips
For rock we can't do nothing, for this we come equipped
Off disc, off tape, rap blasting til from eight
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know, how Planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool, get funky as a goal
It's calm, relax, we're only some new jacks
That acts from the funk but don't play the role
Where you from

[Verse 2: Doodlebug]
Weekend Dig Plans got T's where I'm from
Where I'm from, it's Clarence 13 where I'm from
Where I'm from, brothers took the beats and got fly
(Why?) That's most asked by 85, where I'm from
Faking the funk you get did
Projects, tenements, pyramids where I'm from
We living off the boom boom crack
It's that hip-hop rockers, jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces can't catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue 'cause ghetto's the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone, into the sunset
Left foot right foot 1-2 mic check
Brewing funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair, here's a bib, have a listen
Of hardhead intervene, damn I know you're fluent
Yeah, 'cause Doodle ain't having it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from

[Verse 3: Ladybug]
Venus acts a fool at the square right, yeah
Doctors engineer in a pair right, yeah
Hip-hop made a point last year right, yeah
But Planets is the joint this year right, yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grass-hop
Duck out from the fuzz, that sweat the hip-hop
Rising like we foam, get it from the dome
I'm from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit, without no thread
Feeling funky beats go straight to the head
Fall into a club, dig on what we love
It be past six before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
Doodle, Mecc, and Silk, the quad where it's at
We need to stack a sack, for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips, just like busting caps
Rip it till dawn, kick it till dawn
Hip-Hop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it
Rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it going on

[Outro]
Everywhere, every everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah
Everywhere, every everywhere, yeah

119,I Get Around,Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...,2Pac,1993-02-16,259000,67,"

[Intro: Shock G & 2Pac]
'Round and 'round (Aw yeah)
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (I get around)
'Round and 'round
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
(Step up, step-step up, step up)
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (stronger than ever)
'Round and 'round

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Back to get wrecked, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""Bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
When will ya learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

[Chorus: Shock G & 2Pac]
What you mean you don't know?
Round and round, around we go
I get around, the Underground just don't stop for hoes
Round and round
I get around, still down with the Underground
Round and round, around we go
I get around, yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
Round and round

[Verse 2: Shock G & Money B]
Now you can tell from my everyday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (Tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Tryna make a dollar out of 15 cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me; I get around

[Verse 3: Money B & Shock G]
What's up, love? How you doin'? (All right)
Well, I've been hangin', sangin' tryna do my thang, oh, you heard that I was bangin'
Your homegirl you went to school with? That's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't (Uhh)
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low, long as you know that I get around

[Chorus: Shock G & 2Pac]
'Round and 'round, around we go
2Pacalypse Now don't stop for hoes, I get around
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round, around we go
Why I ain't call you? Hahahah, please!
'Round and 'round

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships
It's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips ‘cause I'm watchin'
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone, why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Somethin' is on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well, if I couldn't have it (Silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?
It's a lot of real Gs doin' time
'Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?
I get around

[Outro: Shock G]
'Round and 'round, around we go

120,Bring Da Ruckus,Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) [Expanded Edition],Wu-Tang Clan,1993-11-09,251466,60,"

[Intro: Sample from Shaolin vs. Wu Tang]
“Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style.""
""If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous. Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?”
“En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style.”

[Chorus: RZA]
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Ghostface catch the blast of a hype verse
My Glock burst, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Your head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aww shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks, an'
However I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin' terror, quick damage your whole era
Hard rocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous, 'cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow sparks like Waco, Texas

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I watch my back like I'm locked down
Hardcore-hittin' sound
Watch me act bugged and tear down
Illiterate-type asshole, songs goin' gold
No doubt, and you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that, carryin' gats
But yo, my Clan rollin' like forty macks
Now you act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo, soooo represent!
I wait for one to act up, now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what?
And that's one in the chamber, Wu-Tang banger
36 styles of danger

[Chorus: RZA]
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
So bring it on!

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
I rip it, hardcore like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin'
Bust this, I'm kickin' like Seagal: Out for Justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder One, my style shocks your knot like a stun gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty-ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pulled like a trigga
So bad, stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dad, bring it on...

[Chorus: RZA]
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

[Verse 4: GZA]
Yo, I'm more rugged than slave man boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loose, and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass 'cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through your back *swish*
Givin' bystanders heart attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me, who is him?
I blow up his fuckin' prism, make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it, come on and bring the ruckus!
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' 'caine? I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian, it's the Wu-Tang crushin' roulette
Slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin' ruckus!

[Chorus: RZA]
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

[Outro]
“En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style.”
So, bring it on!
So, bring it on!
So, bring it on!
So, bring it on!
So, bring it on!
So, bring it on!
So, bring it on, nigga!

121,Ghetto Bird,Lethal Injection,Ice Cube,1993-12-07,230992,41,"

[Verse 1]
Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood like everybody from the hood? Is up to no good
You think all the girls around here are trickin'
Up there lookin' like Superchicken
At night I see your light through my bedroom window
But I ain't got shit but the pad and pencil
I can't wait till I hear you say
""I'm going down, mayday, mayday."" I'm gonna clown
Cause everytime that the pigs have got me
Y'all rub it in with the flying Nazi
Military force, but we don't want ya
Standin' on my roof with the rocket launcher
""So fly like an eagle.""
But don't follow us wherever we go
The shit that I'm saying, make sure it's heard
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird

[Hook]
""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird""
""Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird""

[Verse 2]
Now, my homey's here to lick on a trick for a Rolex
And let me try the fo' next
Now the fo' I was driving was hotter than july
Looked up and didn't see a ribbon in the sky
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom
""Calling all cars, I think we've got em.""
I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood
I think I drove through every single hood
South Central, Compton and Watts
Long Beach, bust a U, here come the cops
Wish I had a genie with about three wishes
Metal flake green on D's I look suspicious
You know that I'm running
Shit, I hear it humming
Fuck, I see it coming
Is it a bird? Yup
Is it a plane? No
I hit me a right on El Segundo
Wanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala
Let's see if they would folla
Me, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another
Met me a baby pitbull and his mother
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window
I wish it was my kinfolk
Had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third
'Cause I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird

[Bridge]
""Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back
On. Errr, he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115
Miles an hour, with the police chasing him. Ehm, they're not gonna be
Real happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh
Ehrr, they hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse.""

[Verse 3]
Officer Bird's on his way, and I don't wanna see him
Could you please give me the keys to the B.M.?
See, I didn't want to gank you
But don't make me bank you, thank you
Tried to get to the hood, and you might guess
That a fool like me done shot Cyrus
Incognito, Ghetto Eagle
Saying, ""Fuck, where did he go?""
I bust me a left on Ruthelen. Park
The 735 and I'm bailin
Went to my homegirl's house and got a hug man
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman
Looked out the window by the black bed
I saw the pigs and the fo' on a flatbed
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face
I closed the blinds cause I didn't wanna catch a case
All that night, I heard the bird circle
While I was eating fish and watching Urkel
She said I could sleep on the couch
By two A.M. I was digging her out
Fuck the ghetto bird

[Pre-Outro]
""Which way is he going now?""
""Ok, now..now he's..he's actually southbound..on a service street
And, uh...Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure
Out which service street he suddelny turned off on. Uh, the sherriffs
Are..are...well I know that...Sherriffs ground units got thrown off""

[Outro]
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird

[Intro: B-Real]
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Pick it, pack it, fire it up, come along
And take a hit from the bong
Put the blunt down just for a second
Don’t get me wrong it’s not a new method
Inhale, exhale
Just got a ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double barrel bong is gettin’ me stoned
Home skillet, there’s water inside don’t spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet, still it
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky funky smelly green shit
Sing my song, puff all night long
As I take hits from the bong

[Chorus]
Hits from the bong y’all
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Let’s smoke that bowl, hit the bong
And then take that finger off of that hole
Plug it, unplug it, don’t strain
I love you Mary Jane
She never complains, when I hit Mary
With that flame, I light up the cherry
She’s so good to me
When I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
Don’t get me stirred up the smoke, through the bub-bling
Water is makin’ it pure so I got ta’
Take my hit and hold it, just like
Chong, I get the bowl and I reload it
Get my four-footer and bring it on
As I take hits from the bong

[Chorus]
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?

This shit’ll straighten your dick out
Can I get a hit?

[Intro]
Chief Rocka, Chief Rocka
Chief Rocka, Chief Rocka

[Verse 1: Mr. Funkee]
Boom shaka laka, yo, here comes the Chief Rocka
Rock it down, so jump up off the tip you're not my nucca
For sharper type to battle make the people say ""Ooh ahh""
Think I won't curse, I'll break down and say puta
?Hey, madrigon, sesa me bichafi mi chocha?
Say what I want because, I'm that type of guy
Now fam-a-lam, I'll be damned, slam jams the weak
Could it be the skunk weed that makes us oh so funky?
Now hold it let me choose, couldn't be the booze
No it's the shoes (the shoes?) It's gotta be the shoes!
'Cause girlies, they clock, they stand around and jock
So I say boom shaka lak, grab the microphone then rock
To tell you the truth, when on the mic
I'll say anything that sounds good
Like ""Drum pan, a drum pan sound over some uuuuh""
The Cat in the Hat and the mouse ran up the stairs
""That doesn't make no sense!""
C'mon who cares?
See even without the gift there's yours so don't be tryin' to knock me
I say what I want to say, as long it sounds funky
Some MC's wanted to buy me, so they try to take stands
But they don't understand
I'm the motherfuckin man
I amaze and astound, rhythm up and down
Smack a group of them around
Let them know who wears the crown
Who's-the-tip-of-the-top, the-cream-of-the-crop, the-best-under-the-sun
I'm the Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Mr. Funkee

[Chorus]
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka​

[Verse 2: DoItAll]
Well umm, boom, shak-a-lak, I got the fragrance, the funk
Whew, and it's smellin' up the hip-hop
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
Mixed a, little of this, and now I gotta rap
I'm the, Chief Rocka so I guess I am in charge
I freak it with a twist so you'll boom it in your cars
I'm the, one with the flow and the grip like G.I. Joe
I snatch, I grab, and then I grab the dough
See, if I was an Indian I'd still be the chief
The only other difference—I'd smoke weed in a leaf
To the hip, the hop, to the hibby, to the hibbidy
Hip-hop, oh no, I don't wanna go pop
I got, too much soul, rhythm and blues
R&B, ya see, all that's cool
But, hip-hop and rap, yeah, that's where my heart's at
Even back when, I used to break on a box
Backspins for backspin, even while I'm rappin'
Before I had a record, I always kept 'em clappin'
Freestylin' on the block, now I Chief Rock
I always entertain, by diggin' in my crux
My brain, so if it's gonna rain let it rain
I spook you with the hit
Make you Jump like House of Pain
Boogaloo boogaloo, shake and jump
And remember, remember, Chief Rock I won't front

[Chorus]
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka

[Verse 3: DoItAll, Mr. Funkee]
[DIA] Ay Mr. Funkee
[MrF] Whassup?
[DIA] Can I get assistance?
[MrF] For what?
[DIA] For what? Yo Jazz, flex a cut
Well back is the backer, I'm chillin' with my nucca
And if ya got beef, then you can live with Jimmy Hoffa like
[Duo] what goes up, must come down
[DIA] But not me clown
I cut 'em, crack a speaker when I'm pumpin'
So jump in, and watch your ears start hummin'
Through the block, and don't forget to boom shak, shak-a-lak

[Verse 4: Mr. Funkee]
Well damn DoItAll can I rock?
I hear a beat I grab the mic, and then I start this workin'
The kids around the way used to think that I was buggin'
But they don't understand how I feel about the funk
I walk with the funk, I talk with the funk
I eat with the funk, I sleep with the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
So now what do they say, when I'm walkin' up the block?
Boom-shaka-laka there goes the Chief Rocka

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Listen up, everybody, the bottom line
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just living like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip
Drafting of the poets, I'm the #7 pick
Licks, licks, licks, boy, 'pon your backside
Licks, licks, licks, boy, 'pon your backside
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide
Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
We got mics, when do we go?
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
1 for the treble, 2 for the bass
You know the style, Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Steady eating booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case, I own more condoms than T.L.C
Now the formula is this: Me, Tip, and Ali
For those who can't count, it goes 1-2-3
The anti-batty boy, big up is who I be
Brothers find this hard to do but never me
Some brothers try to diss but Malik, you see 'em bitching
Me no care about them dibby MC, my shit is hitting
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada
Mr Energetic, who me sound pathetic?
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?
(I don't know, man, I don't know, man, I don't know, man)
(I don't know, I don't know)

[Hook x8: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Complementary are we, the three for poetry
I got a humdinger coming hook, line and sinker
The Timbo hoofs with the prints on the ground
Timbos on the toes, I like the way it's going down
Down like a lady of the evening
When it goes in Toots, just believe it's in
'Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place
Take off your cleats 'cause you can't run the race

[Hook x8: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my God! Yes, oh my God!

[Outro]
The title MC means Master of Ceremony
Some people who MC don't know what this term means

128,"Ain't No Fun (If the Homies Cant Have None) (feat. Nate Dogg, Warren G & Kurupt)",Doggystyle,Snoop Dogg,1993,246346,66,"

[Intro: Ricky Harris]
You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On WBALLZ
Right now, something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow-wow-wow
'Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass with a fat dick

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you, lady
But now, I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' Indo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony, bitch, you can't do me
Do we look like BBD? You hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in Tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed to pay this hoe just to lay this hoe?
I know the pussy's mines, so I'mma fuck a couple mo' times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothin' else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt, ho, you'll never be my only one, trick-ass bitch!

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house?
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now, as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop?
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
'Cause you know I don't love 'em

[Verse 4: Warren G]
Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64—red, to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'
Just get on your knees and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

[Intro]
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high

[Verse: B-Real]
Well it's the funk elastic, the blunt I twist it
The slamafied, Buddha-fied funk on your discus
Oh, what you missed this, you got to bear witness
Catch a ho and another ho, Merry Christmas
Yes I smoke shit, straight off the roach clip
I roach it for the blunted ones to approach it
Forward motion, make you sway like the ocean
The herb is more than just a powerful potion
What's the commotion, yo I'm not joking around
People learning about, what they're smoking
My oven's on high, when I roast the quail
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale
Exhale, now you felt the funk of the Thai
Wanna feel the effects...

I want to get high–so high!
I want to get high–so high!
I want to get high–so high!

Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the (gunshot), but I'm here to stay

[Verse 1]
Well it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day in the neighborhood
Can't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good
I'm with whatever comes my way, hip-hop hooray
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain old Dana today
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, TECs, jimmy hats, in case I need protection
So I Land Cruise, pump sounds, play out wanna be’s
A kid in a M3's getting jacked right in front of me
So I play the TEC close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't wanna get wet, so they steps 'cause mine's is slightly bigger
But better yet I'm a threat, so you better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk, 'cause I don't wanna talk
I stay true blue, I'm hoping it's you too
I got the fever for the flavor of a Woo Woo
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Time to chill, hit the hill uptown, let's peep the sights
Shoot some pool, act a fool, 'cause it's on tonight
I'm doing the knowledge, it's not easy, easy
Watching a cop cuff a kid for selling a clip to a DT
But it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next?
Stomach ache, head to Steak-N-Take for a bean pie
Get a Final Call from the brother in the bow tie
I'm where little kids dream and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter moms, no pops playing with her son
I passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven
Fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game
You know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You know I gotta give props, I can't stop, without y'all, I'll be nothin
No wreckin', no checks, and no rhymin', no cuttin'
No stages, front pages, no phones, no beepers
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah
I come with the real life perspective and rule
'Cause me and my peoples from around the way remain cool
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day, around the way, around the muthafuckin' way


[Ending Chorus:]
Just another day, living in the hood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today, I'm feelin lovely-yay
Just another day, in the neighborhood
Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the (gunshot), but I'm here to stay

Just another day around the way
Feelin good today
I hear the (gunshot), but I'm here to stay

I-i-i-i-i got struck by lightning and the thunder
Wilder than the shit from the tundra, no wonder
Help me up someone’s pullin’ me under
A scorcher, flame on the brain this is torture
Terrible, horrible sick shit I brought ya
Sacrifice the virgin, urbanized splurging
Split splice oper-fucking-ratin' like a surgeon
Write rhymes that got shot up bullet holes in the paper
Escape the madness, Onyx the baddest yep
Souls of a soldier in the streets of survival
If you’re blinded by the blackness, here’s the gun to guide you
Fumble up crews, crumble up under pressure, god
It’s hard, fuck you broken tooth bitin’

[Chorus: Onyx]
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey

[Verse 2: Suavé]
Come and just bust me feel the real shit
Drilled through your eardrum, hell yeah I’m fearsome
My equilibrium, is touched with the U.S.G., sickness
Contaminated with slickness
Filthy, nasty grungy facts of the wretched
I got it to flex it, crazy desperate to set shit
Yeah son, keep ‘em on the run
If it wasn’t you too, then you musta been the one
It’s not a big case to erase who bass in my face
You’ll just waste ya time and blood so ya better play ya space
Cause if not some shit gonna get real stupid
And you and your man can’t troop it

[Chorus: Onyx]
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey
Shiftee! Shiftee! Shiftee! Shiftee!

[Bridge: Fredro Starr, (Suavé)]

One day I’mma rule the fuckin’ world, just mark my word
I've got the filthiest shit, human ears ever heard!
And even if you wash my mouth out with soap
I’ll still be as disgusting and despicable!
Unpredictable, liable to flip my lid!
My moms dropped me on my head, when I was a kid!
Back then I lost all my marbles, today I lost my job
So unless it’s Armageddon somebody’s bound to get robbed
Watch out! This could be you I believe
With a gun in your face, it’s better to give than receive
I'm more than meets the eye, energize
Make your blood pressure rise. Mad Face ain't no disguise!

[Produced by A Tribe Called Quest]

[Chorus: Trugoy the Dove]
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on ""The Promo""
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back 'cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

[Chorus: Trugoy the Dove]
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

[Chorus: Trugoy the Dove]
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
SC, Maryland, New Orleans, Motown
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo

We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA

Seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night, thus spawned the title of this program
The word, maraud, means to loot

'Sup Enron
Ain't that Snoop Dogg over there?
That nigga with that blue coat on?
Yeah
Yeah, oh yeah, that's that nigga
Nigga roll up on the side of him, man
Roll your window down
Man, hand me my motherfucking Glock man, give me another clip
Cause I'm gonna smoke this fool
Yeah roll the windows down
Yeah, okay there you go
Aye man, you Snoop Dogg?
Snoop, Snoop Doggy Dogg?
Man he's Snoop Dogg
Man fuck that nigga (Gun Shots)

What set you got now?
Fuck you nigga
Yeah nigga, what's up?
Nigga
Yeah mothafucka
Yeah nigga, one less nigga
Yeah nigga, you's a dead motherfucker now

[Verse 1]
As I look up at the sky
My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they break in trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live? (Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son) my eyes are closed

[Hook]
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me
Murder
Murder was the case that they gave me

[Verse 2]
I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rag
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some mo', really doe (check it out)

[Bridge]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Verse 3]
No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

The Inspectah Deck!

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I smoke on the mic like ""Smokin' Joe"" Frazier
The hell-raiser, raisin' hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So uhh, tick-tock and keep tickin'
While I get ya flippin' off the shit that I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' ""Goodbye"" like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and hit ya with 16 shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh

[Verse 3: Method Man]
It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Meth
Movin' on your left, aah!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style'll live forever
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a ""suue""
Enough respect due to the one-six-ooh
I mean O, yo check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*

[Verse 4: U-God]
Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with the ""suuuuue""

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Watch your step, kid)

C'mon, baby baby, c'mon
(Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid)
Yo, you best protect ya neck

[Verse 5: Ol Dirty Bastard]
First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass

[Verse 6: Ghostface Killah]
For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes

[Verse 7: RZA]
Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearing Aeropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll, then attack the globe with the buckus style
The ruckus, ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums, we'll be
Comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare, G-Gka-Genius
Take us the fuck outta here

[Verse 8: GZA]
The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight

[Outro: RZA]
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck

[Verse 1: Butterfly]
We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Them they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids
Us floor rush when the DJ's booming classics
You, dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly? 'Cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
'Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin' junky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock

[Hook]
But I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat
I'm cool like dat

We be the chocolates taps on my raps
She innovates at the sweeter cat naps
He at the funk club with the vibrate
Them they be crazy down with the five Nat'
It can kick a plan then a crowd burst
Me I be digging it with a bump verse
Us we be freaking til dawn blinks an eye
He gives the strangest smile so I say hi (wassup)
Who understood, yeah understood the plans
Him heard a beat and put it to his hands
What I just flip let borders get loose
How to consume or they'll be just like juice
If it's the shit we'll lift it off the plastic
The babes'll go spastic, hip-hop gains a classic
Pimp playing shock it don't matter I'm fatter
Ask Butta how I zone (man, Cleopatra Jones)

[Hook]
And I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat
I'm chill like dat

Blink..blink..blink..blink..blink..blink..blink....
Think..think..think..think..think..think..think...

[Verse 3: Doodlebug]
We getcha free 'cause the clips be fat boss
Them, they're the jams and commence to going off
She sweats the beat and ask me 'cause she puffed it
Me, I got crew kids seven and a crescent
Us cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt
Him, that's my man with the asteroid belt
They catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle-big
He rocks a tee from the Crooklyn nine-pigs
The rebirth of slick like my gangsta stroll
The lyrics just like loot come in stacks and rolls
You used to find a Bug in a box with fade
Now he boogies up your stage plaits twist or braids

[Hook]
And I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat
I'm peace like dat

Att du är så tafatt och så virrig och svag

138,Funky Child,Here Come The Lords,Lords Of The Underground,1993-01-01,271066,45,"

[Intro: Mr. Funkee]
The year is 1971
Now comes the first of the children of LOTUG
Lords of the Underground, witness the birth of the funky child
Doitall, hit 'em!

[Verse 1: Doitall]
Born with the fuckers from the womb of Brenda
She now likes the Lords but she used to dig the Spinners
First with the style from the birth canal
And now I got the flav to make the crowd go wild
So dig it, wahh! Ooh, watch me dig it
I'm taking no shorts unless it's coming from a midget
I tax the peace more than chicken packs grease
I'm nearly knockin' boots, but if not, I'll knock teeth
Wahh! Ga ga, ooh, cries the baby
Smacked on the ass, now the Doitall's crazy
No rattles, or playpens, or crowds when I'm rappin'
And yes, I do reruns, as if this was What's Happening
Now January 14 has birthed the funk one
The B-Day for Dupree, and yes, I'm funky
I got you bobbin' to the funky style
K-Def, let 'em know here comes the funky child

[K-Def]
Yeah... (laughs) born in the underground of Newark
Now witness the birth of Mr. Funkee

[Verse 2: Mr. Funkee]
The fifth of the terror, it's the return of Funky Kreuger
A.K. Anger, we told 'em Mr. Funkee Wallbanger
Conceived in the fire by a war through disasters
The funky child was taught to the ways of the masters
Mr. Funkee, yes, girl, the black mack is back
Here to kick my funky style, funky this and funky that
You can work day and night, you could practice all your life
But I still take the show and then I go home with the wife
Oh my God, funky with the style, Lord have mercy
I hurdle over rappers just like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Watch me flip the script, let me show you what the funk do
Make you call me uncle (What?) Uncle (What?!) Uncle (Who?!)
When I was young I used to sing with my sister
(Heyy)
Now I kick the ill styles, you have to call me mister
Cooling in the House of Hits, time to buckwild
Raised in the ways of the funky child

[Verse 4: Doitall]
Back up baby, here comes the stroller
We're hit when we dry crawl and hit rock 'n' rolla
I'm caught in the swinging hypnotized by the Pendulum
Distributed by Elektra, so this is how I'm killing them
K is on the M.P., Jazz is on the Technic
Marley's on the mix, and now the Lords have a hit like POW!
Now it's time to get buckwild
And watch my funky brothers freak the underground
In a second, or minute, in no times flat...
...
Bring it back!
And go grab the album to bring the Lords money
Take it home to mom to say, ""Ain't they funky?""

[Verse 5: Mr. Funkee]
We gone psycho and everbody thought we was DAS
It didn’t affect me, I said, ""So what?"" I kept on writing rhymes
I keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow
I fear no man, cause if it's on fool, then it's on
(And it's on!)
Don't worry not for other crews selling out
As long as Lords of the Underground stay underground
The brothers of LOTUG will keep the lyrical fitness
Don't worry about me selling out, mind your business
You might say, ""Damn, Mr. Funkee's going out!""
But if you listen to the words then you'll know what I'm about
Any props you receive are the props that you earn
I'm off 'til the funky child returns

When I take the Nina Ross, ya know I gots to have it
I lay back in the cut, retain myself
Think about the shit, and I'm thinkin' wealth
How can I makes my grip
And how should I make that nigga straight slip
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip
As I dip around the corner, now I'm on another
Mission, wishin', upon a star
Snoop Doggy Dogg with the caviar
In the back of the limo, no demo, this is the real
Breakin' niggas down like Evander Holyfield, chill
'Til the next episode
I make money, and I really don't love hoes
Tell you the truth, I swoop in the Coupe
I used to sell loot, I used to shoot hoops
But now I make hits every single day
With that nigga, the diggy Dr. Dre
So lay back in the cut motherfucker 'fore you get shot
It's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop

You tried to see me on the TV, you'se a B.G

Gotta take a trip to the MIA
And serve your ass with a motherfuckin' AK
You can't see the D-O-double-G, 'cause that be me

Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday
With the P-O-U-N-D and my nigga Dr. Dre
Lay back in the cut like I told your ass
Gimme the microphone and let me hit you with a blast

And bitches who fuck him gimme the ass

'Cause Snoop is on the mic and I gets wicked, follow me
Listen to me, 'cause I do you like you wanna be done
Snoop Doggy Dogg on this three two one, umm
Dum, diddy-dum here I come
With the gat, and the guitar will strum, I'm
Not that lunatic nigga who you thought I was
When I caught you slippin', I'ma catch you then I'll peel your cap
Snap back, relax
Ya bet' not be slippin' with them D's on that '83 Cadillac
So we gon' smoke an ounce to this
G'z up, hoes down while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Verse 1: Butterfly]
Butterfly searching for a relax
Pulling from the jazz stacks 'cause it's Sunday
On the air is incense, sounds to the ceiling
Tried to get this feeling since Monday
Looking out the window watching all the people go
Bugging off a funny vibe 'cause now it seems they're equal
Wonder what would Trane say, wonder what my pop say
Bugging off the calmness in the Apple
Who me I'm cooling in New York
I'm chilling in New York
The hoods is on my block and the brother's at the court
The baseball hats is on and the projects is calm
Dreamtime's extended (and highly recommended)
But early birds like me's up checking out the scene
The early worms jog, forget about your job
Just come dig the essence while the decadence is hidden
When people act like people, the theory is in pigeon
If you know the norm it's like Hades transformed
On Sunday's early hours the city sprouts its flowers
So get with the rhythms while you getting with the Planets
Vibe off the jams but don't take em for granted, just chill

[Refrain]
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot

[Verse 2: Butterfly, Doodlebug, and Ladybug]
We venture through the streets in search of funky beats
Extensive is the travels and it's heavy on the sneaks
Yeah it's kicking out the speakers of the Sunday morning jeepers
My man do Planets do it lovely?
Am I my brother's keeper?
We foot it to the park where the swoon units walk
And sit with the Phoenicians digging on musicians
Hanging with the rebels sipping on a Snapple
Bugging with my crew just tripping in the Apple
You be thinking peace when you're vibing with your flock
But you be thinking damn everybody got a Glock
If you got some beef please express that in silence
Or else... violence
But right here is the life, it's the children of the concrete
Living off the fruits and the functions of the fat beats
Hip-hop's all around, the members is growing
Please dig on the sounds 'cause the good vibes they snowing, so chill

[Refrain]
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot

[Verse 3: Butterfly]
Wake up, praying that the game's on
Maybe it's the Runnin' Rebs, maybe it's the Knicks
Maybe it's a rerun of an old TV show
Like Hawaii 5-0 or karate flicks
Maybe if the phone rings Butterfly will take wings
Speaking on some cool things fronting like I cope
Born unto flat ground now I'm chilling shaky ground
Reaching for Pacific Heights Sunday is my rope, dig it
Sunday's to relax
Sunday's to relax
Some Sunday morning drama is calling up my Mama
The hotline is in I guess the silvers knew the deal
Vibing off the jams of the crews on Sugarhill
Lay around and think ain't nothing to do
Checking out some Fromm, some Sartre, Camus
Mingus' Ah Um, damn Roach can drum
The DP's are life, there they go, here they come
It's time to grab some loot, put on the Timber boots
Checking out some dollies like Tasha and Kamali
New York is a museum with its posters and graffiti
If you're in the city on Sunday
Come check me, get with me

[Outro]
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot
New York is red hot, New York is red hot

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Strikin' through the deuce with a 40 in my mouth
The nigga with the rep of atheismistic doubt
Rippin' the label off the 4-0, based on the fact
I got respect for my dead folks, props for my nigga locs
187's in the hood, I can't say shit
One-time thinkin' it was premeditated
I could eat a view from the deuce-fo' block
40 in my mind, makin' me think I'm gon' get shot
In deuce-fo' deep, the nigga with the sickness
A nigga with hella enemies, always cool and 86'd
Niggas from the hood ended up provin' they was a snitch
Fuck it, created the X-Raided, now I'm tryin' to get rich
Ain't that a bitch? That snitch, nothin', nothin'
Motherfuckers mad cause they can't make tapes
And I gotta get paid, so I can buy my 4-0
To live the atheist life that I was brainwashed to know
Niggas run up every day, wantin' to get some
I told them who runs the motherfucker flow and then some
Win some, lose some, like a nightmare
I got enough shit on my mind, I just can't care
I'm on the run, runnin' from who's-ever gun is aimin'
I'm all up in the middle of shit and ain't even claimin'
Tryin' to survive in the hood is hard enough
Cause them niggas already thinkin' I'm claimin' Creek Mobb
Trippin' on gettin' snuffed by the view, smoke in the Gardens
Stayin' out the creek, cause it's hot and hella hard to get
A dub up without gettin' caught, and them niggas know it
Drinkin' that 4-0 ounce, in case I'm shot, I wanna be drunk
And don't feel it, that nigga, that nigga that raised the shit
Raised a Crip, but really can't fade the shit no more
But out of respect, I just can't gangbang
I'm in it 24 deep, you got funk? Then nigga, slang

[X-Raided's ""Fuckin Wit a Psycho""]
(""Based on the fact I put it on the motherfuckin' four..."")
(""They know I'm crazy, but they just didn't get convicted..."")
(""Based on the fact I put it on the motherfuckin' four..."")

(""Just another day in the life of a psycho..."")
(""Based on the fact I put it on the motherfuckin' four..."")
(""Just another day in the life of a psycho..."")

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Drinkin' while I'm sittin' in my room with the lights off
Voices in my head, tellin' me, ""Nigga, that's fucked up!""
X is doin' time, so he can't get got, but now I'm
Livin' up in the deuce and I can still get shot
So I'mma slang 'em, slang 'em like a motherfuckin' half-ounce
Trippin' off the four ounce, the four to the fuckin' ounce
To the bounce, every gat, but I'mma still put some work in
Wearin' black in the deuce, a nigga lurkin', full of juice
Bought from the wretched, the X-Raided, settin' 'em flex
Waited, that nigga had to murder before he made it
Now he's doin' 30 to death row
He said he always wanted the devil to have his soul
Young nigga, I wish I coulda told him what was up
Fuckin' with the so-called devil will get you fucked
I woulda told him, that nigga, he killin' the bitches all the time
But never knew that nigga would murder and try to ditch a crime
I never knew, I heard of a nigga that snitched, but now the sign
Is every fool that deals with the devil is through
Me, I'm a psycho, me Mama might go ill when she find out
Her baby's makin' criminals, that nigga, that mic' man critical
That nigga that lynched, that critical criminal hinges on the loose
So whoever I knocked, you think I'm down, I got the juice
Now all I need is a motherfuccin' Glock, D
Up in the block and in the Creek, livin' 24 deep

[X-Raided's ""Fuckin Wit a Psycho""]

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Droppin' it like this, sittin' in the crib, 12 o'clock
Half-lit, lookin' for a Glock, so I stop
By the phone it's ringin' and I wanted a gat
It's X-Raided, he made it to the hood, nigga, where you at?
That nigga said, ""'Round the corner at the pay phone""
""I got the dank, I got the crew and the nine, loc, you know it's on""
Let it be known, I'm a motherfuckin' psycho from the deuce
And all my other niggas got the same juice
But when it comes to trustin' niggas, I can't fade it
Frontin' niggas like a game, so I played it
Half-dead fools got me gang-related
A new nigga wanna kill me every day, shit
For every nigga that pull a Glock on me
I'm not dyin', nigga, that's not gon' be
I keep tryin' to get myself up out this shit
But all the niggas I know still gon' be claimin' me Crip
I'm not trippin', whenever they want the flow, they go
My niggas all know the antidote'll be smokin' a nigga's dome
So until I die, that's how it's gon' be, in the blocc
24th Street, nigga, livin' 24 deep

[Verse 1]
Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, ""Who you callin' a bitch?"" Yeah !

[Verse 2]
I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affectin' me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don’t want to see my kids see me gettin' beat down by daddy smackin' mommy all around
You say I'm nothin' without ya but I'm nothing' with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not takin' it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gon' come to ya til you do right by me
Brother you wait and see (Who you callin' a bitch? Uh !)

Infinity to infinity (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

[Verse 3]
What's goin' on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head
And you call yourself a ""gangsta bitch""
Now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wildin', actin' like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe... hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you tryna jump in front of the bullet (Young lady) ?
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain't none of this worth gettin' your face sliced
Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?
(Barking with no bite!)
She got to wear that for life
(Who you callin' a bitch? Uh !)

You can fool the people on the east coast an the mid-west
But In LA you still can't pass the test

147,Keep Ya Head Up,Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...,2Pac,1993-02-16,262506,68,"

[Intro: 2Pac]
Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin

[Verse 1: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 2: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

[Chorus: Dave Hollister]
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 3: 2Pac & Dave Hollister]
And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But, huh, please, you got to keep your head up

[Intro]
Yeee-hey, yeah
Alright
Come on now
Yeah
Talk to me
Yeah

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yeah

[Verse 1: Salt]
I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
You gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Heeh

[Verse 2: Pepa]
My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

[Verse 3: Spinderella]
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Nah don' rush me good, and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac (shit)
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Ohh, uuuh
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
You know what I'm sayin', he's a mighty mighty good man
Y'all hear me, now check it out

[Verse 4: Salt]
My man gives real loving, that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that
I've got a good man

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
What a mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a mighty mighty good man
Tell me like that sugar
Now break it down
I break it down one time
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man

[Verse: Butterfly]
It was 8:49 on a beautiful 9th day of July
There was not a cloud to speak of, so the orange sun hung
Lonely in the sky
I lay prone in my cavi home
Thinking of fine nappy Jackie and his jazzcat's horn
Sliding in a tape of Bird on Verve, when suddenly rang my phone
""Hey, Butterfly,"" the voice said
""Slip on some duds, comb out your fro and slide on down to my pad
The vibe here is very pleasant, and I truly request your presence
A problem of great magnitude has arose
And as we speak it grows""
""Damn, what could it be?"" I thought
A juice I bought and rolled on down to her spot
Seeing bros I know, slapping fives I arrived and pressed G-5
And there was Nikki
Lookin' some kind of sad with tears fallin' from her eyes
She sat me down, and dug my frown and began to run it down
""You remember my boyfriend Sid, that fly kid who I love?
Well, our love was often a verb and spontaneity has brought a third
But due to our youth and economic state, we wish to terminate
About this we don't feel great, but baby, that's how it is
But the feds have dissed me
They ignored and dismissed me
The pro-lifers harass me outside the clinic
And call me a murderer, now that's hate
So needless to say, we're in a mental state of debate""
""Hey, beautiful bird"", I said, digging her somber mood
""The fascists are some heavy dudes
They don't really give a damn about life
They just don't want a woman to control her body
Or have the right to choose
But baby that ain't nothin'
They just want a male finger on the button
Because if you say war, they will send them to die by the score
Aborting mission should be your volition
But if Souter and Thomas have their way
You'll be standing in line unable to get Welfare while they'll be out
Hunting and fishing
It has always been around, it will always have a niche
But they'll make it a privilege, not a right
Accessible only to the rich
Hey, pro-lifers need to dig themselves
Because life doesn't stop after birth
And for a child born to the unprepared
It might even just get worse
The situation would surely change, if they were to find themselves in it
Supporters of the H-Bomb, and fire-bombing clinics
What type of shit is that? Orwellian, in fact
If Roe v. Wade was overturned, would not the desire remain intact
Leaving young girls to risk their healths
And doctors to botch, and watch as they kill themselves
Now, I hate to sound macabre
But hey, isn't it my job
To lay it on the masses and get them off their asses
To fight against these fascists
So, whatever you decide, make that move with pride
Sid will be there and so will I
An insect 'til I die

[Outro]
Rhythms and sounds
Spinning around
Confrontations
Across the nation
Your block
My block
Dreadlocks
What a shock
Land of the free
But not me, not me
Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me, not me
Hey, what's happening?
Insects causing fun?
93 million miles away from the Sun
New grooves, show improve
It's the moves (The moves)
Funky songs, but maybe not for long
So, check it out

151,Ditty,The Nine Yards,Paperboy,1993,245029,45,"

Yo, this is how I'm comin' for the nine deuce
Another phat, phat track, so Rhythm D, pour the orange juice
And let's relax while sippin' on 'gnac because it's like that
I'm cautious of hoes, so Paperboy wears prophylactic
I wear a jimmy for the skinny that's in the long trench
Front row seats, so yo I know she's on the nine inch
Just to get a piece of the green, but she's an undertaker
Not knowin' the paper is a 'round the world heart-breaker
Many say I front, but yo, had to have a break down
Playin' you fools, so now you know why my belly's round
Takin' the rap back up and scoopin' up crowds just like a steel shovel
Not from the ghetto, but yo, take me to another level
Let the beat ride, but hold on to your woman, G
'Cause now that I'm rich so many women wanna do me
It make a man say 'damn'
I'm finally taxin' more than your homey Sam
But let me speak to the weak, I mean the rookies
My time is held up, extremely for cookies
Just let me clock this grip in ninety-two
And you don't bother me and I sure 'nuff won't bother you
And uh, you just watch a brother flowin' like Niagara
Think before you step, because these lyrics just might stag ya
Although I'm labeled with the black fade
It's gold D's on my four and gold 'lex, 'cause I got it made
I broke the veto once again because I had to
And just like Jody Watley, baby girl, I can have you
Just let me work this track, and yo, any way is OK
Your place or mine, all night until the next day, huh

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go from the top, second verse of the same song
With the conclusion, hoes should be happy for the ding-dong
And since a man clock a grip, G
It's like every nigga that I see be like, 'Do you remember me?'
A hustler, and it's known with more hoes than Lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego, so niggas leggo my Eggo
I have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove
And pick up the mic, and all of a sudden, I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo, believe I got my own thing
Straight Bahama hoes so miss me with a chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note, just to show up tokin'
So hide his eyes when I scoop him, 'cause we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there, huh

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go, uh, let's take a trip to another land
Clock a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the Lex-o, and roll out to my cabin
Believe me my brother, more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings
But I'm like 'What's up with ya? You ain't heard a damn thing'
Make sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection
Because to me, my life is more than my erection
And give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet
'Cause doin' the Ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat
Kick the kind of style that knock the funk off of Fritos
Make you man jealous while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault, I lay the pipe with concern-and
I ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'
And don't disagree and then jock, that's a pity
Just bob your head for Paperboy and the Ditty
Yeah

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
To do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
To do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;

[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
I be kickin', musician inflictin' composition
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Outro: Sample]

But still André got action, they Sweat like Keith, all on my teeth
I take it upon myself to handle mine, thinking that you gots
Ample time to do this, have you shot? I thought you knew this
I'm crumbling, no time for fumbling
Selling my sacks, watching my back
Wetting 'em up like splish, leaving 'em in a splash
Of blood, the clock is ticking niggas from my block is missing
I'm putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming pro but I be saying they procrastinating
Settling for less, bet' be ready
When they roll up in your nest and sink one in your chest and
You's gone, up outta here for good
Y'all be bobbin' back and forth to let me know you understood

So check me out, see
Once in a while when niggas be trying to test me, I gets frisky
Grab a pint of golden whiskey
Then they swing but, shit, they missed me, huh
I'm getting nice with them thangs, because I do like that
You heard me on the radio and, yes, my man, I'm true to dat
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear 'em
And shoot my dice against the bricks the way I wanna flicks 'em
Nigga, so ring around the roses, diamonds around my neck from flexing
But I'm running niggas over like a ninety-fo' Lexus, test it
Ten millimeters, count 'em, nigga, fuck a nine
See, I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes
And drive-bys, kiss yo' ass bye-bye, sayonara suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page
Ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be popping shots, like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets
Like them freaks be spreading cooties

It's simply marvelous, time is ticking
But some of that time when I be laying vocals in the Dungeon
Sugar Bear and Mone be smoking ounces like it ain't nothing
It ain't shit to take another hit, so hit it
Of the cannabis sativa weed reefer, yeah, smoke shit
It's all day e'ery day 'til they label me deceased
So fire up another one and smoke out and fuck the world, peace

We is gonna smoke out until we choke out

You should've been a cop, fuck hip-hop
With that freestyle, you're bound to get shot (Ugh)
Not from Houston but I Rap-A-Lot (Uh-huh)
Pack the gat a lot (Uh-huh), the flav's 'bout to drop, ugh

[Chorus: Craig Mack]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand-new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear (Ahh, here comes the Mack!)

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
Word up, no rap, no crap, you bore me (Remix)
Wanna grab my dick, too lazy, hold it for me (Ugh)
I'm straight, rap great, busting heads, straighten dreads
I'm everlasting (What?), like the toe on Pro-Keds
A Tec-9 when I rhyme; plus, I climb
Word is bond, your album couldn't fuck with one line
It's been three years since you last hear
But now, I reappear, your heart pumps fear
To your gut (What?), did your girl's butt (Ha)
I scraped it, shaped it, now, she won't strut (Haha)
I smash teeth, fuck your beef, no relief
I step on stage, girls scream like I'm Keith (*Haaaa*)
You won't be around next year (No, you won't)
My raps too severe, kicking mad flava in ya ear

[Chorus: Craig Mack]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear

[Verse 3: Rampage]
21, '94, mad motherfucking hardcore
It's my time to burn, now, explore
The flava in ya ear, it's The Boy Scout
I make outs, I make other rappers have doubts (That's right)
You're fucking with the wrong clan and the wrong man
That's it, now you got to get your dome split (Rock on)
I'm going into my knapsack with my gat
Take off my hat, guess I'm just cool like that
The dangerous, the ruggedness, from the Flatbush abyss (Ugh)
BLS, 97, KISS, bounce to this
I'm gonna live long in this rap game, niggas know my name
Yo, Puffy! (Burn 'em in the flames)

[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
You're jingling, baby (Go 'head, Daddy)
You're jingling, baby (Go 'head, Daddy)

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Hee-shee! Ugh, blow-ticious
Skeevy (Mmm), delicious
Gimme couscous, love me good
Mmm, damn! Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?
I guess like the jeans, ugh!
Flavor like praline, sick, daddy, yah'mean?
Papa love it, when he does it (That's right)
Niggas buzz it
But tell me, was it really just the flavor that be clogging your ears?
The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear (Ugh)
It's all for you, it's really all for you (Now what?)
Hunchback, close your eyes, try to munch that
Oil up your ankles, let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor, it reacts to your gold caps
Word to Mama, I tongue-kiss a piranha
Electrocute a barracuda, I'm here to bring the drama

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! Yo! Yo! Flavors in your ass crease, ha!
Busta Rhymes about to bring the noise, so cease, ha
Let me loose from the belly of the beast, ha
Everybody!
Hey, hey, hey! You better believe it's Busta Rhymes, the great
We 'bout to rip the Tri-State, yo, yo
Hey, hey, hey! I'll split your face and give you stitches
Throw niggas in ditches, slap the ass of fat bitches
Wait one sec, as I get down
I'm rolling with the heavyweight connect to the stomping ground
Now, don't you get suspicious, I grant your wishes every time (Ha)
Bring it vicious when I bust a rhyme (Word is bond)
I know one thing the whole world least expected
Is how we all connected (Ha) to break food on the same record
Five new flavors on beat, feel the fucking heat (Whoa)
I really think you should retreat while we blow up the street (Hey)
Instead of copping pleas, just freeze (Ha)
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
When I get down, I disappear, reappear
And blow up everywhere (Ha!), fucking with these flavors in ya ear

[Chorus: Craig Mack]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 1]

[Q-Tip]
One-two, one-two, keep it on
Listen to the shit because we keep it 'til dawn
Listen to the Abstract, got it going on
Listen to the ladies, come on and let me spawn
On your eggs, then you go up the river
Listen to the Abstract, that freaky nigga

[Ad Rock]
Now I'm Ad Rock and I shock and I tick and I tock
And I can't stop with the body rock

[Mike D]
See, I've got heart like John Starks
Hitting mad sparks
Pass me the mic and I'll be rockin' the whole park

[MCA]
Well, I'm the M to the C to the A and it's a must
The rhymes that we bust on the topic of lust

[Q-Tip]
And my Moms is not butt, but fuck it
Let me get down to the rhythm
Yes, I get funky and I'm shooting all my jism
Like John Holmes, the X-rated nigga
Listen to the shit cause I am the ill figure
Nobody's getting any bigger than this

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Get it together
Get-get it together
Get...
Phone is ringing, oh my God
Get it together, see what's happening

[Verse 2]

[Q-Tip]
Ad Rock's down with the Ione
Listen to the shit cause both of them is bony
Gotta do it like this, like Chachi and Joanie

[Ad Rock]
Cause she's the cheese and I'm the macaroni
So why all the fight and why all the fuss?
'Cause ha, I ain't got no dust
Yeah, you know I'm getting silly
Got a Grandma Hazel and a Grandma Tilly

[Mike D]
Well, I'm the Grand Royal prez and I'm also a member
Born on the cusp in the month of November
I do the Patty Duke, in case you don't remember
Well, I freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender

[MCA]
Well, I'm long gone, word is bond
Don't need a motherfuckin' fool to tell me right from wrong
I don't think I'm slick nor do I play like I'm hard
But I'ma drive the lane like I was Evan Bernard

[Ad Rock]
And I be working on my game

[Mike D]
Because life is taxing

[MCA]
Gotta get it together

[All 3]
And see what's happening

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Get it together
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Get)
Wait a minute, (Get it) wait a minute

Wait a minute, (Get) wait a minute (Get-get)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Get it together
Wait a minute, wait a minute
S-see what's happening

[Verse 3]

[Q-Tip]
I go One-Two like my name was Biz Mark
But I had to do the shit, just let me embark
On the lyric and the noun and the verb
Let me kick the shit off cause, yo, I'm not the herb

[Mike D]
Well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare
The Moog with the funk for your derriere
While we're on that topic, yes, I like to mention
When it comes to bonin' - woo! - I'm representing

[MCA]
Spacin', zonin', talkin' on the phone and
My brain is roamin' and I don't know where it's goin'
Talking lots of shit, a little tweaking on the weekend (what?)
I gotta to get him by the reins because I know that I'm freaking (yeah)

[Ad Rock]
Well, I'm a funky soul and I'm a Scorpio
And when I get my flow I'm Dr. On-the-Go
So, Q-Tip, what you on the mic for?

[Q-Tip]
Because I had to talk about the times when I rhyme
And when the MC's come in my face, I'm like mace
Because I back them off with the quills
'Cause I have to tell you, nigga, 'cause I'll keep you under prills
Resting on Nine-One-One Sixteenth Ave., off the Farmers Boulevard (yeah)

[Ad-Rock]
Well I'm from Manhattan, MCA's from Brooklyn
Yeah, MCA, your shit be cookin'

[MCA]
(Yeah)
Praying mantis on the court and I can't be beat
But, yo, Tip, what's up with the boots on your feet?

[Q-Tip]
Got the Timbos on the toes and this is how it goes
Oh, one-two, oh my god
One-two, oh my god

[Mike D]

I've got the kung fu grip behind my green trap kit
Never, ever, ever smoking crack

[Q-Tip]
Never, ever, ever fucking wack
I eat the fuckin' pineapple Now & Laters
Listen to me now, don't listen to me later
Fuck it, 'cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real
But, yo, technically I'm as hard as steel

[Outro]
Gonna get it together, watch it
Gonna get it together, Ma Bell
I'm like Ma Bell, I got the ill communication

""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""

[Verse 1]
No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under their noses
I hate those motherfuckin' posers
But I'm so real to them it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

[Hook]
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""

[Verse 2]
Oh yes, I'm greater than all MC's when I breeze
Give me room, please
I be like fascinatin' when I be updatin'
Cuttin' off wack kids, pullin' their trump cards
I thump hard, and make 'em say that I'm God
Niggas be pretendin' they're hardcore
Never know the meanin' of (raw)
But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
No double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, 'cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
'Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
'Cause suckers be like playin' themselves to have mass appeal

[Hook]
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""

[Verse 3]
I know I'm dope, but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks, but now I'm makin' greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks, I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore, I'm calm but wild
With my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you it's tragic, I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya
Those who kick dirt, in due time I'm gonna get ya
'Cause I be kickin' the real
While they be losin' the race tryin' to chase mass appeal

[Hook]
""Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal""

""Resurrection""

[Intro]
Yeah I'ma get this one off for 87th Street
South Side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere, check it
It's like come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town
I said come on, y'all, get live, get down
Common Sense is in your town

[Verse 1]
I stagger in the gatherin', possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin'
Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen
It's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense

[Scratched Hook]
""Resurrection""

[Verse 2]
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo) I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruise the Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
When it's my turn to go, I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm

Yo Mona Lisa, could I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking
Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Round up de posse, Fugee comin' around the way

[Wyclef] Yo, hey nappy head

A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all

[Verse 1: Wyclef]
You wanna battle? Swing
I bring commanding men like I was king
In all your dreams I write the horror flick of Stephen King
Cling to false also those papers say ock
I got tired of the fat lady so I sing to my own opera
Ba-lang-balang-balang-to-de-man-de-rock-cause I love thee
If you live by the sword you will be die by the gun
Cause all guys tell lies, and more girls commits sin
I was ordered to Code Red, but now I'm chillin' with A Few Good Men
Assassination on the kid from the capitol
I never play the soap opera but now I'm in General Hospital
Condition critical, spirit over who's the physical
So if I die, catch me at the funeral
I'll fly away, ohh glory
With a mic in my hand to a land where only God knows me
And the angels write raps on holy paper
I said I'm lookin for Jesus, he said ""Take the escalator
One flight up, is guaranteed He'll be there""
My sister'd be there, my mother'd be there
So...

I don't puff blunts so I always got my breath
Never had to battle with a bullet proof vest
They call me cock-weasel but I, still cave a chest
I don't wear Jheri curls cause I'm not from the West
No disrespect to the West, true indeed
I rock it to the East, the East is the seed
To see that them days back, yo sheepskins and Hot Tracks
Peace to Mr. Magic, things are getting tragic
Now we on some new stuff, I never feared the Ku Klux
My own clan is actin up, I blame it on the Phillie blunt
What you gonna do, kids are acting oooohhhh
Hill is gettin' badder, yo where's the corporate ladder?
Mr. Three Piece Suit
Check the square roots, Girbauds and Timberland boots
Nahhhh that's the serpents, and know them garment tips
I got a head full of problems and a hand full of nappy roots
I feel a Jones comin' down, yo I...

[Verse 3: Pras]
Hey yo a battle is a battle but a battle's not a battle
If it'sssssssssss snake doesn't rattle
Cause my style's as old as a reptile
As slick as a Nu Nile, as new as a new child
So come follow me to the land of Abraham
This land's your land, this land's my land
The blacker the black man, the better the next man

Ihhhh, feel injection
Put the needle to your skin feel reality's heroin
You maintain to put a negro in pain you used to diss me
""Oh you wanna hang with old Eddie Kane?""
Ain't nuttin wrong, snap your head to the song
Word is bond, you get wrong
I'll have you sing like Louis Armstrong
And I say to myself, what a wonderful world
But what the hell was so wonderful 'bout cotton in the farm
Mr. Slaaaaaave Maaaaan!
The harder they come, the harder they fall, so come one come all
Don't stall or I'mma stick you like a voodoo doll
Doors locked stop drawer for the count who drops
You slept on a kid from the boondocks
Out of Hootaville, land of the ill kill
Vailsburgh Viking so you know I'm top ranking Phil
Some say who coming like like the yuma but save the rumor
Cause I've been rockin ever since eighty-two
When I used to rock my Pumas...

A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all

Man let me hit that
You gon' pass that?
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs
Nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah

[Verse 1: André 3000]
It's beginning to look a lot like, what?
Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept
I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go

Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides

When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is

Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day

Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm full as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um

[Verse 4: André 3000]
It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one

Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar

160,It Ain't Hard to Tell,Illmatic,Nas,1994-04-19,202106,59,"

[Produced by Large Professor]

[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell

162,Sittin' In My Car,Behind Bars,Slick Rick,1994-01-01,226600,48,"

[Chorus]
Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said ""You got me waiting""
Sitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala

[Verse 1]
I got a girl, but I'm about to switch all that
Because my girl be trying to play me like the bitch all that
Shoot, clocked her daughter, for acting out of order
To impress a girl who to me knocked her out the water!
But because the kid swears love
Though when I see her friend it's like the shit wears off
I don't bother, while she want to kiss and then cuss and full of hate
Get her friend? Mission Impossible
Because she's the one the hon chose to boast to
The way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste
So make music in my basement
Don't cut her off until I find a good replacement
One day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's
House, cause the hon was sleeping over
My girl was acting fine, then the slime switched
Wanna diss, I said ""It's over, you waste of time bitch""
Tried to kiss her friend, twice then a third
She said ""Stop, Rick"", but didn't tell her friend a word
I went to bed, here come my girl touching me tenderly
Snuck out later, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before
Because she swore a nigga hit her
""Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?""
But I didn't (no you ain't), now the hon badgering
I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair

[Bridge]
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you ho

[Verse 2]
Another brother out for one thing, mistook him for
Steady relationship is what I'm really looking for
Sincerity, scoop the hon I done it
I said ""Being straight up, you I really wanted""
Though she fucked niggas with money like mad
Still found myself wanting the honey quite bad
Loyal to her friend, though she knew she wanted wood
Then we did it, boy that pussy was good
""But what if shorty finds out?"" Never be too clever
""Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together""
Chill, then we started to button the strap and
When my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened
Later on, my girlfriend stormed in
""We going to the supper club, some kid's performing
Bye, see you later""
Her girlfriend hot, let me see how they livin', Rick decide to follow
I'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can
Both sluts were sliding numbers to the next man
Contradicting of words being together
My girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather
Back in my Jeep, about 4:11
Popped another can, looked up to the heavens
I'm a good man, in fact I know that I am
And I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm

[Chorus]
Sitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala

[Bridge]
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you ho

Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said ""You got me waiting""

Cause I've got a mosse, when you wear haratchies
Then you hear me kicking as I own you, it's mad ruggie
The jump on my tip, but I thought nuffin' of it
Cause I let the microphone spark right after dark
And be dropping mad skillz like my name was Pad Mark
The rebel to society
Everyone's trying me
Looking at me strange leave dim raid it'll amaze me
Had I did something wrong go and my dumb
Brothers keep stressing, no shorties the one
To make it real snappy, and little nasty-nasty
Things get pawsie-pawsie

So you're hanging out with deuce, now you say that rock rues

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking ""Gimme some,"" living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Rollo, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb sh..., and I'm probably gon' do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though
(Why not?) Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you, I
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get yourself up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bull out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without?
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't, do you have any suggestions?
'Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You got to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Verse 2: Big Gipp]
A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my grits, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Sedan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
'Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these -itches might wind up dead, 'cause I have no time for jail
Buck Clampett cops, buck Elgin Bell
And crooked face Campbell, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo'
OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo!
My White Owls are burning kind of slow

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You got to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

165,Life's a Bitch (feat. AZ & Olu Dara),Illmatic,Nas,1994-04-19,210840,58,"

[Produced by L.E.S. & Nas]

[Intro: AZ and Nas]
Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!

[Verse 1: AZ]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‘Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

[Verse 2: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

[Chorus: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die

[Intro: Method Man]
Basically
Can't fuck with me

[Verse 1: Method Man]
I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental, based on instrumental
Records, hey, so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the king
But niggas is decaf, I stick 'em for the cream
Check it, just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad, fish accept it
In your Cross Colour clothes, you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Krossed
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and comin' for the head piece, protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket
Niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me, bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pullin' niggas files, I'm sick
Insane, crazy, driving Miss Daisy
Out her fucking mind, now I got mine, I'm Swayze

[Chorus: Method Man]
Is it real, son, is it really real, son?
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real, yeah, uh

[Interlude: Booster & Method Man]
When I was a likle stereo (Stereo)
I listen to some Champion (Champion)
I always wondered (Wondered)
When I will be di number one (Tical)
And now yuh listen to di Gorgon (Gorgon)
And a Gorgon sound a Rein
An' any jump and come tes' mi (Test me)
Mi a-go lick out dem brain (it’s like that)

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Brothers wanna hang with the Meth, bring the rope
The only way you'll hang is by the neck
Nigga, bolt off the set, comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga, you can bet your bottom dollar, hey, I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse, word to God
It's the Wu comin' through, stickin' niggas for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw, Mr. Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test, realize you're no contest
Son, I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four-
Nine-three-eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it, 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh, vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me, ayy, give it to me raw
I've learned that when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a ho
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay the roll

[Interlude: Method Man]
What, basically that, Meth-Tical, '94 style (Northern spicy brown mustard hoes, word up, we be hazardous)
We have to stick you

[Chorus: Method Man]
Is it real, son, is it really real, son? (Motherfucker, I'll fuckin')
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real (Slide you down a rusty razor blade into a pool of alcohol)
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real

[Outro: Method Man]
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel at some staircase, piss
I'll fuckin' cut your eyelids off and feed you nothin' but sleepin' pills
Get yours, motherfucker
So fuck the ho, fuck the ho

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well, it's the M-I-crooked letter coming around the South
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bending corners in my 'Lac, boi
'Cause that's how we be rolling here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothing to see

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed
Who raise yo' block? The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, swiftly
They ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em
The devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know em
Show 'em who's the OK
Like collard greens and Hoecakes, I got soul
That's something that you ain't got
That's why your style is rot–ten
Stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell, swollen got my pockets, business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that

You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes

Like a Southern hustler supposed to do
I's in the house like... a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Taking 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
Look, my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Well, okey dokey, 'Kast out
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?
I take my time cruising 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge, P-U-M-P
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?
See, I ain't Finlay, getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me
'Cause sleep and you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

[Chorus: Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 5: Big Boi]
Well, Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all day and day, be rolling like that today, hoe
So back up off it, get up on it if you want it, ya'll
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

[Verse 6: Andre 3000]
Step up in my shoes, you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming, it's seeming
That I'm glistening, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side, full of pride
Now ain't that something?
I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't Braille, but I'm bumping
Thumping out the roaches, Dungeon if y'all missed it
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, OutKast, Southernplayalistic

[Chorus: Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

169,Code Of The Streets,Hard To Earn,Gang Starr,1994-03-08,209333,45,"

[Verse 1]
Take this for example young brothers want rep
Cause in the life they're living, you can't half step
It starts with the young ones doing crime for fun
And if you ain't down, you'll get played out son
So let's get a car, you know, a fly whip
Get a dent puller, screwdriver and be off quick
With a dope ride, yeah, and a rowdy crew
We can bag us a Benz and an Audi, too
Even a jeep or a van, goddamn, we're getting ours, yo
Take a trip up the strip, and be like stars so
It doesn't matter if the cops be scoping
They can't do jack, that's why a young brother's hopin'
To do anything, anywhere, anyplace
Buckwild in another court case
It's the code of the streets

[Verse 2]
They might say we're a menace to society
But at the same time I say ""Why is it me?""
Am I the target, for destruction?
What about the system, and total corruption?
I can't work at no fast-food joint
I got some talent, so don't you get my point?
I'll organize some brothers and get some crazy loot
Selling D-R-U-G-S and clocking dollars, troop
Cause the phat dough, yo, that suits me fine
I gotta have it so I can leave behind
The mad poverty, never having always needing
If a sucker steps up, then I leave him bleeding
I gotta get mine, I can't take no shorts
And while I'm selling, here's a flash report
Organized crime, they get theirs on the down low
Here's the ticket, wanna bet on a horse show?
You gotta be a pro, do what you know
When you're dealing with the code of the streets

[Verse 3]
Nine times out of ten I win, with the skills I be wielding
Got the tenth one kneeling, let me express my feelings
Guru has never been one to play a big shot
It's just the styles I got that keep my mic hot
And fuck turning my back to the street scene
It gives me energy, so I'mma keep fiends
Coming, just to get what I'm selling
Maybe criminal or felon dropping gems on your melon
So keep abreast to the Gang Starr conquest
Underground ruffnecks, pounds of respect
I've never been afraid to let loose my speech
My brothers know I kick the code of the streets

[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 1]
Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Aiyyo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 2]
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 3]
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

[Chorus]
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent

[Outro]
One time for your mothafuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
That's living the real fucking life in every projects, all over
To my man Big Will, he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S
Big Cee-Lo from the Don, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse
The Goodfellas, my man Cormega, Lakey the Kid
Can't forget Draws, the Hillbillies
My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogie
Crazy barrio spot, (Big Dove), we rock shit a lot, PHD
And my man Preemo from Gang Starr
'94 real shit y'all (word up Harry O)
Fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though!

[Nas' posse]
Bitch ass niggas! Bitch ass niggas!
You bitch ass motherfuckers!
Come to Queensbridge, motherfucker!
Yeah, yeah, let's bring it back
That's just a warm up
‘Cause I can– on anybody, anybody

[Verse]
Now the funeral is over, and all the tears are dried up
Niggas hanging tape on the cut getting fired up
Looking for the nigga who pulled his pistol on my homie
An eye for an eye, so now your life is what you owe me
Look deep into the eyes of your motherfucking killer
I want you to witness your motherfucking murder, nigga
And since you wants to kill then your ass has gots to fry
But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slipped I guess you sleep
You sho' nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
Cause where I come from yo, everybody's got a gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end
I'm rolling through your hood and now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house now your sister's life's in danger (by a total stranger)
With a gang of, niggas wanting to bang you
And hang you, stain you, with one up in the chamber
Let's take a trip up Holaway
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
We standing up for our own shit
And if you outside the clique then you die, bitch
It ain't no love in this motherfucker
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother, uh
Because we real with this shit so we stay true
And since we bang then we do what O.G. say do
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror so I'm looking at me vaguely
But I can't seem to fade me
I've got my pistol pawn cocked
Ready to lay shots nonstop until I see your monkey-ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit you motherfuckers know who run it
So when you put this motherfucker to the test
You gotta realize something nigga
You fucking with the very best
I got this killa up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother so I talk to my diary
I'm going off on the deep end
I found myself face-to-face with myself while I'm sleeping
I see your picture in my head and my hands shake
You can run, you can hide but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this mutherfucker fore he gets to me
So in your own blood, you'll bathe
And I won't stop until I put this motherfucker in his fucking grave
And I can say this once again
You can cry but you'll still die
They'll be no tears in the end

Suliman the Bronx Ripper on the live puff
V Love, that's my money like dominoes
Brooklyn do keep it rocking till the sun shows
I pop my junk my junk, I pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk, Pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk, like what you want you want
Pop my junk my junk, I pop my junk
The noise that we made is blue, in color sound
Toys who played my crew couldn't walk the new ground
Or chalk the new sound
A bop like Teddy Charles was burning
When I excurse on excursions
Arriving at the doors of mind shores of seas
Burnt you with degrees solarly
Plus my leather jacket go acid disappear in the wisp
In the mist, with a fist
Proletariat, Cad-i-lac steering it
Fro soul gold Panther crew grab our poppers
Now, I'm making bacon
Still saying wa ah salaam ah lakum
Fresh joints we make 'em like water
Butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
So I gave my mind a pound cause y'all we had it down
We symbolize the blessed and represent the rest
Grabs in my pockets I release my hot rockets
K.B. said ""What you give 'em?"" I was like ""Mad rhythm.""
That's my junk

Tote my fist right up right against the fascist
Descend to my borough fix my diction

Fossil watch fifth line still shining
I'm left this year I'm not a player
In my vein lives bell hooks Derrick Bell, Reggie Butler
See Marvin knew it, and Sly knew it
Cube know it and now we do it outta Brooklyn
Outta sight brown sandals handlin' M.C.s with angles
Commit to street corners where players be jayin

Word to mouth brought the clout 'specially in the summer
We vanish like vapor
Burn paper
We deal real-real so chill
We linger in the funk

Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nothing make a man feel better than a woman

There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothing, you made a brother feel like he was something
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no fronting
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say, ""Baby, it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me, baby
Never ever give my pussy away
And keep it tight, aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life, you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be living in the fucking lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to fuck with me
But you did, now I'm going all out, kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own

I chant 'eeny, meeny, miny, moe'
I wreck the mic like a pimp pimps hoes
Here's how it goes: I am a genius, I mean this
I shape this, you'll tape this, I'm kinda fiendish
You wish that you could come into my neighborhood
Meanin' my mental state, still I'm 5-foot-8
Crazy as I wanna be, ‘cause I make it orderly
You could say I'm sorta the boss, so get lost
The brother who will make you change opinions
Dominions, I'm in 'em when it's time to kick shit from the heart
Plus, I get a piece of the action
Feelin' satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid
Too late, when they dip in the kick, they get sprayed
Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is
I get more props and stunts than Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes
And can't lose when I cruise out on the expressway
Leavin' the bodega, I say ""Suavé""
Premier's got more beats than barns got hay
Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money, never have to run

[Verse 3: Smooth B]
Yo, Keithy E, I left my Phillie at home, do you have another?
I wanna get blunted, my brother
Now, may I make a mark then make a spark
Over this phat track – or should I say dope beat?
Subtract, delete
All of the wick wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's comin' from way, way back
Hey, yo, Premier, please pass that buddha sack
You heard we quit? No way, bullshit!
I told you before we come back with more hits
I provide bright flavor, so you can sketch me
Do me a favor, don't try to catch me
Slightly ahead of the game, I'm not a lame
Ask him, he'll tell you the same he knows my name
Smooth, I drop jewels like paraphernalia
I'm infallible, not into failure
Like a rhinoceros, my speed is prosperous
And pure knowledge expands from my esophagus
I write in the night to bring truth to the light
My dialogue is my own, ‘cause Smooth B will never bite

[Outro: scratched Smooth B]
After the tour quits, I come back with more hits
After the tour quits, I come back with more hits
After the tour quits, I come back with more hits

176,Pour Out A Little Liquor,Thug Life: Volume 1,Thug Life,1994-01-01,209466,45,"

[Intro]
Yeah, pour out a little liquor for your homies, nigga
This one here go out to my nigga Mike Cooley
(Light up a fat one for this one!)
How you come up, man?

[Verse 1]
I started young, kickin' dust and livin' rough
You'd watch your mouth, around my mama you couldn't cuss, man
I had a down-ass homie though, we ran the streets
And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh
I packed a nine and my nigga packed a forty-five
We drinkin' forties, lil' shorties livin' naughty lives
You couldn't stop us, long as I got my Glock, fuck the coppers
Hangin' on the block, slangin' rocks and makin' profits
I couldn't fuck with the school life
I was a fool, I'd play that motherfucker for a tool, man
Tonight'll be the night, that's what we thinkin'
Hustlin' in the rain, felt no pain 'cause we drinkin'
Playin' them hoes like manure
First let my nigga fuck and then I fuck, that's how we do her (haha)
It's two niggas comin' up out the hood
Livin' life just as good as we could
But since a bitch can't be trusted
Hoes snitched to the police, now my nigga's busted
The cops whoopin' on my nigga in jail
Tryin' to get a motherfucker to tell
And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
Pour out a little liquor!

[Chorus]
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
This goes out to all you so-called G's
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
Pour out a little liquor for your real motherfuckin' partners
Don't let the drink get like that, y'all, huh
Pour out a little liquor!
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
Pour out a little liquor!
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
What's that you drinkin' on?

[Verse 2]
Drinkin' on gin, smokin' on blunts and it's on
Reminisce about my niggas that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
'Cause I'm losin' all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin' with them suckers 'til my knuckles turn purple
Mama told me, ""Son, there'll be days like this.""
Don't wanna think so, I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein' big-time G's
Rollin' in mob cars, movin' them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get tore down for my niggas in the pen', yo
Your son's gettin' big and strong
And I'd love him like one of my own, so you come home
And the years sure fly with a quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin' yo' business
That's the way it's supposed to be, homie
If you was me, you'd do the shit for me, homie
I can remember scrappin' back to back, throwin' dogs
On them suckers, runnin' up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let you know how much a nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor!

Yeah, nigga man man, pour out a little liquor!

[Hook: Artifacts with Scratches by Roc Raida]
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down

[Verse 1: El Da Sensei]
C’mon and get down with that Artifacts sound
Where kids get wreck, and the beat’s bound to pound
We’re strolling through the industry, B, see, we gotta be
The next shit that kicks ‘cause brothers ain’t got it
In this rap shit, ain’t no time for the dilly-dally
Pally throw a match in the Gasoline Alley
Blew up mad spots, kids was jealous for the props, see
The shit never stops, hops, just looking for my dillz-knot
Styles relate, never fake, broke breaks in every crate
Old freestyles and dirty-ass copied-over tapes
Notify that the Artifacts never slack
While crews is on stage wack, we just play the back, now
The flip tripper ripper splits ya wit da mixture
All crews who never paid dues, watch it ‘fore I get ya
‘Cause nowadays, it’s the ways of the underground, but
They’re wack now, so c’mon wit da git down

[Hook: Artifacts with Scratches by Roc Raida]
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down

[Verse 2: Tame One]
You know the stats.  If not, then ask some niggas who
Heard of me, the half on the Artifacts in Jersey
‘Cause brothers be buggin’, not givin’ love to the nuccas, sayin’
Fuck us ‘cause we be shinin’ brighter than them suckers
Shootin’ me prison, nobody listens to your dissin’
‘Cause, yo, my shit’s legit, and as a lyricist, I’m hittin’
The high notes, so why don’t I smile when I take pictures?
‘Cause now that I rock, I got more niggas on my jock than bitches
I just wanna do my jams with fams and slam into some hypeness
But biters and backstabbin’ rappers don’t even like us
But props due.  Peep The Source, Rap Pages and the Billboard
And read about the tours while you be flappin’ your jaws
I freak techniques ‘cause talk is cheaper than beepers from Broad Street
Punks pop junk, Tame and Da Sensei leave ‘em all beat
So peep how deep my technique freaks and how my shit sounds
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down

[Hook: Artifacts with Scratches by Roc Raida]
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down

[Verse 3: El da Sensei]
Hold up
You rap sucker, duck.  Buck, the track’s rough enough
To prove a point, that the niggas is the joint
Magazines where we’re seen, now pop the tape in your deck.  I got
The Heavy Ammunition ‘cause I’m Flexi Wit Da Tech
Niggas can’t believe the Artifacts achieve, got
Tricks up my sleeve, so bow down on your knees, yo
We ain’t got the same lame, ordinary, plain game
Put to shame any crew who wants to feel the flame
So bring submission to the rap recognition
My right hand is itching from the shit that I’m scripting
So pass the baton to the next runner up, Tame
I give a pound, so c’mon wit da git down

[Verse 4: Tame One]
Ayyo
Word to my grandma’s tampons, I drop bombs, but since our demo tracks
Had gaps, some said my fat raps was half-assed
Watchin’ others rock and clock, we shocked ‘em like a robot with
Our props, so now the Notty Head Niggas got more knots, yo
My pockets are lumpy, chump, my drunk style is trunky, dunk
My disc in crisp, put funk in funk like Humpty Hump
‘Cause I’m comin’ from the underground, I’m down wit da git down
MC’s who used to diss us, get pissed ‘cause they ain’t shit now
The Artifacts, represent on every stage we step on
The days of gettin’ slept on are dead because we keep on
Peepin’ these weak MC’s who cheese with their bologna ‘cause
They’re phony as fuck and couldn’t pull shit off of tow trucks
So, yo, bro, now you know my flow, so go and sit down
Or c’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down

[Hook: Artifacts with Scratches by Roc Raida]
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down
C’mon wit da c’mon, git down wit da git down

Alright, boy

Ah, man

[Cop]
Give you your rights

[Butterfly]
Here we go again

[Cop]
You have the right to remain silent

[Ladybug]
Hey Ish, what's goin on?

[Butterfly]
Chill, chill it's cool

[Cop]
Give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you

[Butterfly]
Whatever man, whatever

Do you understand each of these rights I've explained to you?

[Butterfly]
Oh, like I ever had rights, kid?

[Cop]
Do you wish to give up the right to remain silent?

[Butterfly]
Hell yeah

[Verse 1: Ladybug Mecca]
So now lets let into, in my pocket pack
Pummel and I epic, black ethic lack
I walk again, you were shade gray, come display
Mazes in black, fire in the west
Shit is shakin', it's fly
I'm in lookies when I'm pushing vinyl time
Up the Fort, where I'm caught
And my thought to shakin' up a few loose
Now I let my cause shoot, KRS One
Cause we fade in and out, are you swinging or coming?
I'm solid on this thought, this ain't living
It's heavy every setback, even when I was a shorty
Now we catch you in your four, thrice
Check me in another place, space, and joy
Nothing you could serve could ever
Ace me boy
Fat laces, I'm out, fat and no babies

""That's right baby""

[Chorus]
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right

[Verse 2: Doodlebug]
I got Harlem on my mind, Devil on my back
Brooklyn in my blood and Butter's on the track
I got insect thoughts, catch the cool ways
Clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
The jazz, the jive, the poetry
The style, the lingo, the bags of equality
Many different things try to get to me
But in a world of hard rock, I keep my humility
The funkanaut from the kingdom of not
With galactic sure shot, they can't won't don't stop
Flock to the rhythm I bring
Sing songs call survival on the Mingus revival
Scored the bass hit, with my bugged out clique
It's Doodlebug, give me love for a visual script
Sip the groove juice, it's kind of rough
Sevens never bluff, I had enough, eleven

[Chorus]
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right

[Verse 3: Butterfly]
In the east I rose
Froze in the pose
Of a land diseased
Flows that cooler summer breeze
Nikki did Kevin's braids, we got four in the 'Lac
As we swoop at warp seven, holler don't crowd cats
Cause look, corpie is the color and Butter he do it low
All you hear is poppers and rubber I'm saying oh
Man, we keep it popping on hot days
Shit, I got the fish eggs dropping any block you dip
And I dazzle that mood with the cool out, fool
Easing semi-swerve to the curb like the do
I'm fro, blow, got that right
Groove with soul and I'm still spinnin'
Cross 110 and indicate them something else
Blackest space, deepest sea
(Scoff) My shit's, a natural high, the man can't put no thing on me
Now catch me when my mind stretch out, it's astro black
Time reaching into end, nappy afro blue
We Sw-ing, fightin' out the corners
Do my tha-a-ang like Huey with it, nigga

[Chorus]
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right
That's right, sho you right

179,I Used to Love H.E.R.,Resurrection,Common,1994-10-25,278706,50,"

[Produced by No I.D.]

[Chorus]
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on

[Verse 1]
I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
‘Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, joe, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy, I tell you, I miss her

[Chorus]
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-Com Sense y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
UAC, yo, we gotta be the sure shot

[Verse 2]
Now periodically I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me
By not preachin' to me but speakin' to me
In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
She said, ""Afrocentricity was of the past""
So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung

[Chorus]
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
If you don't check it, mm-mm, bust it, bust it

[Verse 3]
I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin' bout poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed (girl, he's committed) but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop
‘Cause who I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop

[Chorus]
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
Mainframe, yo, they gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, Com Sense is gonna drop, haha

[Bridge]
I used to love H.E.R
I used to love H.E.R
I used to love H.E.R
I used to love H.E.R
I used to love H.E.R
I used to love H.E.R
I used to love H.E.R., went and fucked up all the shit, y'all

[Outro: The Five Heartbeats sample]
You ain't got your woman in check, man?
I think you’re overstepping your bounds just a little bit
I can't do this anymore

[Intro]
I would share the definition of ballin’
With you white folks, but no
The game is to be sold and not told, so fuck you

[Hook: Sample]
I'm just living and a lovin'
Waiting for the moment
When you've got time to kill

[Verse 1]
I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block
Little bad muthafucka with a pocket full of rocks
Learn to throw them thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked
And niggas laugh 'til the first muthafucka got blasted
I put that nigga in his casket
Now they covering the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular, fuck when it counts
I'm trying to make a million dollars out a quarter-ounce
And getting ghost on the 5-0—fuck them hoes
Got a .45, screaming out survival
Hey nigga, can I lay low? Cook some yayo
Holla ""one-time"" when I say so
Don't wanna go to the pen, I'm hitting fences
NARCs on a nigga's back, missing me by inches
And they say: ""How do you survive weighing 165
In a city where the skinny niggas die?""
Tell Mama ""don't cry"", 'cause even when they kill me
They can never take the game from a young G
I'm Str8 ballin'!

[Hook: Sample]
I'm just living and a lovin'
Waiting for the moment
When you've got time to kill
(Str8 ballin')
I'm just living and a lovin'
Waiting for the moment
When you've got time to kill

[Verse 2]
I'm still on parole, but I'm the first nigga serving
Pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it
But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealing
It's kinda booming 'round the way, and today I'll make a killing
Dressing down like I’m dirty, but only on the block
It's a clever disguise to keep me running from the cops
I'm getting high, I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket, but I’m riding it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip and let my music bump
Drinking liquor and I'm looking for some hoes to fuck
Rather die making money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my beyotch! Ha! And getting paid
You other muthafuckers crawlin'
But me and my muthafuckin' thug niggas—we str8 ballin'!!!

[Hook: Sample]
I'm just living and a lovin'
Waiting for the moment
When you've got time to kill
I'm just living and a lovin'
Waiting for the moment
When you've got time to kill

Look here, y'all know what time it is
This the part where y'all loc up
You now what I'm sayin'? Str8 ballin'
Doing 55, nigga, do time
The police right behind
They can't see me, they wanna be me
Str8 muthafuckin' ballin'
Start letting it off, nigga, this '94, and niggas want mo'
We str8 ballin'
That's how it's goin down my muthafuckin' nigga
Bulletproof vests and all, you know?

[Verse 3]
I'm damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
So watch a young motherfucker pull a trigger just to raise up!
But don't let them see you cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga, time to do or die
I keep a pistol in my pocket, ready
On my block, ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
And I done seen a muthafucka’ peep pain
At point-blank range 'cause he slept on the game
And ain't a damned thing changed
You shaking the dice, now roll 'em
If you can't stand pain, better hold 'em
'Cause ain't no telling what you might roll
You might fold, catch AIDS from a slight cold, nigga
Best to live your life to the fullest
Be quick to kill the bull
Got a pistol, motherfucker, better pull it
'Cause even when they kill me
They can never take the game from a young G
We str8 ballin'!

They have you niggas believe you bout to die
When we really coming up like a muthafucka

If you want it, pursue it!
We can handle the shit
It's time for niggas to stay ballin'!
We made this muthafucka! For who?

To my niggas in the penitentiary
Loc up like a motherfucka when they mention me
'Cause you fuckin' with the realest motherfucka ever born

I'm busting on these bitches 'til they gone
Now who the hell can you get to stop me?
I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse
I keep my Glock cocked, nigga, 'cause they all shady
I finally made it, now these jealous bitches trying to fade me!
I ain't going out, I'd rather blast back
I'm on the corner with my niggas watching cash stack
And I came up a long way from food stamps
And taking shit from these low-life ghetto tramps
How could you blame me? If they sweat me I'mma open fire!
What could I do? Pull my trigger or watch my nigga die
I'm representing to the fullest, giving devils slugs
I'm on the block slanging drugs with the young thugs
And motherfucka, we be ballin'!
All motherfuckin' day long! Stay strong!
We straight ballin'

[Hook: Blue Raspberry] (x2)
When I first stepped on the scene, niggas was petrified
Jet back to the lab like they were being chased by homicide
My rap flow does you right Tical
And it will never steer you wrong
And all you bitch-ass niggas in the industry
Your careers won't be lasting long

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Check it, I'm the fucking man, who they mention
Noticed that other niggas rap styles is bogus
Doo-doo compared to this versatile voodoo
Blazing, the stuff that ignites stimulation
Inside ya, cause I be that hell sure provider
Providing the rhyme that be deep as The Poseidon Adventure
Niggas need to test they freaking tincture
For the sickness that be spreading with the quickness
Remedies, cousin I be doing on my enemy
Penalty, then I drink forties to they memories
Emotion, coursing through your town street vicinity
Blunt smoke in the air reveals my identity

[Break: Method Man]
(Tical.... tical... ti-cal, ti-cal...)
As I keep it moving, we keep it moving, uh
Keep it moving, and keep it moving, uh
Keep it moving, baby, we be moving, uh
Keep it moving, we keep it—huh, rhahhrh!

[Bridge: Method Man]
What's that rhythm, what's that sound?
Party people getting down
When it hit no doubt about
Just release yo' delf

[Verse 2: Method Man]
My God, somebody said, it's on—if it is, then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up with my five fingers of death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand if you fronting
On any man down with the Clan, I be coming
For the headpiece you can't cope
For my brother, I bring it to the Pope, word to mother
Serial killer style from the Isles of Stat'
My peoples are you with me, where you at?
Shit's getting deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas lookin' all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the floor
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
What is it? Niggas think they bigger
Because they got their finger on the trigger of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked when I start to kick it
Eat they raw sound, wash it down with a Mistic
Better yet a Snapple
Nigga want the juice but he don't want the hassle
So we're trying to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple I'm coming to your town black down
The rental car, the pistol cocked
If you don't want to burn from the Glock
Then beware, I buck shots, meaning what?
The buck stops here, no more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by who?

[Bridge: Method Man]
What's that rhythm, what's that sound?
Party people getting down
When it hit no doubt about
Just release yo' delf

Aight (Aight), aight (Aight)
I'm aight if you aight (I'm aight)
I be better - get some of that bass
(Word, give it up aight)
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah
Booty quaking, body shaking
'Nough attacking brain's a-racking
Clock tocking Chuck rocking
Flavor Flav ain't never shaving
(One, two, three. four, hit it!)

[Verse 1]
It's another record, check it, mad method
To put my brothers and sisters on a deathbed
You know he cheated, took what he wanted, but now you blunted
Suckin' up to the devil, steppin' down a level
It's who they fear is you
Who protects us from us and you from you
Yes and it counts, fuck the forty ounce
I sued them bastards, yeah they got bounced
I did 'em like a demo (Threw 'em out the window!)
I took a 98 'cause I never liked a limo
But pump, pump, pump, pu-pump, pump it up
A mad rhyme for mad times, that's what's up
Some ain't gonna change, I got 'em in a range
I gotta rearrange, so I'm buildin' back ya brain
Wreckin' records with funky stuff
Am I loud enough? (Yeah!) You got to give it up

[Chorus]
Give it up, give it up, give it up, yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up

[Verse 2]
Come again with the same old bounce
I'm callin' a foul and once again it counts
Mad tense, mad tense, brothers know
The blunts in the back got the black behind and that's whack
And once again, it's on
Hey Jimmy cracked corn cracker singin', ""I don't care,"" it's on
I'm comin' with a rhyme (What?), I'm lettin' go a rhyme (Yeah!)
I gotta get a rhyme through the rough and crazy times
Call me a Hannibal lecture, yes I checked her
They don't hear me though, so here I go
I'm sick and tired, so Sly'll take ya higher
While I'm taking his sound to bring you down
Rappers rippin' a lyrical kickin', finger-lickin'
But to the rhythm, I'm givin', but never cotton pickin'
Like James Brown, I'm sayin' it loud
Am I loud enough? Huh, you got to give it up

Some ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change
Some ain't gonna never ever change (Louder!)
Some ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change

Give it up, give it up, give it up, now

And when I'm comin', some numb, dumb, and fulla cum
Some second guessing my lessons about saving young
Some don't know, like Run said, so here we go (Yeah!)
Where it is inside, whoop there it is, there it is
There it is, damn rightMy man X is a bad mother (Shut your mouth!)
I'm talking about Terminator, he's the man!
There it is, can you hit me off with another one?

Give it up, give it up, give it up, now
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
I never did represent doing dumb shit
No gangsta lyin', I'd rather diss Presidents
Dead or alive, bring 'em and I'll swing 'em
I vocalize, I just rap, I don't sing 'em
Flick 'em and I fling 'em, you can go with 'em
Hall of Fame for the game for the points, I Dave Bing 'em
Go Grandmama, close but no cigar
I got mine, for I'm using my rhyme
The flow go wherever I want, and that's clever
Give a piece of my time, to prevent some crime
And who's behind putting the guns to the young ones?
The ones that make 'em is the ones that take 'em
Rugged for no reason, down in duck season
I don't want my mama, on the street wearing armor
So check yourself before ya wreck yourself
Respect yourself, ha, you gotta give it up

[Verse 1: Tame One]
I'm out to bomb like Vietnam under the same name Tame One
The bad one, ink flow master bastard with the Magnum
I tags up quick and then I steps to the exit
When it's time to get sess-ted, or flex on some fresh shit
Some wack crook stole my black book, I know who took it
I know his whole tag because the fag writes his name crooked
The ink I use might stink but you gotta think
I got my props, Hoppes, 'cause my tags don't shrink
I'm tagging and bagging bitches 'cause my name is famous in the street
'Cause they know my name's from cruising in the Jeeps
So, yo, grab a can and put your man up and stand up
For the fresh never-stale niggas off the third rail
Deep, dark and black like the Magnum I pack
It's that Artifacts chat from the wrong side of da tracks

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
The Artifacts are from the wrong, side of da tracks
The Artifacts are from the wrong side

[Verse 2: El Da Sensai]
I load my backpack with spray paints and markers to spark the
Tag'll never drip, I catch the path, take a trip
To the train yards and think back, when I used to write that
Shit that used to hit, had all the mad color tips
Breaking was my thing, I used to spin the back
I never thought I'd spin the wax
With tracks to make your hands clap
I could've went the other way, but no haps
I got my dap on the map with the Bic down to a spray cap
Niggas used to doubt to my clout but now I turn 'em out
They shout my shout out uptown like they wanna be down
Avoid the crowds that wanna stab me in the back, enough of that
Watch the third rail track 'cause I don't wanna get zapped
Pieces I burn to show my name, no shame
Don't wanna put the blame down on my nigga Tame
Brothers don't wanna see me grow to get my cash flow
I have no remorse, so check me out in The Source

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
The Artifacts are from the wrong, side of da tracks
The Artifacts are from the wrong side

[Verse 3: Tame One & El Da Sensai]
I burn my name up quick like a Thai stick
As red as my eyes get, I still rocks the fly shit
Back with some ultra flat black catchin' wreck in a sec
Wet paint, ain't shit, when I'm on the set
I'm live like the third rail, on time like a PATH train
The name Tame alone got fame so fuck a last name
I tags mad when I drag a fat sack of ism
Comin out with New Editions like Mike Bivins
I get a sticker from my nigga with the bag of em
Write my name on em then I peel off the back of em
And stick em to victims of underground systems
Let the toys bring the noise, me and my boys are gonna diss em
In conclusion don't snooze when two niggas from the Jerz
Kick the mad graffiti slurs and kick the bass to the curb
The Artifacts Jack, bringin the art of facts back
Some seem to forget about the ebony that caught wreck
So remember this you're tender when you slip in to enter
The Artifacts zone cause graffiti's still prone
To kick ass pizazz slash let me tag
Why is that black? Because the wack jack was known as a fag
So don't cross the path that's the gat to your back
The Artifacts out, wrong side of da tracks

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
The Artifacts are from the wrong, side of da tracks
The Artifacts are from the wrong side

Ain't nothing I seen him in the club, acting like he won't, no
Where around that's when I found out that you was nothing
For me and all the love that you said that you had

Bit unless you pull out the fat, crispy

I got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 2: Numskull]
I take sacks to the
Face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa to burn
Slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)
‘Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the
Joint, stop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
‘Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P. O
I know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a
Fatty, but the Tanqueray straight had me

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it; grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 3: Numskull]
Ayy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk

[Verse 4: Yukmouth]
I been smoked
Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down up in the O-A-K
The Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, ‘cause where I be we needs half, like Umfufu

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it; grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack

[Intro]
You are appreciated

[Verse 1]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 2]
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hotplate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 3]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Chorus: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin, 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)
Lady, lady

Make it last forever, damn the kitty cat's tight
Mmm... daddy slow down your flow
Put it on me like G baby nice and slow
I need a rough neck nigga, Mandingo in the sack
Who ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back

But do you really think that you can work it out?
I guarantee shorty it's real, baby stick it out

Mad tight
The only thing left to do is climax
Let's make it last
Word we ain't goin' out like that
All this time you've been telling that you was a Don
I tried to warn you, girl, you wouldn't listen
Now let's get it on
Mmm, baby wild, don't do that
Chill wait a minute baby let me please you back
You talk a good one shorty now you're makin' me sweat

Baby, I wanna hit it in the worst way
Make it hot
Schemin' on the ass since the first day
Don't stop
Damn I love it when you talk like that
Make it bounce sugar
Long as you can bounce me back
More flesh than the Greek Fest
Roll up the sess
Pass the Hennessy
Put my body to the test
Wait wait daddy many niggas ago
I was a young girl listening to how you flow
Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown
From the back, from the side
Right, I'm in the zone
One of a kind when it's time to do mine
Camcorder and the whole shit
Press rewind
Let it flow on the screen while we puffs the L
Layin back in the cut while we're under the spell
Word life, I like the way the ep went down
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown
We'll be

[Intro]
The Wild, ha-ha
The Wild West
Ha, ride

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
Ready for the showdown to go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's past noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fights dirty
But I'ma put 30 inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
You never met me, you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head too
'Cause when you-

[Chorus]
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
He was shady, I seen by the look on his face
He said, ""Take ten paces,"" shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
You need bullets, hurry up, run
I put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do? It's on you
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?
(The Chronic)
Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it
Who?
Some old dude who's got 26 plaques
And he already sold two
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
Dre, here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us
Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin'
He ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well-respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun-slingin'
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a ""G Thang""
And a verse from ""Keep Their Heads Ringin'""
I said, ""It's Dre's day,"" and started to spray
It's 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled

[Chorus]
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
The life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die (Always die)

Shit is thumping, ear drums pumping
The shit is type hype cause the sample is tight right
Bite this one and leave teethless
Never sweat that

Peep this - give up the loot
It's '94 and bitch ass niggas yeah they still get the boot
The Northlakes cause I be flowing in all states
Show kept digging and digging now he got more crates

I betcha I'm a getcha, the number one heart stresser
Sorry black, that's right it's a cardiac arrest
Try to triple team the best?
Then where's Party at?
Lost to no one, a warrior like Shogun
And when the show's done stacks and stacks is how the hoes come
I bruise your feelings, confidence is to the ceiling
If I'm sick, I pick a chick for sexual healing
I'm unique, a freak like Malik
In the twilights with more highlights than Dominique
Around my boys is where the jel stops
Up to the streets, the jeeps, my peeps in the cell blocks
I'm not the best but I give you stress
To flatter me your strategy gotta be more complex than chess
Stop bluffing cause you ain't saying nothing, G
And start ducking I'm the A to the fucking G
Last LP we got down right
Showed all these corny motherfuckers what hip-hop's supposed to sound like
See A.G. and the brother Show
Quiet as kept it's best that you step on the low

Well it's me meaning the A to the dash
I'm fast to get the cash now I'm gone like the past
What's the remedy?
Suckers better get they own identity
And to the enemy, you better roll like it's ten of me
Fake lords they get strangled with mic cords
Taking beats from my LP for sure ain't healthy
Patterson Projects is where I rest
But I claim the whole planet cos it's mine goddamn it
I'm God, quick to pull a fake brother card
Wrecked Boston, running shit in Portland like Rod
It's hard to face defeat when you're raised in the street
No surrender and no retreat
Now dance with the devil? No not hardly
Even though I mamba like La Bamba and smoke ganja like Bob Marley
A bag of ces puts me at my rest
You say it's silly, that's my theory
Get the philly and let it rest

Ill speakin' scud missile, heat-seekin'
Johnny Blazin', nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunnin', my third eye seen it comin' before it happened
You know about them fuckin' Staten kids, they smashin'
Everything, huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talkin' 'bout they blastin', hmm
Is you bustin' steel or is you flashin'? Hmm
Talkin' out yo' asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy Afro
Ticallion stallion, the chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it movin', know just what the fuck I'm doin'
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozin'
Slip the cardiac, arrest me, exorcist hip-hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my steez

And your reach ain't rugged enough, bitch

[Verse 2: GZA]
Yo, I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfuckin' backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, tryna orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect ya neck, my sword still remains imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year 'round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately, if not soon
Set the lynchin', inform the execution date
As this 2000 beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty G's a session

[Verse 3: Method Man]
When my mind start to clickin'
And the strategy is mastered, the plot thicken
This be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' fuck
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat, protect the dome
Look at mama's baby boy actin' like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee that be holdin' down his honeycomb, loungin', son
Wu brother number one
Protect your neck, flyin' guillotines, here they come
Bloody bastards, hard times and killer tactics
Spittin' words plus semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle
Hit the clutch, shift the gear, now full throttle
Time to bungee to the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spittin' lunghies
At a wack nigga that don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks, I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat', Killa Hill Projects, how to be exact
Break it down, all in together now
Things are gettin' good, lookin' better now
...and some other shit

To my man, Killer B
No doubt indeed
Where that weed?
Nomsayin'?

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me
The Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Chorus: Havoc]
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Verse 2: Havoc]
I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
But never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged
That fucked me up, God, but shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples
When you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two to four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get
I'm stayin' in the projects forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot—fuck lookin' cute!
I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize

[Chorus: Mobb Deep]
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

Word is bond, I leave mics torn when I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!
Come on, put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn!
Come on, put it on, Big L, put it on!
Come on, put it on, represent, put it on, Come on!

[Verse 2: Big L]
Nobody can take nothin' from Big L but a loss, chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti
(You don't know?) you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Haha, you's a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin' competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catchin' wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo, it's a must that I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
Yeah, so put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, big fella, put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L!
Put it on, represent!
Put it on, c'mon, put it on!

[Bridge: Patois Chatta]
Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy, you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead from a me you provoke

[Verse 3: Big L]
I drink Moët, not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean, I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin' rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
'Cause I be hangin' in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread
You can't kill me, I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slammin', I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
'Cause we put it on, adiós, ghost, I'm gone

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it on, big fella put it on and onnn!
Big L, you gotta put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L put it on ond on!
Word up, knahmsayin?
My man Big L, runnin' things for the nine-four
And nine-oh-s, you know what I mean?
It's the Kid Capri, in full flair
And we gon' put it on a little somethin' like this
Big L, c'mon!

[Outro: Big L & (Kid Capri)]
Lord Finesse (He be puttin' it on)
My man Buckwild (He be puttin' it on and on)
My man Fat Joe (He be puttin' it on)
Showbiz and A.G. (Yeah, they be puttin' it on and on)
I can’t forget Diamond D (He be puttin' it on)

And of course Kid Capri (Yeah, I be puttin' it on)
The whole N.Y.C. (Yeah, we be puttin' it on and on)

L.O.D
Keith Murray
Def Squad (Def Squad)
Mister, Mister, Mister, Mister Smith
You want a hit?
(Ugh)
Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad
Yo

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
And let my balls hang like I'm on a toilet taking a shit
My style is all that and a big bag of chips with the dip (Drip)
Fuck all that sensuous shit (Drip)
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your clique holier than the Ten Commandments
Like Redman, I shift with the ruck
If your ""if"" was a spliff, we'd be all fucked up (Word up)
No need to ask you, ""Who is he?"" Son I get busy
Scuff my Timbs on the boulevard on many rough cities
(Chicago, LA, any of 'em) I'll have to Norman Bate you (Yeah)
I love ta hate you cause you's a freak by nature
Can't wait to face ya, mutilate ya
Drink your style down straight with no chaser (Word up)
My verbal combat's like a mini-Mac to your back (Uh-huh)
As soon as one of you niggas try to over react (Blaow!)
The L.O.D. love good confrontation or vamp (Word up)
Break your concentration, murder your camp (Ugh)
For the jealous, overzealous, we fellas
Blow the the spot like Branford Marsalis (Bom-bom-bom)
Niggas coming through and acting wild (Word)
Y'all commercial niggas better have a Coke and a smile
I shot ya!

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
I conversate with many men (What), it's time to begin again
Forgot what I already knew, ayo, you hear me friend?
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Secret society, trying to keep they eye on me (Nah, nah)
But I'ma stay incogni', in places they can't find me
Make my moves strategically, the G.O.D
It's sorta similar but iller than a chess player
I use my thinker, it coincides with my blinker
While you wondered what we saying on the records real (What)
Yeah, you motherfucking right, kid, you know the deal
My Mobb is Infamous just like the fuckin' title read
You get back-slapped so hard, make ya nose bleed (Ahh!)
Some def kids feeling guilty 'bout the space shit
The truth hurts, baby girl, so just face it (Alright)
But anyway, back on the real side of things
My niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing (Kid)
Everything is real, not just a song that we sing (Word up)
From my life to the paper (What), very accurately
Give you all of my two so maybe you can three
Prodigy will forever will S-H-I-N-E (Shine, baby, shine, shine, yeah)
My shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me (What)
Without acknowledging this man as G-O-D
I shot your faggot ass

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Ugh, now, who the fuck you think you talking to?
I pay dues, I spray crews
Look, I'm Joey Crack, motherfuckers be like, ""He's bad news""
Runnin this racket, from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people, bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
I'd rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitch-ass niggas know we stronger than these weaklings
Seeking for respect that ain't there
Knuckleheads beware, there's mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun, shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulette, this man's wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razor—which I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spat out at any adult that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Mad at the fact that somebody's getting lucci that's not Caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture
Joey Crack a.k.a. Keyser Söze

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
What the deal, pop? Ugh
Thug niggas give they minks to chinks, tore down
We sip drinks, rockin' minks, flashin' rings and things (On the real)
Frontin' hardcore deep inside the Jeep, mackin'
Doin' my thing, fly nigga, you a Scarface king (Ugh)
Bitches grab ya ta-tas, get them niggas for they cheddar
Fuck it, Gucci sweaters and Armani leathers (Ugh)
Flossin' rocks like the size of Fort Knox
Four carats, the ice rocks, pussy bangin' like Versace locs, pops (So what the deal)
Wanna creep? Open like raw asscheeks
I'm sexin' raw-dog without protection, disease infested, ugh!
Italiano got the Luccianno
I gets down, fuckin' with Brown, Fox, extra keys to the drop
Boo, I'm jingling, baby (Ugh, yeah yeah)
I got crazy Dominicans who pay me to lay low, I play slow
Roll with The Firm, Mafioso crime kingpin
It all real, nigga, what the deal? I shot ya!

[Verse 5: LL Cool J]
What the fuck? I thought I conquered the world
Crushed Moe Dee (Ugh), Hammer, and Ice-T's girls
But still, niggas want to instigate shit
I'll battle any nigga in the rap game quick
Name the spot, I make it hot for you bitches
Female rappers too, I don't give a fuck, boo
Word, I'm here to crush all my peers
Rhymes of the month in The Source for twenty years
Niggas scared, I'm detrimental to your mental state
I use my presidential Rolex to be the bait
Niggas fight, Glock cocked, ya temple gets fucked
MCs that fuck with LL, they gets bucked
That's real, what's up with that ""I Shot Ya"" deal?
Light shit, niggas slip, now, how the bullet feel?
New York'll peel, in L.A., they gangbang
But if you touch a mic, your motherfuckin ass hang
That's facts, niggas don't receive no type of slack
'Cause if they do (Ugh), they ass is always runnin' back (Yeah)
Not this time, but next time, I'ma name names
L.L., shitting from on top of the game
I shot ya!

198,Me Against The World,Me Against The World,2Pac,1995-03-14,279133,60,"

[Chorus: 2Pac]
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is out for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby

[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
'Cause it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well

[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world

[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world

[Outro: 2Pac]
Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But, uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, honey dip, summertime fine, Jheri dripping
Seen you on Pitkins with a bunch of chickens how you're cliquing
I kept shooting strong notes as we got close
She rocked rope, honey throat smelling like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a freshwater scrod, or may I not be God?
Attitude is very rude, boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vine's Cee Allah Rule
They call me Starky Love, hon, check the strategy
By any means, Shirley Temple curls was done by Billie Jeans
Black Mrs. America, your name is Erica, right, true
Lazy eyeball, small feet, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smelling like cinnamon
Excuse me, hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again
Goddamn, backyard's banging like a Benzi
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spuds McKenzie
I'm high-powered, put Adina Howard to sleep
Yo, pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week
But, uh, back to you, Maybelline queen, let's make a team
You can have anything in this world except cream
So what you wanna do? What you wanna do?
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu

Yo, I'm lounging big dick style, y'all niggas is the flyest
Moves you're making, too fly, jewels are shaking
Not a rape patient, you're looking good, fly-colored Asian
Ghettoes, them is your hometown
We can go the whole round
After that, I'm shooting downtown
I'm rocking hats and your wig is all intact
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes pearly black?
Freaks be moving in fly sneaks
Two-finger rings and gold teeth and ain't afraid to hold heat
So when I step in the square, dear
You better have cream to share, Ricans, ven aqui, yeah

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
Scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Black chocolate girl wonder, shake ground like thunder
Politic to your deficit step, give me your number
Your sexy persuasive tatas and thighs
Catch my eyes like pies, I want your bodily surprise
Double down some time
Ice cream, you got me falling out like a cripple
I love you like I love my dick size
Ooh, baby, I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the Dutches
Orgasm in my mind-state, masturbate in your clutches
I want you for self like wealth, so play me closely
Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me?
Only a hard dozen wanna be calling me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby, shopping spree you're loving
Call me if you wanna get dug like the pockets
I jizz 'em like a giant, break wombs out of the sockets

[Pre-Chorus: Method Man]
Wu-Tang in the cut, for real niggas, what?

Scooped in the ice cream truck, who tears it up
Ice cold bitches melt down when in the clutch
They want they titties sucked, ice cream

[Outro: Method Man]
One love to my chocolate deluxes
Keep your nails done and your wigs tight, word up
One love to my butter pecan Ricans for calling me papi

One love to caramel sundaes with the cherries on top, yeah

You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
Lyrically splittin', dismissin'
I'm on a mission of just hittin'
Now it's written and kitten hittin' with mittens
I'm missin', wishin', man, listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishin'
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded, I said it, word
Damn, you nerd, man, you heard
Comin' from the town of Illy and alleys
Are full of Phillies and Rallys
Suckers get silly as Sally
Then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really
So here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me... flow
Never mixin' with trickin' brothers bitchin'
Over vixens that ain't fittin' to be hittin'
For nothin', splittin' things that's bitten and gettin' written off
You're like a fatter half bladder, boy, you pissin' me off
Before you even started, so what, so long, see you fly by, my try
How else could I say it when you play it, try boom-bye-bye
Bye-bye!

Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

The flow pro poetical with skills only a vet'll know
Better know where's the wetter flow that's on point like decimals
Manhandlin' new crews
Partyin' with the Zoo Crew
Lookin' for the pink in boo boo's, I thought you knew too
Stone style's of stamina
Jammin' to while we plannin' to jam
We bust, plus we're the party amateur damagers
Managin', damagin' mics, men and even mannequins
You're a fan again
Now I wanna know, who's the man again?
Naughty's back like vertebraes
Word to hey-a-ho, the way I show, you pray I flow
Steady breakin' to the boogie so bang time
To slang, bang and watch all the poo-tang tangs hang

[Hook: Treach]
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

[Verse 3: Treach]
Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
Then beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully, chase bass-lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's 'nuff poo-tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up
Get up, get up your with up
Souped up, put your dukes up, no guts set up for sit-ups
Flip up, watch us rip up
Shake shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like you're with us
If not, zip up your lip up
Whip up hits with ransoms, foul styles get and ones
We came back 'cause we heard hip-hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah, in fact and fo' ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flow-ers
Repin' these since the '70s, find me
So we went crazy in the '80s
So we won't kiss heinies in the '90s
Oops, the Naughty's, troops in sections with forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty, I'm Naughty

[Chorus]
Drop!

[Verse 1: Bootie Brown]
Let me freak the funk, obsolete is the punk
That talks more junk than Sanford sells
I jet propel at a rate, that complicate their mental state
As I invade their Masquerade, they couldn't fade with a clipper blade
10 years in the trade is not enough, you can't cut it
I let you take a swing, and you bunted for an easy out
I leave emcees with doubt of exceeding
My name is Bootie Brown and I'm proceeding, leading
They try to follow but they're shallow and hollow
I can see right through them like an empty 40 bottle of O.E
They have no key or no clue
To the game at all, now they washed up
Hung out to dry
Stand there looking stupid, wondering why
(why man?)
It was the fame, that they tried to get
Now they walking around talkin' about represent
And keep it real, but I got to appeal
'Cause they existing in a fantasy when holding the steel

[Chorus]
Drop!

[Verse 2: SlimKid3]
Rock-a-bye baby
Listen to your heartbeat pumping to a fine
Ravine of all things it's a vain of a shrine
All missions impossible are possible, 'cause I'm
Headed for a new sector 365
Days from now, I'll wipe the sweat from my eye
And each and every true will stick or fall from the skies
Of my cloud nine
From homies all the way to chicks, no matter how fine
Controlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
You hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
Tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
Every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance
And the world's at a standstill, deep in broken-man's-ville
Trapped in the moat with an anvil, still
Killing yourself, and dogging ya health
You ain't amphibious, so grab a hold of yourself

[Verse 3: Imani]
(Shit is-shit is ill)
But through my will, my flow still will spill
Toxic slick to shock sick like electrocute
When I execute acutely over the rhythm
On those that pollute, extra dosages is what I gotta give 'em
Got 'em mad and tremblin'
'Cause I been up in my lab assemblin'
Missiles to bomb the enemy
Because they envy me and the making of my mad currency
Currently I think we're in a state of an emergency
'Cause niggas done sold their souls, and now their souls is hollow
And I think they can't follow
They can't swallow the truth because it hurts
This is how I put it down, this is my Earth, my turf
The worth of my birth is a billion
And you know what time it is I'm gonna make a million
Yeah, you know what time is it?
Yeah, uh huh, you know what time is it?
Yeah, uh huh, you know what time is it?
Yeah, uh huh, you know what time?

I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely sippin' on bubbly)

[Verse 1: AZ]
At times, I window-watch out the Mariott
Zonin' on ownin' co-ops, foreign drop-top coupes and yachts
Guzzlin' straight shots of scotch
Formulatin' up plots to escape from 'Salem's Lot
'Cause it's scorchin' hot
Makin' it hard tryin' to figure who's out to trap me
Pataki, got all kinds of undercovers that's comin' at me
Perhaps he, won't be happy 'til they snatch me
And place me where half us blacks be, sittin' in Coxsackie
But never me, see, my destiny's to be forever free
In ecstasy, on a hill that awaits for me
So plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make livin' this a must, plus, it's real...

[Chorus: Miss Jones]
I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely sippin' on bubbly)

[AZ in background]
Ayo son, pull the shades down and let's count this money
Put the Grants in the safe, 'cause we spendin' the Jackson's
The Washington's go to wifey, you know how we do

[Verse 2: AZ]
No more cuttin' grams and wrappin' grands up in rubber bands
I'm a recovered man, our plan's to discover other lands
Suburban places got me seekin' for oasis
Cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime faces
Sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas
Though this ain't promised, I'm as determined as them old timers
I want a villa in a Costa Rica
So I can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life's supposed to treat ya
Laid in the shades of the everglades, finally forever paid
Wearin' the finest fabrics tailors ever made
Me and my team, Caribbean cuisines
I guess bein' down for so long, I'm all in store to see my dreams

[Chorus: Miss Jones]
I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely sippin' on bubbly)

[Verse 3: AZ]
So until I see past the green pasture
Me bein' supreme master, ain't much more life to fiend after
But another chapter, a new way of life to adapt to
'Cause these streets'll gas ya, and have ya caught up in the rapture
Déjà vu, I could vision my killer crew more hospitable
Consciously aware plus political (Political..)
'Cause though they claim every man's created equal
Us as native people, find it harder for nights to sleep through
But once established, we eatin' lovely, livin' lavish
Like the House of Versailles in Paris, I gotta have this
It's so plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make livin' this a must, plus, it's real...

[Chorus: Miss Jones]
I wanna chill (Chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh, he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely sippin' on bubbly)

It's so crazy, I'm down with AZ
It's so lovely sippin' on bubbly
It's so crazy, Jones and AZ
It's so lovely sippin' on bubbly (Woooooo!!)
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill, baby
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill, baby
I wanna chill, I wanna chill
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill, baby

203,How High (Remix),Blackout!,Method Man,1999-01-01,282506,47,"

[Intro]
[Erick Sermon] Latest record? You stole it from somebody else
[Redman] Takin' it from the top?
[Erick Sermon] Hell yeah, we takin' it from the top
[Redman] Tippy? All my people
[Method Man] Sing it, daddy
[Redman] Hey, uh

Fly Robin Fly...Fly Robin Fly...Fly Robin Fly...Up, up to the sky

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocketful a rye
Who the fuck wanna die for their culture
Stalk the dead body like a vulture
Ticallion, HMMM
Blacker than your blackest stallion
Hit your housing projects
I represent yo Shaolin my nigga
Hell yes, Apocalypse Now, the gun blaow
It be goin down, diggy diggy down, diggy down down

[Verse 2: Redman]
While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
When I raise my trigger finger all y'all niggas hit the deck
'Cause ain't no need for that, hustlers and hardcore
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs
The Green-Eyed Bandit can't stand it
With more Fruitier Loops then that Toucan Sam bitch
Plus, the Bombazee got me wide...
(Messin' with them) is a straight suicide

[Chorus: Method Man, Redman, Erick Sermon]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
(It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' (lah) on the train)
How high? (So high that I can kiss the sky)
(""Up, up to the sky"")
(Yeah, check it out y'all)
(Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane)
Recognize Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
(How high?) So high that I can kiss the sky
(""Up, up to the sky"")
(Yeah, yeah, Tical)

[Verse 3: Method Man]
10 9 8 7 6 5 4
3 2 Murder 1 lyric at your door
Tical bring it to that ass raw
Breaking all the rules like glass jaws
Nigga, you got to get mine to get yours
Fucka, we don't need no rap tour
I'd rather kick the facts and catch you with the rap-ture
More than you bargained for
Tical, that stays open like an all night store
For real, I keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
And end your existence, M-E-T
Ain't no use for resistance, H-O-D

[Verse 4: Redman, Method Man]
I's be the ultimate rush to any nigga on dust
The Egyptian musk used to have me pull mad sluts
I shift like a clutch with the Ruck
Examine my nuts, I don't stop 'til I get enough
Yo shit broke down, light your flair
Since the dark side tears you into Hollywood Squares
Six million ways to die, so I chose
Made it six million and one with your eyes closed
The blindfold, cold, so you can feel the wrath
And shatter the glass and second half on your monkey ass
Ayo my man (Tical) hear me now
Bitches used to play me now they can't forget me now
Forget me not, I rock the spot, check Glock
Empty off a lickin' off in hip-hop
Fuck the Billboard, I'm a bullet on my block
How you dope when you paid for your Billboard spot?

[Chorus: Method Man, Redman, Erick Sermon]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
(It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' (lah) on the train)
How high? (So high that I can kiss the sky)
(""Up, up to the sky"")
(Yeah, yeah, ha, word up)

[Verse 5: Method Man]
As I run a mile with a racist
My style was born in the pissy staircases
Dig it, eff a rap critic
He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt, I'm the second one to hit it

[Verse 6: Redman]
Look up in the, I got the verbs, nouns and Glocks in ya
Enter the center, lyrics bang like Rico-chet Rabbit
I bring havoc with an A-K matic
Rollin blunts an all day habit
I get it on like Smiff and Wess'
Who click's the best?
Punks take a sip and test
Who splits your vest?
The funk phenomenon
I'm bombin' you like Lebanon
Flow canals of Panama just off stamina

[Chorus: Method Man, Redman, Erick Sermon]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
(It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' (lah) on the train)
How high? (So high that I can kiss the sky)
(""Up, up to the sky"")
(Yeah, ha, ha, yeah, yeah)
(Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane)
Recognize Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
(How high?) So high that I can kiss the sky
(""Up, up to the sky"")
(Yeah yeah, word up)
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
(It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' (lah) on the train)
How high? (So high that I can kiss the sky)
(""Up, up to the sky"")

204,MC's Act Like They Don't Know,KRS-One,KRS-One,1995-10-10,295933,55,"

[Intro]
Clap your hands everybody, if you got what it takes
'Cause I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks
Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Of course we don't flip flop

[Verse 1]
If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, ""Ill""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer

[Chorus]
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know

[Verse 2]
This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it

[Chorus]
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know

[Verse 3]
Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
Cos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tango with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like Artifacts
On the Wrong Side of Da Tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad izm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em

[Chorus]
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know

205,So Many Tears,Me Against The World,2Pac,1995-03-14,239226,62,"

[Intro]
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

[Refrain]
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, I'll shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

[Verse 3]
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come

[Refrain]
Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

[Verse 4]
And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord, lost so many years
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered many years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

206,Ain't Nobody,Mr. Smith (Deluxe Edition),LL Cool J,1995-11-20,277440,46,"

[Produced by Rashad Smith]

[Intro: LL Cool J]
Oh my God, you know

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
I'm the best when it comes to makin' love all night
Throw your butterscotch body beneath the red light
Blaze it up girl, I'ma lace it real tight
Go deep 'til the full moon turn to sunlight
'Til the darkness is gone love remains strong
Like the bond between mother and child, you're so warm to the touch
Passionate interludes is such
When your gone, your body's what I yearn to clutch
Just imagine ecstasy floatin' in a cloud
Animal attraction burnin' through the crowd
Heaven on Earth, paradise for a price
It's cool though, I'll pay it for the rest of my life, you know why

[Chorus: Chaka Khan sample (LL Cool J)]
Ain't nobody does me better
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody does me better
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
I'm explorin' your body and your erogenous zones
Like a black tiger caged up, 'til you come home
Lovely, you make a man swoon like a boy
The love is so soft, it gets hard to enjoy
Cause the mind flies, and sometimes the sex lies
Smooth little girls fall in love with rough guys
But you can chop a big heart down to pint size
I guess that's what it sounds like when the dove cries
Uh, the whole world is trapped up in a maze
But you save this real good lovin' for rainy days
Uh, the lord works in mysterious ways
He must have put you on this Earth for all men to praise

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
As I travel through your body our souls become one
Indivisible, uh, it's getting critical son
I'm on the run from love, it chased me out the bag
Get the point boo, you hit it right on the head
It's an endless adventure, two bodies collide
King fulfilling dreams with a queen by his side
Forever, infinite time we intertwine
Destiny, we fall in love by design
What's yours is mine and what's mine is yours
The road less travelled is ours to explore
I adore you, heavenly angel shine light
Hold my hand, I'll be your guide through the night

[Chorus]

[Interlude: LL Cool J]
Come on now, a man chooses a woman
A woman chooses a man, give you half for a second
Then I'll give you the full plunge, uh
What you want? What you want? What you want?
Ice out infiltrates the scenery, nahmean
It's bananas ain't it

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away

[Verse 1: Fatlip]
I must admit on some occasions
I went out like a punk and a chump
Or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect I used to never get
Cause all I got was upset
When niggas used to be like
(""What's up, fool?! Nigga, what's up?!"")
And tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip
For no reason at all I can recall niggas throwing Cs in my face
Down the hall I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at three
Wondering, ""Why is everybody always pickin' on me?
I tried to talk and tell them, chill, I did nothin' to deserve this
But when it didn't work, I wasn't scared, just real nervous and unprepared
To deal with scrappin' no doubt
My pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out
But now in '95 I must survive as a man on my own
Fuck around with Fatlip, yes, ya get blown
I'm not tryin' to show, no macho is shown
But when it's on, if it's on, then it's on

[Hook]
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away

[Verse 2: Slim Kid Tre]
One, two... so listen here...
There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta handle shit up on his own
Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
Please, they got problems of their own
Down for the count on seven chickenshits don't get to heaven
Til they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked back up in high school, I played it cool
Just so some real shit won't get full blown bein' where I'm from
They let the smoke come quicker than an evil redneck
Could lynch a helpless colored figure and
As a victim I invented low-key
Till the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my free form form free
Said I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me
I don't sweat it, I let the bullshit blow in the breeze
In other words, just debris

[Hook]
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away

[Verse 3: Imani]
It's 1995
And now that I'm older, stress weighs on my shoulders
Heavy as boulders, but I told y'all
Until the day that I die I still
Will be a soldier and that's all I told ya
And that's all I showed ya
And that's all I sold ya
And all this calamity is rippin' my sanity
Can it be (that I'm a celebrity
Who's on the brink of insanity?)
Now don't be wishin' of switchin' any positions with me
Cause when you in my position, it ain't never easy
To do any type of maintainin'
Cause all this gamin' and famin' from entertainin'
Is hella strainin' (to the brain and)
But I can't keep runnin' I just gotta keep keen and cunnin'

[Hook]
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away
Can't keep running away

208,Livin' Proof,Livin' Proof,Group Home,1995-01-01,254933,50,"

[Verse 1]
[Lil' Dap]
My life story strictly business, never blew my chance
Moms kicked me out the house when I was flipping ""I'm The Man""
Put the boys on the street, make them walk this beat
Teach them how to eat, and to seek for peace
Son I stamped this name Living Proof 'cause I mean what I say
Bring the fake to reality and make them pay
Yo these ghetto rhyme stories got 'em scared to death
I'm trying to get the fuck out, see what the world's about
Check it, 1986 is when I reached my peak
Take my brothers outta state and tried to make some ends meet
First destination Texas and it's just like that
Making moves with my brothers and there's no turning back
We got thirty-six grams on the scale right now
Getting ready with my brothers time to break the shit down
I'm not about killing my people but you know how it go
Work with me not against me and we'll make mad dough
Wear my co-defendant out when I break down with rap
Hold me back and give me love and now I'm giving it back
A unique sound from the streets and it's just so sweet
My living proof life story, let me break it in peace

[Melachi the Nutcracker]
Yo, I rock on the block with the real hip-hop
As you start to clock... and jock
Yo, I'm coming off with mad rage
Eighteen, and hitting the real stage
But don't worry 'bout me, 'cause I'm making it
And if I can't have it, then I'm taking it
That's how it is, 'cause I'm living trife
Where's my knife? Take a chance with your life
Rappers decapitate, and disintegrate
You I will mutilate, when I penetrate
Go for the one when I say raid
A hitman for hire and I wanna get paid
'Cause bullets are sprayed and anybody is laid
More money is made and that's the family trade
See, I make moves and tell what's the truth
That's why I'm here, to be living proof

[Scratching 4X]
""Leave it up to me while I be living proof""
""Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough""

[Verse 2]
[Melachi the Nutcracker]
I'm lost, must pay the cost to be the boss
With force, rather get my point across
I'm going off on the mic, insane, out of sight
When I take flight (Like who, kid?) like Mike
And you see, I be rolling like a battlecat
And I'm ready to rip on my combat
Beef, I'm not having that, yo, I pull my trigger back
And all you pussy niggas know where my heart is at
I like to stay down low but yo I flip at times
Like when I'm kicking lines, or busting out nines
It's like that, should I jump off the roof
Sike, 'cause I wouldn't be living proof

""Kick the truth to the young Black youth""

[Lil' Dap]
The moral of the story—what the fuck's going on?
And our seeds won't see 2000 if these niggas keep frontin'
I used to hustle on the block, now I rock for papes
Watch as the world turn, and I will come back
Relieving stress off my brain, I got the la-la for that
Breaking down all subjects, and then all facts
Letting loose everyday, but still, keeping it fat
Bust it, niggas keep on fronting in this game, a'ight?
Scared to death ass rappers don't get no props
Scared to come to the ghetto talkin' 'bout busting shots
See, I can walk around the ghetto, stand in peace and at ease
Get my ghetto crowd open, yo, you know what I mean?
Indeed, see what I see and then you know what I mean
Getting ready for the future so don't fuck with me
My living proof life story niggas I kill it with ease...

[Scratching]
""Leave it up to me while I be living proof""
""Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough""
""Leave it up to me while I be living proof""
""Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough""
""Leave it up to me while I be living proof""
""Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough""
""Leave it up to me while I be living proof""
""To kick the truth to the young Black youth""

209,4th Chamber,Liquid Swords,GZA,1995-11-07,276967,56,"

[Intro]
Choose the sword, and you will join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother... in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
(Baby gurgling)
So... come, boy, choose life or death

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
The only man a ho wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83 rocked Tale Lords
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own phone sex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner-sittin' wine niggas sippin' Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
'Cause I be duckin' crazy spades
The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Ironman be sippin' rum out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aimin' nozzles, stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Gimme mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th
Built with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I judge wisely as if nothin' ever surprise me
Loungin' between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave 'em split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

[Verse 3: RZA]
Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scalin' your building
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic, black Hebrew
The year 2002, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads gettin' slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin' with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144,000 chosen
Protons-Electrons-Always-Cause-Explosions

[Verse 4: GZA]
The bank's a G, all CREAM downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin' to figure who invented
This unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now, watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
'Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short-fused

Rock the house (rock the house...)
East New York, East New York
East New York, East New York
Uhh, East New York, East New York
East New York, East New-York
To my nigga AZ, hit it off

[Verse 1: AZ]
We was already molded in people's minds as mulignanes
Now we more fucked, stuck with a mayor named Giuliani
You can try to blind me, analyze but can't define me
My mind's divine, heavily entwined with Gandhi's
Far from feeble, I leave your nostrils hard to breathe through
'Cause my cerebrals are more of a higher plane than the Hebrews
My mic devotion brings out my deepest emotions
Overdosin' wannabes posin', sendin' 'em through convulsions
Too hard to follow, you took a bite but couldn't swallow
Your mind's boggled
But I'm as deep as Donald Goines novels
My whole persona's kinda laid back like a recliner
And since a minor, I been fuckin' with marijuana
Wavy hair, my skin got a money-gettin' glare
Strictly menace wear, mackin' off a Guinness beer
So where it all begins is here
Destiny and me finally meet
So how can I be weak? I'm rather unique

[Refrain: Big Daddy Kane sample & Pete Rock]
Why, why, why I'm rather unique
So check it out, why I'm rather unique
So check it out, why, why, I'm rather unique
So check it out, why I'm rather, rather rather unique
So check it out, why I'm rather unique
Just check it out, why I'm, why, why I'm rather unique
So check it out, why, why, why I'm rather unique
AZ, check him out, one time, why, why, why I'm rather unique

[Verse 2: AZ]
My verbals rip shit, brains give birth to thoughts in triplets
Fuck it, I'm on some flip shit, ready to let my clip spit
Dramatical, vocals release shells like automatics do
Music's magical, causin' any battles to be tragical, child
Got a style sick as hell, sicker than sickle cell anemia
Slaughter your circulatory like leukemia
Filled with larceny, who want parts of me? I'm vicious
Mad malicious, 'cause it's real on this road to riches
I got this mastered, other rappers'll graft it, weak and wicked
Camouflagin' as killers; how they speak and kick it
Peep this uniqueness, non-believers I'm leavin' speechless
Left to choke as if skunk smoke was comin' through the speakers
Surgically nice with any verbal device
Trife, breathin' life into mics
My eyesight's beyond the twilight
So die or fight, no surrender, no retreat
Techniques speak, I'm rather unique

[Refrain: Big Daddy Kane sample & Pete Rock]
So check it out, why I'm rather unique
Uhh, why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York, why, why, I'm rather unique
Why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York, why, why, I'm rather unique
Why, why, I'm rather unique
East New York, East New York, why, why, I'm rather unique
My man AZ to the fullest

[Verse 3: AZ]
So it's gonna take more than your astrologist to knowledge this
Physiologists couldn't even figure out the exoticness
Raps demolishin', certified the way I style it
My wordplay blaze with the rays of ultraviolet
My culture's smilin', gettin' more in depth with each breath
Autobiography follows the footsteps of Malcolm X
Money and sex, Gore-Tex, Donna Karan and Guess
Finesse, success through the life stress, mics I bless
Puffin' trees to get me high as trapeze
Lookin' Japanese, at ease when I'm stackin' G's
So let's discuss, plus degrees
Why the rhyme force is the source for thoughts that's lost
So don't cross 'cause it'll cost
The ghetto savior, smooth for real, playa with flavor
Moves be major, with un-explainable behavior
The word's on the street, so keep your ears to the concrete
Why I'm rather unique

[Refrain: Big Daddy Kane & Pete Rock]
Why I'm rather unique
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out

212,Temptations,Me Against The World,2Pac,1995-03-14,300573,56,"

[Sample]
Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy

[Intro: 2Pac]
Yo, Mo Bee, mayn, drop that shit!
You know what time
Boo-yaow! I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand, you know what I'm sayin'?
And uh, throw up that finger!
Hey yo, throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style, baby, thug style, y'know?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Tell me, baby, are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if you're only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong, love, tell me, 'cause I get caught up
In the life I live, it's hell, see, I never thought
I'd see the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard?
I've been known to clown and get around, that's my word
See you walkin' and you lookin' good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
With your attitude to match, right? Don't be phony
Cause I hate it when you act like, you don't know me
I've been stressin' in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go—

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go
Throw them the finger!
You know what, baby, it's like—

[Chorus: Easy Mo Bee]
I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Will I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people callin', I'm passin' by
Everybody knows I'm ballin', and to God
Gotta keep myself from fallin', but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do?
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while? You decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was—

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go, throw your fingers up!
That's just the thug in me, girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like—

[Chorus: Easy Mo Bee]
I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
A lot of people think it's easy to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was—

[Outro: 2Pac]
Give 'em the finger, and all my homies go
Yo, this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey, y'know?
Throw your fingers up!
You know? They gonna peep this
This how we run game on you
All my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger!
Throw your hands up, give 'em the finger!

213,Hey Lover,Mr. Smith (Deluxe Edition),LL Cool J,1995-11-20,284693,58,"

[Intro: Michael McCary]
I've been watchin' you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man can need
And ever ask for
This is love, girl
This is more than a crush
Yeah

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
It was Harlem at the Ruckers, I saw with your man
Smilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So skated off, as you strolled off
Lookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (So fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew him five months (That's right)
Besides, he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
And I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years
Hey lover

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still, he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin' into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love, we both fell
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss
Undyin' passion unities our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control, but
It's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm a keep all these feelin's inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than...
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, baby this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

Ready to get 'em up with-a me thugs
And to cash that dum, man, I gotta get paid

Hittin' that reefer hydro, you know the cut so fuck them po-po

[Recording Info]

[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

[Chorus: LV]
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know

[Refrain: LV]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

[Chorus: LV]
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin'; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

[Chorus: LV]
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Refrain: LV]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

[Part 1]

[Intro]
We'd be bigger than the Jews, bigger than the Irish
You can run the whole fucking country!
You could be the next John D. Rockerfeller
Nobody noticed us, nobody gave a shit
But the bigger we get
The more we're taking from other people

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, in a mahogany, black scenery
That was lightnin' and rain drops
I'm tied up in a basement cocaine spot like Bangkok
I'm blindfold, Vietnam type mind control, this torture
His accent sounds like the rarest culture
Askin' me, my atrophy stabbin' me gradually
Says his attribute was satanic, masonic, ironic
I felt reminded of my fast life ventures and winters
Blinded 'til the flashlight enters

[Verse 2: AZ]
Yo, dunn, before the sun set, call connect, get all the TECs
I'm vexed, this nigga stalled for sex, lost respect, let's off his neck
My caliber got me thinkin' on a higher algebra
See, me, I'm just as foul as ya, but you ain't got no style in ya
I'm into bigger cheddar, G's and better, Armarett-ah's
Armani sweaters, plus these crabs could never dead us

[Chorus x2: AZ]
Mo' money, mo' murder, mo' homicide
You catch that body, nigga, better have that alibi
You never know, it might just be yo' time, you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, watch that suicide

[Verse 3: AZ]
Now, government official got you sippin' Cristal in crystal
You fish, you foul, so you fell and took your fam wit' you
I'm out to get you, guaranteed every shell will hit you
Plus I'm on some shit too, layin' down whosoever witchu
Mafiosa, the New York City 90's era Sosa
AZ, you know my culture, now my wolves is out to ghost ya

[Verse 4: Nas]
Scent of a rose on a graveyard, for real now
The stakes is up a half a mill now
I tried to grab him with his shield down
Four walked in, they're crazy paid up, sharp but straight up
Gators from Barbados, never seen nobody play those
Lay-Low's what they called him, his head baldin'
Sippin' cappuccino, spilled on his silk suits, was scaldin'
Laugh was vulgar, canvas paintings of the Ayatollah
And on his arm, he wore a priceless vulture
Tobacco pipe smoker; Escobar, your life is over
Justify the righteous nova, bullets flew out his right shoulder
Corpse leavin' a foul odor
The Firm Vol. 1 adjourned, bring it to a closure

[Chorus: AZ]
Mo' money, mo' murder, mo' homicide
You catch that body, nigga, better have that alibi
You never know, it might just be yo' time you, take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, now watch that suicide

[Verse 5: Nas]
So now ya rollin' with us like co-defendants, no phony business
So know the difference
From supreme soloists, it's styles ancient as Moses scriptures
It's Latin Kings, Black Kufis and White Justice amongst us
Crime invades the minds of youngsters
Where it's pitch-black, they can't see you
Godfather III, four left for dead, in a cathedral

[Verse 6: AZ]
Now you're forced to listen
I got the mind of a grad' from Princeton
Play your position, or soon you'll be lost and missin'
It's far from fiction, my presence is like that of a Christian
With ammunition, puttin' states under submission
Street addiction got me tied in thorough with boroughs
Still in the ghetto, but in the cut where it's mellow
Incognito, on the lee-low like Carlito
‘Cause we know, niggas don't really want us to see doe
You never know, it might just be yo' time, you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, watch that suicide

[Chorus x4: AZ]
Mo' money, mo' murder, mo' homicide
You catch that body, nigga, better have that alibi
You never know, it might just be yo' time, you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, (now) watch that suicide

[Outro: Nas]
Homicide, mo' homicide
Mo' suicide, mo' homicide

[Part 2]

[Intro]
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…

[Verse: AZ]
All alone in this wilderness, who could figure life as ill as this?
My vision's blurred from guerillas mist
Gun sprays, strays left a portion of my crew in graves
Niggas that would screw in ways unknown to these dudes today
Intelligence kept us all away from state evidence
‘Cause it's evident, this world is controlled on dead presidents
Never hesitant, I'm soulless, filled with coldness
Born to uphold this 'til I'm left dead from oldness

[Outro]
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…
Born alone, die alone…

[Intro: Mack 10 & Ice Cube]
Mack 10 you know you rule hip-hop and
Ice Cube you know you rule hip-hop and
Mack 10 you know you rule hip-hop and
Wait a minute, that ain't how the West Coast rock, nigga!

[Verse 1]
Mack 10, nutty as they come leave 'em face down
And numb from the waist down
It's a Sunday a gun day
Rollin' down a one way
In my 'lac front and back
Over train tracks
On yak and herb nigga swerve
It get's on my nerves, banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane
I'm butta man
Foot to the flo'
What you want from the sto'
I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
Comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
But niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'mma vet you can bet
That I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
Everybody run when I bust a cap
Puttin' Inglewood up on the map
Look at what I do when I pulls my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown
Bitch hit the silent alarm it's goin' down

[Hook]
Foe life, foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes
Foe life, foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes

[Verse 2]
Khaki suit ski mask is my attire
With my luck cut my chucks on the barbed wire
Fool where ya keep the rims and tires
'fo yo' life expires, I'm as nutty as Michael Myers
Didn't think about the Rottweiler
A lot of stiches in the ass, blood in the Impala
Sittin' in the County with a gold record
Ice Cube send me pictures of bitches naked
Caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand, your Honor I'mma changed man
So please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go? and if he say no
I'mma have to say bitch get out the car slow and leave ya fuckin' dough
Cause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world
Let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

[Chorus]
Foe life, foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes
Foe life, foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes

[Verse 3]
Call 911 there's a son of a bitch on the roof
Yarned up in his birthday suit
(Mack 10 to the rescue)
My momma wanna know why I do what I do
Cause I'm superman superbad supermad superfly
Fool you can die
There's gonna be a lot of cars with they lights on
And I'm at home sewing stripes on
Cause I'm the General and you's a stowaway
'bout to buck you down with this throw away
With no serial number it's the summer
Where niggas die, it's hotter than July
You better stay low fo' you get a halo
Plus wings and a gown when I come around
So take 10 paces
And try to guess the color of my shoelaces

[Hook]
Foe life, foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes
Foe life, foe life
Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes

218,Duel Of The Iron Mic,Liquid Swords,GZA,1995-11-07,246226,52,"

[Intro]
Oh, mad one, we see your trap
You can never escape your fate
Submit with honor to a duel with my son
I agree

I see you're using an old style
I wondered where you'd learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?
And what have you come for?
You come here, since you're so interested - fight me

[Verse 1: GZA]
Yo, picture bloodbaths in elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow-moving MCs is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions, facial expression
Leaves impression, try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts, son, here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th, from Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grow on trees and there's thieving MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast
Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
This is not a '85 affair made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killer Beez are stinging something while I reveal
Science that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testing the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the Hip Hop livestock
Seeking for a serum to cure 'em

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, keys in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing

[Hook]
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

[Outro]
Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost
Their techniques vanished

[Intro]
Child: Why you by the window? What's wrong daddy?
Mother: I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker
He just stand by the goddamn window
With that fuckin' AK all day (there you go)
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't eat
You don't even do a goddamn thing

[Verse 1]
I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the - corner, any day
Tryin to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I'm thinkin' 'bout my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? - Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of indo and my mind can't take the stress, I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self; but I see death around the corner

[Hook]
(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")
I see death around the corner
(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")

[Verse 2]
I see death around the corner, the pressure's gettin' to me
I no longer trust my homies - them phonies tried to do me
Smokin' too much weed, got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest, under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived, straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas that was buggin'
My homie told me once, don't you trust them other suckers
They front like they your homies but they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who'd care
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
Got homies in my head that done passed away screamin' ""Please!""
Young nigga, make G's
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless, I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner

[Hook]
(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")
I see death around the corner
(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")

[Verse 3]
(I was raised) I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kiddy
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household
And drinkin' liquor til' you out cold
And though I'm grown now, nigga it's still on - Pow!
Bustin on them niggas 'til they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta be suspicious when I bone
Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless, them bitches'll start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murder me now but see me later man, that's on my pops
I got homies that will hunt you 'til you drop
I hope the Lord can forgive me
I was a G and gettin' high was a way of bein' free
I see death around the corner

[Hook]
(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")
I see death around the corner
(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")

[Outro]
This is for all the real motherfuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die; we all gotta go, y'know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
(You think you're gonna live long enough to spend that money
You fuckin hump?)
Y'all niggas stop actin' like pussies out there, all right
If any of you..
Are tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like that...
I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night I wanna piss on his ashes!
I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night I wanna piss on his ashes!
I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead!
I want him dead, I don't care...

Just blink yourself away?
Just think, what if you could just

Jeff X can rock the mic with tooth decay
I be the 5 foot 7
Residin' at the Mecca rest address in South section
Used to cut class in the infinite pursuit of ass back in '86
Easy with the chicks, I was a chocolate boy
Raised in the cellar with the rhythm like Ella
Walked the mega-trife streets to the subway where I lay
'Til the train stopped, then a nigga hopped (Hopped)
Used to do the pop dance to the Planet Rock
At the block party, everybody jocked, ""Who, me?!""
It's the MC sucka niggas envy

I can make you feel that I'm a surreal cartoon
With my pistol in the face of Hip-Hop, stickin' for papes
Because I'm on a paper chase (Say what?) I'm on a paper chase
My Timberlands are fully laced, I be the Mr. Boogeyman
With records from 125th to Japan
I let 'em play like Donny Hathaway and shake a hand, shake a hand
Your lady tried to kick it, but I couldn't play my man

Johnny on the spot, got the rhythm and the rhyme
Fuckin' with The Roots, you know them niggas is a dime
I can make a 100-yard line start to dash
I can make a whole lake of fish start to splash
I can make Conan and The Titans clash
And I could make Metallica and Guns N' Roses thrash
Used to smash, crash parties like I was disturbed
Used to make plots against the herringbone herb
But now, all I do—disperse the verb
And like a nerd, I can make you say ""He's superb!""
Worded perfect, never ever shall you misinterpret
I move styles like bowels, so now you know I'm worth it
Direct from Philly, the land where niggas scheme
So you know I got that sheen in my gleam

[Chorus: Black Thought]
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)

The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Champagne wishes and caviar dreams, a team that's gettin' cream
With sales of fishscales from triple beams
I gleam, livin' the life of Riley, packin' fifty calis
Rockin' lizard Bally's while we do a drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos, just me and my dino primo
Pushin' beam-o's, then parlay in Reno with two fly Latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count math from steam baths
We've seen Half-a-Milli Jackson out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin' papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used as shootin' targets soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us, try to beat us, we got hookers with heaters
That'll straight pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
The leaders lookin' straight charmin' in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas?
You gots to come get through our whole army
The cee-lo rollers, money folders, sippin' Bolla, holdin' mad payola
Slangin' that Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks, but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game, we do our thing, son

[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
Livin' the fast life, with fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from outta Queens with the American Dream
So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven-figure cream
Livin' the fast life, with fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from outta Queens with the American Dream
So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven-figure cream

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
Mid-state and Green, it seems, is where all my niggas be
The ghetto misery; shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular angle of the clout war
Police searchin' up my Lexo, but who's petro?
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect, though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin' with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years, I got they names in my swears
Poppin' Cristal like it's my first child, lickin' shots Holiday style
Rockin' Steele sweaters, Wallabee down
Twenty-four carats, countin' cabbage like the Arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin' Guinness, shootin', catchin' cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G — ghetto wise guys
The Luciano, Frankie Yale, Bugsy Siegel
Green papers with eagles from a trade that's illegal

[Chorus x2]
Brother, you've got to make it happen
Yeahhhahh yeahhh, get this money, yeahhh
Brother, you've got to make it happen
When you're livin' in the fast life, heyy, yeaaaah, yeah

[Verse 3: G Rap & Nas]
A-yo, our lifestyles' exquisite, yayo like a blizzard
Esquire attire, standin' on ground with one pivot
Two players rockin' silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
Lands with name-brand seats, reclinin' like it's spacious
Bodies on ice, livin' trife, rollin' fixed up dice
Gamblin' Grants, handlin' stamps, moves are sheist
My bankrolls got the cops comin' in plain clothes
Tryin' to arraign our gang 'cause of our fame
That's how the game goes (True)
Right out the slammer with the fame and glamour
Cookin' up grams with Arm & Hammer
Supplyin' scramblers in Alabama
Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin' us Dom, Veuve Clicquot
Dimes look magnifico, puttin' a cut inside perico
Heat for foes, shoppin' sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Caribbean suites deep, rippin' beats with flows
A-yo, we went from standin' on blocks without some socks
Sellin' rocks, to pickin' up stocks in boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin' all the blue steel, we keeps it real inside the battlefield
Yeah, so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings

[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
Livin' the fast life, with fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are

(Yeah, bust it, yo, yo) Fly G.I. niggas

[Chorus]
Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real, though, let's connect, politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces

[Verse 1]
Thug-related style attract millions, fans
They understand my plan, who's the kid up in the green Land?
Me and the RZA connect, blow a fuse, you lose
Half-ass crews get demolished and bruised
Fake be fronting, hourglass-heads niggas be wanting
Shutting down your slot, time for pumping
Poisonous sting, which thumps up and act chumps
Rae's a heavy generator, but yo, guess who's the black Trump?
Dough be flowing by the hours, Wu, we got the collars
Scholars, word life, peace to Power and my whole unit
Word up, quick to set it, don't wet it
Real niggas lick shots, peace Connecticut

[Chorus]
Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real, though, let's connect, politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces

[Verse 2]
Chef'll shine like marble, rhyme remarkable
Real niggas raise up, spend your money, argue
But this time is for the uninvited
Go 'head and rhyme to it, bitch nigga, mics is getting fired
More fiends, chicks be burning like chlorine
Niggas recognize from here to Baltimore to Fort Greene
But hold up, Moët be tasting like throw-up
My mob roll up, dripped to death, whips rolled up
You never had no wins, sliding in these dens
With Timbs, with MAC-10's and broke friends
You got guns? Got guns too, what up, son?
Do you wanna battle for cash and see who sons who?
I'll probably wax tracks, smack rap niggas, you, facts
Niggas' lyrics are wack, nigga
Can't stand unofficial, wet tissue, blank busting Scud missiles
You rolling like Trump, you get your meat lumped
For real, it's just slang rap democracy
Here's the policy, slide off the ring, plus the Wallabees
Check the status, soon to see me at, Caesar's Palace eating salads
We beating mics sending keys to Dallas
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
From staircase to stage, minimum wage
But soon to get a article in Rap Page
But all I need is my house, my gat, my Ac'
Bank account fat, it's going down like that
And pardon the French, but let me speak Italian
Black stallions wildling on Shaolin
That means the island of Staten
And niggas carry gats and mad police from Manhattan

[Chorus]
Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real though, let's connect, politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces

[Verse 3]
I do this for barber shop niggas in the Plaza
Catching asthma, Rae is sticking gun-flashers
Well-dressed, skating through the projects with big ones
Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one upstairs
Switch like a chameleon, hit Brazilians
Pass the cash or leave your children, leave the building
Niggas, yo, they be folding like envelopes
Under pressure, like Lou Ferrigno on coke
Yo, Africans denying niggas up in yellow cabs
Musty like fuck, waving they arms to Arabs
Sit back, cooling like Kahlúas on rocks
On the crack spots, rubber band wrap all my knots
View bitches who fuck dreads on Sudafeds
Pussy's hurting, they did it for a yard for the feds
Word up, cousin, nigga, I seen it
Like a 27-inch Zenith, believe it

[Chorus]
Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real, though, let's connect, politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces

[Outro]
Yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real, though, let's connect, politic, ditto
Get lifted in the staircases
Peace, incarcerated scarfaces
Time is runnin' out
Politic, ditto
Incarcerated scarfaces

[Intro: RZA & GZA]
Yo yeah, check it out, son, check it out, son
Yo Wu, can I get a soo?, live in the place to be
You got the capital G, Z to the A, MC
Givin' a mad shout out to the Ranch Crew, from the old school
And we gonna take y'all back, know what I'm sayin'?
Lyrical sorcerers right here, the fathers, the cream of the crop, son
Yo, check it

[Hook: GZA & RZA, Method Man]
Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well, ok
Well, if you like the way it sound, then clap, man
And if the women love it too, well, then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it

[Verse 1: GZA]
My rhyme gross weight vehicle combination
Was too heavy for the Chevy's, is chased out the station
Double-edged was the guillotine that beheaded it
Gassed up, fuckin' with some regular unleaded shit
Heads roll on hillsides behind ropes that bind-in
X marks the spot on the scope
Heavily armed, military is necessary, it's a gamble
MCs bet they best at every
Powerful parable ditties might harm
If tampered with, set off and strike like pipe bombs
Flashbacks to the ""Duel of the Iron Mic""
Look out for these fatal flying spikes, so massive
Sleep-holds, put strangle on commercial angle
Microphone cords tangled from being Star Spangled
Now, who could ever say they heard of this?
My motherfuckin' style is mad murderous

[Hook: GZA & Method Man]
Well, if you like the way it sound then clap man (clap man)
And if the bitches love it too well then raise your hands (Come on)
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, yeah
Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front we don't have them (Have them)
So we blast 'em, (Blaow!) alright, well okay

[Pre-Verse: Method Man, GZA]
Well, what you know about MCin'?
Yo, I know a lot
Well, can you demonstrate somethin', nigga?
Huh, I'd rather not
I'm talkin 'bout stacks, cousin
Nigga, that's what I got
Cash Rules the world
Well, Cash Rules the spot

[Verse 2: GZA]
My preliminary attack keep cemeteries packed
Of niggas who think it ain't like that
MCs are gunned down like being run down with mad trucks
Then, God struck, religious niggas call it ""bad luck""
Rap celeb, you got caught up in the web
Now, bees are stingin', yo, that niggas em-singin'
I'm just swingin' swords strictly based on keyboards
Unbalanced like elephants and ants on see-saws
I throw raps that attack like the Japs on Pearl Harbor
MCs be out like bank robbers
Fleeing the scene, to be a sole survivor
DJ, the getaway driver
Tried to dip, but he dive, I socialize on vocal vibes
On tracks stabbed up with razor-sharp knives
Criminal subliminal minded rappers find it
Hard to define it, when narrow is the gate
For fat tapes and then played out and out of date
Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate
And from that point, the God made a statement
Draftin' tracements, replacements in basements
Materials in sheet-rock to sound proof the beatbox
And microscopic optics received through the boxes
Obnoxious topic, major labels, flavor tropical
Punchlines, that's unstoppable
Ring like shots from Glocks that attract cops
Around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop
But we only increase if everything is peace
Father You See King the police

[Hook: GZA, Method Man, GZA & RZA]
Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em (Have them)
So we blast 'em (blaow), alright, well, ok
Well, if you like the way it sounds, then clap, man (Clap, man)
And if the women love it too, well, then raise your hands (Uh huh, come on)
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it
Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em (Have them)
So we blast 'em, alright, well, ok

[Outro: GZA]
The Wu-Tang say
We don't handle 'em, alright, well okay
The world today, the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front we don't handle 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well ok

[Skit: Gibran Evans]
When I was little, my father was famous
He was the greatest samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of 131 lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
That was the night everything changed

[Intro: RZA]
See, sometimes
You gotta flash 'em back
See, niggas don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm sayin', we gonna take y'all back to the source
Do the knowledge, yo

[Chorus: RZA + GZA]
When the MCs came to live out the name
And to perform, some had
To snort cocaine, to act insane
Before Pete Rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane, to spark the brain
With the building to be born
Yo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut

[Verse 1: GZA]
Fake niggas get flipped in mic fights
I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite, you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene
Like a syringe, on some wild out shit to insert a fiend
But it was your op. to shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin' smart
I put mad pressure on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts
That's minimum and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-phones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga, I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
'Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Through clouds of smoke of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance, that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my Clan in Da Front want it

[Chorus]
Now, when the MCs came to live out the name
And to perform, some had
To snort cocaine, to act insane
Before Pete Rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain
With the building to be born
Yo, the RZA flip the track with the what to cut

[Verse 2: GZA]
I'm on a Mission that niggas say is Impossible
But when I swing my swords, they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
'Cause niggas' styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
'Round the clock, that state pen time, check it
But the pens I be stickin' with, you can't state the crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep, it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

[Chorus]
When the MCs came to live out the name
And to perform, some had
To snort cocaine, to act insane
Before Pete Rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane, to spark the brain
With the building to be born
Yo, RZA flip the track with the what to cut

226,Ambitionz Az A Ridah,All Eyez On Me,2Pac,1996,278386,69,"

[Intro]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

[Verse 2]
It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
(That's all you niggas got?)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me (Yo)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill]
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake (Yeah)
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their four hundred-pound mate
If I could rule the world (If I ruled the world), everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto. of course, when giddy-upping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me (Yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Gore-Tex and sweats, I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo, I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies (Ha)
So while you imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away from these scars I got, oh, baby
Hey, baby, ‘cause I got a lot, oh, yeah
And anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know, oh, baby
Hey, baby, you can't hide from the block, oh, no

[Verse 3: Pras, Pras & Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber (Drop bombs)
Crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die (He's super fly)
Toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes, sir)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (Ayo, nobody move)
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide (Ayo, nobody move)
Gonna find you and make you want me (Come on)
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (You know the—)
Gonna find you and take it slowly (You know)
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide

228,If I Ruled the World (Imagine That) (feat. Lauryn Hill),It Was Written,Nas,1996-07-02,282373,68,"

[Produced by Rashad Smith & Trackmasters]

[Intro: Nas]
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse 3: Nas]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felony
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons,I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em, love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons
Black diamonds, I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em, love 'em baby!

229,Bow Down,The Best Of Westside Connection,Westside Connection,2007-11-30,207840,54,"

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
The world is mine, nigga, get back
Don't fuck with my stack the gauge is racked
About to drop the bomb I'm the motherfuckin' don
Big fish in a small pond
Now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath. They want to miss me when I'm tipsy
Running everything west of the Mississippi
Its the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
We got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call
Got 25 niggas running up on y'all
For the cheese we want them keys
Everybody freeze on your knees, butt naked please
Before any of you guppies get heart
Nigga! Rewind my part fool and....(Bow Down)

[Chorus: Ice Cube]
(Bow down) When I come to your town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you (Ooh!)

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
I take ten steps and I draw (Blaow!)
Now who's dissin' the mad-ass Inglewood addition
I bust like a pimple, my mind is elemental
The Westside connects with me and South Central
And a drag from the Zig Zag can't fuck with the Phillys
Holdin' down the wild west like a kid they call Billy
Once again it's Mack 10 the gold crown holda
Strong as a Coca-Cola with a chrome pistola (Brr!)
Now who wanna fuss so I can buss when I cuss
My look bring you fear with gear from the Surplus
Since a teen, I chased the green, the crack-scene king
Lolos, Corniches and baguettes on my pieces (Ugh)
So recognize these real Gs, chase the cheese
The Westside Connec' keep it rolling like gold D's
Three-wheeling and dealing, it's like the California style
But in the meanwhile, in my town, you got to bow

[Chorus: MACK 10]
(Bow down) When you come to my town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Because I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

[Verse 3: W.C.]
Well it's that, Chuck-wearing, still sporting the beanie
The shadiest nigga in the clique, who want to see me?
As I slide my Locs on, let my khakis hang
Westside Connec' gang, Connec' gang, bing-bing bang (Westside!)
Run away, run away, or get your punk ass slayed
By this H double O to the D to the S.T.A. (Ahh!)
Fuck hiding it, I'm gang-related, simple and plain
Which means I could give a fuck
About you niggas in this rap game (Ugh!)
Flashy niggas get stuck up (Ugh!), beat the fuck up (Ugh!)
When you come around, keep your chain tucked from this...
Zero-zero-apostrophe S shit
Fuck a studio lyricist, I'm real with this (Yes!)
Talk the talk walk the walk
Diss me on wax?
I'm trying to saw your whole fucking head off, nigga
I'm platinum bound, so bitch, shut up
And nigga, all y'all could kiss my Converse like Sho Nuff

[Chorus: WC]
(Bow down) When I come to your town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

[Chorus: All]
(Bow down) When you come to our town
(Bow down) When we westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz we ain't no haters like you
Bow down to some niggas that's greater than you

[Outro: Ice Cube]
Yeah
Ha
Let me tell you something
Gangsta's make the world go round
So you ain't got to clown
But if you live on the west side of your town
Make them other fools bow down
Westside Connection
The world belongs to us

[Interlude: All]
Bow down
Bow down
Bow down

[Chorus: All]
(Bow down) When you come to our town
(Bow down) When we westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz we ain't no haters like you
Bow down to some niggas that's greater than you (Fool)

[Hook]
(Get on down)
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up
(Get on down)
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up
If you find a bag of weed on the floor motherfucker
What the fuck you gon' do?
(Get on down)
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up
(Get on down)
Pick it up, pick it up

[Verse 1: Redman]
While I crack a cold Beck's and keep the hoes in check
The double-S vest nigga wreck the discotheque
Sit back relax and while my Squad kick tacks
Then tap your man back and be like ""Did you see that??""
Ahh yes, comin from the North South East West
Hold your nose and take a deep breath, recess
We bless, mics, three times a day
Three times a night, it all equals subliminal sequels
Strictly laughing at MC's
Lyrics for years that run more than ten deep
Niggas be like ""Ahh he changed his style up""
Shut the fuck up, ya still a dick-ridah
It's '96 so get wit' it
Keep that back-in-the-day shit when that other Squad was Hit-tin
Listen, must we forget, I originated
All that wild shit, that rrraahh rrraaoowww shit
That jump up and ready to fuck shit up now shit
Brick City!! Is where I get down kid
Peace to all my buddah smokers on Prince
Fuck what ya heard, Brick City runs shit

[Hook]
(Get on down)
P.P.P. got the Glocks and tecs
And Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck
(Get on down)
Say what? Got some fly shit on deck
(Get on down)
Say WHAT? Got some fly shit on deck
P.P.P. got the Glocks and tecs
And Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck
(Get down)

[Verse 2: Redman]
First of all, MC's be on my balls, straight up
Pubic hairs and everything, lick the whole plate up
Bay Area, roll up your Las Vegas
To all MC's, I love it that you hate us
Drop skills that might send wind chill factors
Back through Patterson, J.C
And Hacken-sack
Step uncorrect and get blackened
The assassin, find da MC's by the jazz men
I don't tote guns I tote funds
While you still puzzled how my antidote runs
Your whole vocabulary's played out, admit it
Still wack if it came out my mouth and I spit it (Get on down)
You remind me of school on a Sunday
No class, beatin all King's down
Doin over seventy, in a Hyundai, blast
Give em a good reason to open Alcatraz back
Nobody got the Red shook
Been a weirdo ever since the doctor said PUSH
Def Squad skills make it hard to overlook me
That's why the hardcore promoters still book me
You shook G... word up... hah hah...

[Hook]
(Get on down)
If you see a bag of weed on the floor motherfucker
What the fuck you gon do
Pick it up, pick it up
(Get on down)
If you see a bitch passed out on the fuckin' ground
What the fuck you gon do
Pick her up, pick her up
(Get on down)
I keep it fly y'all
Fly fly y'all (5X)
(Get on down)

[Verse 3: Redman]
Aiyyo, don't ride the dick of these real MC's
We pull Joints like Spike and blow crews to degrees
Then we buy G's with a half a pound of dope MC's
We bag for cheese just to get weed
Smoke indoneez I'm milky like Magnese
Oh-seven-one-oh-three, rest them car thieves
Guzzlin quart for sports of all sorts
Nonchalant spark buddah on the front porch
At courts, F-U-N-K-D-O-C
S-P-O-T, feel the Solo type remedy
Then freeze.... (Get on down) hah, ha-hah
Where was I? Oh yes
Sippin on Cristal with fingers up your bitch dress
Don't play close cause jealousy make folks act loc
Another nigga smoked from impression
Second guessin my verbal weapon, you're lettin
Spit, sixteen bits, come equipped
And I still walk around with the hooked up
Motorola flip on my hip, fuck the government
Drop shit, it's a microscopic topic
How I stay mo' bent than McDonald arches
And uptown got the la-la spots
And bad ass hoes with 54-11 Reeboks
But still, I walk around with the grill
Cause niggas be blinded by this hip-hop shit for real
I ain't havin that, I'm clappin shit
Fuck this rappin shit, I cause accidents
To any, MC who wonder what got in me
To get busy, it's simply Ginger and Remi
It don't stop, Def Squad crew is hot
Fillin up your brain with supreme octane, and it's on

231,Hell on Earth (Front Lines),Hell On Earth,Mobb Deep,1996-11-19,274093,63,"

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, the saga begins, begin war
I draw first, Blood, be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws
We takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors
Here come the D's, time to make breeze and gun toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
My 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts 'fore niggas pop shit
Yo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic?
Nine pound we rocked in '96, strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
With no time for patient or complication
Let's get it done right, my clique airtight
Trapped in a never-ending gunfight
So niggas lose stripes or lose life
Jail niggas sendin' kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked
Finish 'em off, well-done meat
Then send 22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

[Chorus]
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
Yo, it's right in front of your eyes

[Verse 2: Havoc]
We rep the QBC, nigga rep yours, it's all love
Milli stacked down, heavily guarded by hollow-tip slug
Then crack down on wannabe thugs
Adapt to gat sound and bow down
Slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce 20 years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
‘Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa-hatin' me
All that bullshit is just makin' me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin' cheddar
If shorty set you up you better dead her
I told you, shape and mold you, son you then I hold you
Like a pimp, mind-control you, double-edge blow you
It'll be I like I'm supposed to
The clique is coastal, international, you local
Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, son, I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like around the way cops the average pitstop
QB City Godfather Pt III
Gotti, Gambino and Ty Nitty, Scarface, rest in peace!

[Chorus]
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
Ayo, it's right in front of your eyes
Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
Ayo, it's right in front of your eyes

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
You see eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights, switch to darkness
It's deep in the abyss of street life
Blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
POW niggas is found MIA
We move like special forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in '89 the same way
The God P walk with a limp see
But simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me, you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it's full for so long ‘cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what Black, here's the issue
It's a package deal: you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap—I'm tryna make cream and that's that
Whatever it takes, however, it gots to go down
Four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless
Blow-for-blow, let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself, see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit
Or forget the essence from which I emerged
P is sick so save that bullshit for the birds
Live up to my word, if I got beef niggas comin' in herds
We flush through, your clique get purged

232,Guess Who's Back,The 18th Letter / The Book Of Life,Rakim,1996-11-04,250906,57,"

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
""Once again, back is the incredible""

[Verse 1]
It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist
Smashin' hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizzazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make 'em clap to this
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up, and play it loud
Hip-hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dancefloors just stop, the spot's scorchin' hot
Hopin' I'll open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar, smokin' ten dollar cigars
While I admire MIDI, with more vision than TVs
I find it easy catchin' diabetes from fly sweeties
Sit back and wait to hear a slammin' track
Rockin' jams, by popular demand I'm back

[Hook]
I control the crowd, you know Ra hold it down
When it drop, you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world-renowned
And I rock New York City all year around

[Verse 2]
It's on, so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs
Equations are drawn up in paisley form
Mic, it stay warm, my flow is Evian
Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra's style
From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal
Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
Split the mic open, fill it with somethin' potent to go in
And take a toke then mental planes start floatin'
Hot science is smokin', altitudes cause chokin'
Product is hypnotic, you're soakin' and still smokin'
Showin' better scenes than grams of amphetamines
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend
Long as the mic is loud and the volume's pumpin'
I'mma move crowds to two-thousand and somethin'

[Hook]
I control the crowd, you know Ra hold it down
When it drop, you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world-renowned
And I rock New York City all year around

[Verse 3]
My rhymes and lyrics find spirits like a seance
Since fat crayons, I write and display chaos
My plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam is
I take advantage until the crowd go bananas
What a rush! I hear cuts, then I lust to touch
Microphones get clutched by the illustrious
Word spread, I inherited many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
In time, no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
To find, you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
Astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges
With knowledge of scholarships, when Ra be droppin' this
Some of the things that I know will be in your next bible
When I die, go bury me and my notebook in Cairo
With the great God from Egypt, manifest, was writin' rhymes
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic

[Hook]
I control the crowd, you know Ra hold it down
When it drop, you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world-renowned
And I rock New York City all year around

I control the crowd, you know Ra hold it down
When it drop, you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound
From town to town, until it's world-renowned
And I rock New York City all year around

[Outro]
Once again, back is the incredible
Word up, Rakim Allah the Microphone Fiend is back
Yaknahmean? (Rakim Allah!)
Til' death do us part, it's on
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)
Once again, back is the incredible (Rakim Allah!)
Once again back is the incredible
The incredible, the incredible, the incredible
Once again, back is the incredible
Rhyme animal, the incredible

233,2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted (ft. Snoop Doggy Dog),All Eyez On Me,2Pac,1996,246533,51,"

[Intro: 2Pac & Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Up out of there
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin' like that?
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

[Verse 2: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

[Verse 4: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

[Verse 5: 2Pac]
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how can they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & 2Pac]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

[Verse 6: 2Pac]
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee
These niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

[Verse 7: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
It's like, Cuh, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have paper in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turn gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kid

[Verse 8: 2Pac]
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers and so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga, Dogg, and me, eternally the most wanted

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & 2Pac]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

[Outro: 2Pac]
Bitch! Where you at? Where you at?
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Yeah, Death Row

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
We used to be number 10, now we're permanent at one
In the battle lost my finger, mic became my arm
Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy, nah squeeze the Charmin
Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born, Jean
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken George become Dead George
Stealin' chickens from my farm
Damn, another dead pigeon
If you're mafiosos then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was tongue-kissin' a razor blade
That sounds sick, maybe one day I'll write a horror
Blackula comes to the ghetto (Stick 'em up), jacks an Acura
Stevie Wonder sees crack babies
Becomin' enemies of their own families

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Armageddon come, you know-a we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
Yeah, in saloons we drink Boone's and battle goons 'til high noon
Bust rap tunes on flat spoons, take no shorts like poom poom's
See hoochies pop coochies for Gucci's and loochies
Find me in my Mitsubishi, eatin' sushi, bumpin' Fugees
Hey, hey, hey, try to take the crew and we don't play play
Say, say, say, like Paul McCartney, not hardly
Oddly enough, I can see right through your bluff
Niggas huff and they puff but they can't handle us, we bust
'Cause we fortified, I could never hide
Seen ""Cooley High"", cried when Cochise died
I'm twisted, blacklisted by some other negroes
Don't remove my Polos on the first episode
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you shouldn't diss refugees, and
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you whole sound set booty, and
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you have to respect Jersey
'Cause I'm superfly when I'm super-high
On the Fu-Gee-La

Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thang

I sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees
Smokin' Beedi as I burn my calories
Brooklyn roof tops become Brooklyn tee-pees
Who that be? Enemy, wanna see the death of me
From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like
Buju Banton, I'm a true champion, like
Farrakhan reads his daily Qur'an
It's a phenomenon, lyrics fast like Ramadan

What's goin' on? Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, yo
Lost generation, fast-paced nation
World population confront they frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money-makin'
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man? Then stand your own
To emcee require skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin' and roam like a cellular phone
Far from home, givin' crowds what they wantin'
Official hip-hop consumption, The Fifth thumpin'
Keepin' your party jumpin' with an original somethin'
Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said, ""Yo, we thought we heard you""
Joke's on you; you heard a bitin'-ass crew, but, um

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothin' sacred
Aiyo, it's funny what I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine-to-five is just to hit ya, get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme-sayin', rent-payin' life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me from doin' tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds that's in the stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music runnin' through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Livin' the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick, they hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission, welcomin' to the dark
When I first spark the art's when the listenin' start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelph-i
My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealth-y
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short, ""I want it made"" like Ed, 'nuff said
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred
And discover, my level is that of no other

[Produced by Trackmasters]

[Verse 1]
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

[Refrain]
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

[Verse 2]
I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw
But, uh—a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers (Word up)

[Refrain 2]
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
There ain't an army that could strike back

[Outro: Nas & (AZ)]
Thug niggas, yo, to them thug niggas
Gettin' it on in the world, you know?
To them niggas that's locked down
Doin' they thing, survivin', ya know'm sayin'?
To my thorough niggas, New York and worldwide
Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia
9-6 shit, The Firm clique
Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin'
Y'all fake niggas, tryin' to copy
Better come with the real though, fake-ass niggas, yo
(They throw us slugs, we throwin' them back, what)
Bring the shit, man! Live, man!
(Fuck that son, word up) 9-6 shit

[Verse 1: Redman]
Aiyyo, I got a slight problem I smoke weed too much
Knees buckle the -uck up when I'm splittin my dutch
Back up back up! Ain't nobody hittin for free

It cost twenty if you're down with it
Aiyyo son I ride around with my hooptie tinted
To ride around blitted
Cause I be feenin for that pookie
I smoke the good shhh, save the backyard boogie for all groupies
And I be, smokin up the hotel lobby
Between mo' sheets than the Isleys, I'm high G
I'm holdin it down for the B-Rrrah-I-C
K, blaze, tell you to get bluhh politely
(Hit the funky if you're riding around gettin blitz)
Ask me if I love the rap game -- I, I'm loving it

Blaze the poot with D. Don and tell UHH to get the dillz

How we doin', yeah, Ill Na Na
Uh huh, uh, come on

[Verse 1: Foxy Brown]
What up pop? brace yourself as I ride on top
Close your eyes as you ride right out your socks
Double, lose his mind as he grind in the tunnel
Wanna give me the cash he made off his last bundle
Nasty girl, don't pass me the world
I push the V, not the backseat girl
Don't deepthroat for c-notes, she floats
Murder she wrote and keeps the heat close
Firm nigga, we 'posed to be the illest on three coasts
Familia, bigger than Icos
Y'all Danny DeVitos, small niggas
All I see is the panty eaters, that's all, niggas
Loan sharkin' this year, raise the figgas
Fifteen percent make the whole world sit up
And take notice, Na Na take over
Y'all take quotas to hit papa

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Straight out the gate y'all, we drop hits
Now tell me, how nasty can you get
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods
It's ripped, one thing for sure

That's right we drop hits
Now tell me, how nasty can you get
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods
It's ripped, one thing for sure

[Verse 2: Foxy Brown & Jay Z]
I'm too live, nasty as I wanna be
Don't shake your sassy ass in front of me
'Fore I take you there and tear your back out
That shit ain't happened since The Mack was out
I'm Lola Falana, dripped in Gabbana
Nineties style, the finest style
Right away it's the fit, wanna taste the shit
Put me on the basin, throw your face in it, fucker
Na Na, y'all can't touch her
My sex drive all night like a trucker
Let alone the skills I possess
And y'all gon' see by these mil's I possess
Never settle for less, I'm in excess
Not inexpensive VVS
To the two, that's just the way I'm built
Nasty, but classy, still

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Straight out the gate y'all, we drop hits

[Bridge: Jay-Z]
Well you can hold what I got, roll with the Roc
A-Fella capo in the candy apple drop
Will tears fall to your ears if I don't stop?
Can ya throw it like a quarterback, third and a lot?

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
Dig me, I'll get you locked like Biggie with herb in the spot
Word middie, the cop 'n biddie
Uhh, I'm the bomb-diggy, punana
Sexy brown thing, uh, Madon' y'all
Make 'em turn over from the full-court pressure
To undress ya and shit all over your asses
I ain't playin' knockin' out at the weigh-in
I'm sayin', what's the sense in delayin'
I'm tryin to run G from the P to the A.M
I saw your little thing now I'm swayin', OK'in

[Intro]
Yeah
You know what?
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on, playette
Play on, playette
Yo, Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow-wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

[Verse 3: Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low-key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Oh, yeah)

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a **** thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We bes the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-**** broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your **** Chauncy
I'll be sending the call, let's say, around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity (No diggity, no doubt, baby)

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)

(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it

240,Renee,Legal Drug Money,Lost Boyz,1996,293866,54,"

[Verse 1]
Here's a tune about this honey named Renee that I met one day
On my way back from John Jay
I'm peeping shorty as she's walking to the train
I tap her on her shoulders
""Excuse me miss, but can I get your name?""
She said, my name is Renee
I said I got a whole lot to say, so may I walk you to your subway?
She said if you want, so yo, we started talking
I bought two franks and two drinks and we began walking
I had to see where that head was at cause her gear was mad fat
So we must chat about this and that
She told me what she was in school for
She wants to be a lawyer, in other words, shorty studies law
I'm telling shorty I'm a writer
And as she's looking for the token, she drops a package of the EZ Wider
Covers her mouth with her name ring
I said, yo don't sweat the technique, shorty rocks, I do the same thing
But yet I use Philly blunts
She said, ""I never dealt with Philly blunts
Because I heard that's for silly stunts""
I said nah they burn slower
Right now I really don't know ya
But maybe later on, I can get to show you

[Hook]
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

[Verse 2]
So now we sitting on the train
Besides her fingernails, now shorty got the hairdo of pain
Now understand she got flava
A tough leather jacket with some jeans and a chain that her moms gave her
Got off the train about 6:34
She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog, so we hit the store
Went to the crib and turned the lights on
A mad magazine stand
From Essence to Right On
A leather couch, stereo system with crazy CDs
Understand, kid, she got G's
She said Cheeks, do what you want
She said I'm gonna feed the dog
I said, alright well I'ma roll this blunt
She came back with stretch pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt
A yo, fam I got a tender-roni girl
We're sitting on the couch chatting
We're smoking blunts off the balcony
We're staring at Manhattan now
She started feeling on my chest
I started feeling on the breasts
And there's no need for me to stress the rest
A yo, I got myself a winner
We sparked a blunt before we ate and a blunt after we ate dinner
She had a tattoo she only wanted go to see
But first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci
I'm like whatever, shorty rock, we can swing it like that
'Cause on the real this is where it's at

[Hook]
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

[Verse 3]
I woke up the next day on the waterbed
A letter's on the pillow and this what the letter said
It said, ""Cheeks, I'll be home around two
You was deep in your sleep so I didn't want to bother you""
I left my number for shorty to call me later
Got dressed, smoked a blunt, and then I bounced towards the elevator
I got a beep around three
I'm asking shorty what's up with you, she's asking what's up with me
And now we been together for weeks
Candlelight dinner with my shorty, crack a forty with my naughty freaks
Hey man, I never been in love
But every time I'm burstin' in and outta state, it's Shorty that I'm thinking of
I'm hanging out with my crew
I get a beep from Renee because Renee uses Code Two
But yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes
She says ""Renee has been shot, so Cheeks, meet me up at St. Luke's""
I jumps on the Van Wyck, I gotta make it there quick
Ay yo , this shit is gettin' mad thick
Not even thinking about the po-nine
I'm doing a buck, who gives a fuck, I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine
I gotta see what's going on
But by the time I reach the hospital, they tell me ""Mr. Cheeks, Renee is gone""
I'm pouring beer out for my Shorty who ain't here
I'm from the ghetto, so listen, this is how I shed my tears

[Hook]
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings
Uhh, bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas in low riders and ski masks
Screamin', ""Thug Life"" every time they pass, all eyes on me

So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Mediocres got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me

The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress

Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money

[Verse 1: André 3000]
One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago, on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hookup
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil, and plus, my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like ""Freeze!"" We making the crowd move
But we not making no G's and that's a no-no

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Check it, a-one-two, a-one
""Two dope niggas in the Cadillac,"" they call us
Went from ""Player's Ball"" to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say ""motherfuck that playin'"", they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day; niggas, they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
I'm out this bitch

[Hook]
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rallys, bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses, passes getting thrown like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma, I want to sing
But, momma, I want to trick, and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now""
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82
Me and you like Tony! Toni! Tone!
Like this, East Point and we gone

[Hook]
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""Hey, man, you remember me from school?""
""No, not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

[Hook]
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you

243,Ya Playin' Yaself,Wrath Of The Math,Jeru The Damaja,1996-01-01,226800,49,"

[Verse 1]
Now, I don't push a Lex
Others had their turn to flex, Jeru is up next
All these so called players up in the rap game
Got brothers on the corner selling cooked cocaine
It used to be LaToya and jim hats
But now it's Uzis, Macs and G-packs of cracks
Everybody's psycho or some type of good fellow
But me I keep it real that's all swine like jello
Don't drink Cristal, and I can't stand Mo
Never received currency for moving a kilo
Or an ounce, make em bounce to this fake-pimp-free flow
I never knew hustlers confessed in stereo
Or on video get caught you'll know who turned state's
Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints
Mama always said watch what comes out your mouth
Tight case for the DA from here to down South
Knowledge wisdom understanding like King Solomon's wealth
You're a player but only because you be playing yourself

[Hook]
With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

[Verse 2]
Now these ladies is looking pretty from city to city
I refined a few I met, around the country
The nitty gritty, it's all reality, no question
Actual fact like tight jeans cause yeast infections
And sisters with good minds, get no respect when
Their ass is all hanging out, playing the bar section
Of the club shake what your mama gave ya, back to the lab
I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft
Or a way to get ass, or fast cash, or blasted
Black women, make sure you're respected
When niggas is kicking that old off the wall shit, let em know
From jump: ""Dead it"", you're not ignorant
Knowledge wisdom understanding is the key to wealth
Put some clothes on that ass if you respect yourself

[Hook]
With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

[Verse 3]
Now, I don't bust a Tec, bubble drugs
In the projects, or use mics to sell sex
Niggas, nowadays is all about this
So much ying yang, it's ridiculous
If you got so much cheese where are the black distributors
And these record companies shake em down like mobsters
But impostors, like commercial locks are not rastas
Always faking moves, never, making moves
Asses shake, bottles pop, the government is breaking down you fools
You work all week and give the devil back his loot for jewels
And the steak on your plate is filled with chemicals
Still, brothers leave brothers all battered and bruised
On the streets, won't see snakes on my feet
The race is on, but I won't compete
In this competition, because I have a greater mission
I hope that you listen
Knowledge wisdom and understanding brings, long life
And health, think anything else and ya playin' yaself

[Hook]
So all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
And all those skin tight jeans hon you're playin' yaself
And all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

And all those hooker type wears baby you're playin' yaself
And all that big gun talk money you're playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

[Chorus: Black Thought]
I came too far to front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo
You can't front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, y'all know the dynasty, The Roots repertoire
The Lieutenant from the reservoir, serve to spar
The injurer, predator of a competitor
I send MCs where the paramedics are
At first, I'm like ""Nah"", I'm nonchalant from afar
Then strike to cut the fake rap star jugular
With irregular balance of the cat burgalar
Known to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars
I know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual
We congruent, lay on the corner with the traum' unit
I'm from the lab where the bomb's distributed
So never try to duplicate the skills executed
Son, you'd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed
Shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it
Some know me as the man that's from The Roots crew
Others as Bad Lieutenant off of Snyder Avenue
We go a eye for a eye, behead ya like a samurai
That'll command the dynasty until he die
Who will imply that I lack abilit-y?
Make your words known, amplify the utilit-y
I'm crooked like the 'I' on a toxic malt liquor
The Land whipper, the Dom Perignon champ sipper
The Fifth'll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather
The Bad Lieu'll bring the bad weather
So to whoever got riff, let it rest, reflect
Then recollect on the way it was set
It's the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex
Be on the low, shotgun in the Lex
So with my man, low to flex
I’m restin' where they handle the TECs
And the lyrical vandal is next to flow, so
My man, my MZA, my man
M-ilitant, what’s the master plan?
Once again…

[Chorus x2: Black Thought]
I came too far to front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo

[Verse 2: Malik B]
Peep the oratory, niggas bore me with theatrics
Moms listen to they daughter story about my package
The adverse is on your table, stabilize emotion
A soldier at ease, but on post, the utmost and
Brag and boast in my anecdotes that choke
Invade your whole terrain, you feel the pain provoke
When I breaststroke your wavelength of intensity
My alliance bring forth to you an entity
Your whole vicinity, I contaminate with hate
Got no time to debate, but hold up, wait, sit straight
It’s M-Ill, the elicit, you violate, you get a ticket
MC's, you can't tell, I expel, you get evicted
From out your misery, serve your ass with my delivery
Allah makes the ground you steppin' on shivery
Permanent tears run through your thoughts, you queers
It's all upstairs, where there's a crowd, table and chairs
For years, been on the mic, I'm like a dyke with stares
When I strike, I stay severe, niggas, they lower their glare
From over here my Range Rover swear to blast off socks
Switch the pitch from southpaw to unorthodox
I shock your brain with the miscellaneous
Who beez the zaniest nigga with words that are spontaneous?

[Bridge: Black Thought]
Ayo, the purpose mainly is to generate the Luther Van
Lyrical contraband, controllin' your command and...

[Chorus x2: Black Thought]
You can't front, I'm comin' with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in ya section and throughout ya section
In ya area, throughout your whole section, yo

[Outro: Black Thought]
All the way live from 2-1-5, all the way live from the 6-1-0
Gettin' cash, get the gusto
One time, it's the dynasty flow
Runnin' it down the line, it's another
Yeah, you in tune to another ill Fifth Dynasty production, baby

(To the beat y'all! To the beat y'all! Just clap your hands, just clap your hands...)
To the L, to the Y and the T to the E
So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me
(Rock the house, rock the house, rock the house)

[Hook]
Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

[Verse 1]
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred
I'm a veteran, which means that I've been
In the game too long, since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I flow like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Spectacular over M-I-C
I go for broke, never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request
You like the rhyme, bite if you dare
I get the paper so I don't care
Fly that's me; the epitomy
Of what a real MC is supposed to be
Fucking you up every time that I drop
I fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look, it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
It's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun
If you don't understand then say you don't (nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best (say what?)
West to East, see East to West
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive
Cause it's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics
I got many witnesses that can back this
Ruffnecks, from New York to L.A
Been down with me since Poor George
It's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
Make the ill type moves, I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Get out my shit, please let me be
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that
Trying to get over like a fat rat
But I understand I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop
It goes on, on, on, on
You see, the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver
Chilling with
A pina colada, kidada hooked me up
With Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere, that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you?
You better get down with your real crew
'Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it yeah?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alizé
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Nigga shot ya from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Production by Erick Sermon]

[Intro: E Dub]
Microphone check, one, two (I can feel it)
Ayo, you ready to get down man? (Yo, whatever, man)
You ready to get drunk as fuck? (Whatever, man)
You, you sayin somethin'? (Whatever, man)
Ayo (Whatever, man)
(I can feel it) Check it, Kool V
I keeps it bangin', keep it swangin', Mike type of sangin' (Yeah)
Ooh, la, la, la (So what ya sayin'?)

[Verse 1: Redman, Erick Sermon]
Yo, I'm smokin' herbals 'til it hurts you
I keep your daughter way out past her curfew
Hard, far from commercial (So whatcha mean, nigga?)
We don't give a fuck when we smoked out
In the land that's doped out
(It's like that?) No doubt
From this bomb weed, I cop from the streets
Get you open like buttcheeks from girls who be freaks
Ayo, can I be SWV? (You the One, nigga)
Rap Shogun, yes, E the one
Yo, I'm rolling with a forty pack of niggas
Get my weed from Branson 'cause his sack's bigger
Yo, give me dap, nigga
What I clap lyrically tap call back
Ferocious, causing comatoses to collapse
So chinky-eyed I see people waving on a map
I make it hotter than your thermostats
Bomb MC's with rough megahertz so call me
Funk Doctor verbal starburst, lyrical expert
Your boombox better form a union
'Cause I leave your circuits overworked, word bond
Niggas front like they want it
But I be in the five hundred with E steadily gettin' blunted
Damn nigga, you cool at what you spittin'
So why you holding the blunt so long politickin'? (Huh)
I ace them blunts with the technician of electrician
I don't got a pot to piss in but still spend my last on hydroglycerin
I keep it live, no jive, rolling dutches
That's Masters like the Furious Five
I keep your crew chinky-eyed, for bitches actin' dog
(Can you hit it from the back?)
Why not? While we toke on this (I can feel it)

[Chorus]
(I can feel it)
Yo, yo, you ready to roll this weed up? (Whatever, man)
You ready to knock this nigga out? (Whatever, man)
Yo, you ready to get this chedda? (Whatever, man)
You ready to start this shit off? (Whatever, man) (I can feel it)

[Verse 2: Redman]
I smoked with a lot of college students
Most of 'em wasn't graduating and they knew it
You know the weed slang? Yeah, boy, I speak it fluent
I light your college dorm with my entourage from Newark
Bigger they come, harder they fall
That goes for knuckleheads, MCs, pussy walls and all
I lit my first L before I started to crawl
I got my ass whooped when I had my first brawl
But things changed since I was twelve years old
I specialize in wreckin' mics and area codes now
PPP the kinda niggas that'll bug with ya
Smoke bud with ya, later on stick a slug in ya
Everything that's light green ain't the bomb, bitch
I got different forms to make you lose your calm, bitch
Read my lips, you ain't hittin' unless you got
Ten on it, get on it, or get the fuck out my cypher (I can feel it)

[Chorus]
You ready to roll this weed up? (Whatever, man)
You ready to rob this nigga? (Whatever, man) (I can feel it)
You ready to fuck, bitch? (Whatever, man)
You ready to guzzle this liquor? (Whatever, man) (I can feel it)

[Outro]
Whatever, man
Whatever, man (I can feel it)
Whatever, man
Whatever, man (I can feel it)

251,Respond/ React,Illadelph Halflife,The Roots,1996-09-24,307120,39,"

[Intro: Black Thought]
It's just - hip-hop hangin in my head heavy
Malik said ""Riq, you know the planet ain't ready
For the half"" when we comin' with the action pack
On some Dundee shit representin' the outback
Yo, we do it like this (All the way live, from 2-1-5)
You witnessin' the 5th Dynasty family click
(All the way live, from 2-1-5)
Across the map, one time for ya (All the way live, from 2-1-5)
It's time to react to respond to react to respond (All the way live, from 2-1-5)

[Hook]
We settin' it from Southside, pushin' this up North
From Illadelphian reps, to fly points across the map
Bring it back to Respond/React
Then bring it back to Respond/React to this

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
The attractive assassin, blastin' the devil trespassin'
Master gettin' cash in an orderly fashion
Message to the fake nigga flashin':
Slow up, Ock, before you get dropped and closed like a caption
Fractional kids don't know the time for action
Styles got the rhythm that of an Anglo-Saxon
Round of applause, an avalanche of clappin'
{*BLOW*} That's what happen, now what's your reaction?
We heavyweight traction, pro-pornographin'
Specialize in science and math and
Original black man, bustin' thoughts that pierce your mental
The fierce rippin' your sacks and
Vocal toe-to-toe impeccable, splittin' your back, son
Simple as addition and subtraction
Black Thought, the infinite relaxed one
Shorties say they love it with a passion
Bring the international traum', see a squad I harass

[Verse 2: Malik B]
REACT, you best adapt when I sling this rap
Another chapter, before when I have to trap ya
Map your whole path out
Go get your crowd so we can clap out
I drive down streets and take back route positionin'
When I'm in your system like glycerin
Fans listenin' from Michigan to Switzerland
Malik be bliss again - on the station with the discipline
Solicitin', sometimes illicit or explicit with it and
From the deep end where the hills are steep
Nobody cares to speak, a land where life is cheap
The street mentality, mixed with the intellect personality
Hell where I dwell as well
Niggas rebellious, bodies are found down in the cellars
My man caught a shot to the stomach, now who want it?
Confronted by these dusty blunted cats who act
Like they don't know that the fact is that they're bein' hunted
A process of elimination
Activate your mind with the stimulation
Enter your zone with penetration
I've seen more horror than Bram Stroker
Strip your broad or play poker, then drink mocha
The sometimes socializer, the joke despiser
You woke the wiser, dealin' with The Roots' vocalizer
Up in your flesh from South Philly to West
I stampede your style, I'll compile then bless

[Hook x2]
We settin' it from Southside, pushin' this up North
From Illadelphian reps, to fly points across the map
Bring it back to Respond/React
Then bring it back to Respond/React to this

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Aiyo, I'm just a lyricist, a chemist of the hemp
The beat pimp, the ill Philly resident
That's far from hesitant, corrupt like a president
Never benevolent, but poetically prevalent
Cooler than peppermint
The Lieutenant for niggas talkin' 'bout represent
No doubt, it's obviously evident I get bent
Far from temporary, son, I'm very permanent
Hittin' MC's like an intoxicant, sent to prevent
Monopoly is my intent, the means is what I invent
This mental murder pay the rent
Lyrically, I'm the dominant ingredient, the swift extravagant
Smooth lubricant, down with the M-the-Ill-itant
(Ch-ch-ch...) That's the sound of the Dynasty chant
We surround your camp, assumin' the war stance
And bring it from the chest, now let's daaance

[Verse 4: Malik B]
M-ILL-ITANT! Feel The Fifth guerilla chant
Y'all talk about bodies but you would not kill a ant
My skill is amp, would peel a nigga like a stamp
Caliber is of Excalibur, now you be damp
When I operate, a crowd will copulate
My game'll make a room populate
And 2-1-5th is the stock of hate
Peep the logistics, slump your squad of misfits
They all get they wrists slit, blast your ass if you insist it
Leave no trace so there's no trace for ballistics
Turn your soul and body to statistics
In particular, I've got that extracurricular
Squad in the stash who could be stickin' ya
Slip and they vickin' ya
Harass your po-lice commissioner
Don't like chicks with weaves talkin' 'bout, ""I need conditioner""
That shit's deader than niggas with a morticianer
A jenazah, up in your flesh like plasma
Take away your last breath when you got asthma
Then meet Bad Lieu down at the plaza
Hip-hop extravaganza, tell your man I slump him with a stanza
Now ""Who's the Boss?"", not Tony Danza
My force not green but the force is obscene
P.O. took a piss test it came out not clean
Brody with my man Miz-Moose and Hakeem
My squad from deuce-four up to West Oak Lane
All the way to Tackawanna and Frankford, they know the name
It's like that... M-Ill-itant

[Bridge: Black Thought]
M-Ill-itant, lyrically hostile, Bad Lieutenant
Check it out, foul style, check it out

[Hook x4]
We settin' it from Southside, pushin' this up North
From Illadelphian reps, to fly points across the map
Bring it back to Respond/React
Then bring it back to Respond/React to this

252,It's Been A Long Time,The 18th Letter / The Book Of Life,Rakim,1996-11-04,237666,50,"

[Hook: Samples with Scratches by DJ Premier]
“It’s been a long time” (x4)
“Rakim… the microphone soloist”

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Follow procedures.  The crowd couldn’t wait to see this
Nobody been this long-awaited since Jesus
Who wouldn’t believe this?  I heard the word on the street is
I’m still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas. They said
I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of
So I made some more to put the New World in Order
With mathematics, put your status above the average
And help you rappers make paragraphs with graphics
‘Cause new days is dawning, new ways of performing
Brainstorming, I write and watch the night turn to morning
On and on, and I got the whole world responding
Rock, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warning
The emperor well-known for inventing a sentence
Full of adventure, turning up the temperature
Rush with adrenaline.  How long has it been again
To be in the state of mind that Rakim is in?

[Hook: Samples with Scratches by DJ Premier]
“It’s been a long time”
“Rakim… the microphone soloist”
“It’s been a long time” (x2)
“Rakim”

[Verse 2: Rakim]
When I’m out propping, either hanging or shopping
People see me, stop and ask me when the album dropping
The wait is over.  In formation like a soldier, like I
Told ya: greater, stronger, now that I’m older. I broke the
Code of silence with overloads of talents
My only challenge is not to explode in violence
I’m Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit—at least
Once during the course of a day—it’s automatic
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian pharaoh
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow
Allah’s monotony—so far, they can’t stop me.  You know
Ra want property like Muammar Gaddafi
More thoughts than Bibles, recitals taught disciples
A sawed-off mic, so words scatter like a rifle
Thoughts that’s trifle, I’m busting these for you.  Ayyo
Technical difficulties is through

[Hook: Samples with Scratches by DJ Premier]
“It’s been a long time”
“Rakim… the microphone soloist”
“It’s been a long time”
“Rakim… the microphone soloist”
“It’s been a long time”
“Rakim… the microphone soloist”
“It’s been a long time” (x2)

[Verse 3: Rakim]
When I float
At night, I show ‘em new heights I go to write.  They know
I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic
Critics and biters don’t know where my source of light is
Still leave authors and writers with arthritis
Cursed kids like the pyramids when they found the style
First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile
The rebirth of hip-hop’ll be dropped now ‘cause the crowd
Didn’t hear the original in a while
So be alarmed.  What you ‘bout to see is the bomb like
3D in ‘Nam, vivid like CD-Rom
Info kept like internet.com, my note-
-book’s my bond like the Holy Quran
Since I came in the door—said it before
But, no, I ain’t down with Eric B. no more
At night, the open mic be inviting me to rhyme
So, yo, I’m online
It’s been a long time

[Hook: Samples with Scratches by DJ Premier]
“It’s been a long time” (x2)
“Rakim… the microphone soloist”
“It’s been a long time”
“Rakim… the microphone soloist”
“It’s been a long time” (x5)

253,3 Tha Hard Way,Kollage,Bahamadia,1996-01-01,252400,45,"

[Verse 1: Bahamadia]
Salutes to action be the latest en-t-ry for 'Illadel colonies
To get the cream like cherries jubilee
My steeze put you at ease like methamphetamine
Or like Tony Starks fantasies about his Wallabees
Too fitting, ya mean? Big East be comin' through
Ghetto magic plus the bullies back it what
Me now Buddah Blessed for I-and-I provide the greatest na-tural
Pure as life that exit from the gentatile
Styles international like direct connects from internet
Verbal text blossom like Chia Pets
Perfect with the mic devices Bahamadi' be the nicest
Bringin' this rap thing to the light like Osiris
For the Nine pound et cetera
Peace to Gang Starr and my nigga K-Sarrah

[Hook]
""We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way""

[Verse 2: K-Swift]
Ayo, I'm doing this for the crews claimin' that they're better
I'm tickled, ya must be like Sanford on the ripple little by little
I kick verses of the middle of my brain
The Riddler couldn't fuck wit Kannon Riddles, I remain
The undisputed, you should've known if you knew it
Montell couldn't tell you how we do it
If you got the chance to even do the battle dance with the Kannon Band
Shit be slammin' more than Larry Nance
And plus it's in me to give you more like Demi
I do it easy, leave the hard-a-way to penny
As I display skills for what it's worth
Sent to this Earth to put the curse of wack MCs upon my turf
This is the end like Armageddon, you're settin' a bad example
Niggas still using samples times ample
Yo Swift never said she was the baddest but I kept it real
You niggas frontin', talkin' 'bout you packin' steel
You be sportin' a foot all up in rectum
By them Central kids sittin' all up in the bully section
Wreckin'

[Hook]
""We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way""
""We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way""
""We gonna rock this motherfucker like Three The Hard Way""

[Verse 3: Mecca Starr]
Do you remember those you chose to forget
Back when ya ears was wet?
And now ya preachin' me releasin' mini-tec
I need a mic check because the static comes sporadic
Emcees be hooked like addicts while casualties stay tragic
There ain't no glamour in that story, all guts no glory
Entrenced in jealousy just like the suckers who abhor me
They tell but they don't know the core
So raw is now my reference
Like Mumia there is no evidence to say I am more than I am
Undbending, never ending similar to million men
Me say ""just us"" you say ""me bust bust""
Mental stagnation like the cancer patients eatin' cow fuss
As the minds rust
From dawn to dusk I rest in Mecca
The words sound power as in energy see Heka
To die because ya black simply be no cause at all
Surreality just like the legends of the fall
Initial looks of the shook hearted kids who shouldn't have started
Lyrics leave like spirits and the waters Moses parted
Do or Die's ya slogan but niggas slip with Trojans
Major mental corrosion like Murray's meat unfrozen
I am the Chosen, Earth, Sun, Moon and stars
Hard for me to find a top contender just to spar
Some peep the exterior and think inferior
Next ya know they callin' for a Sound Bwoy Burial
D&D Studio be wicked, catch wreck for infinity
One love peace to Bahamadi'

[Verse 4: Bahamadia]
Like Salt-N-Pepa I take it to the next plateau
Niggas scream they what this Brown Sugar like D'Angelo
I make it better fo' fantanics fienin' for the butter, boo
Like 25 to lifers do from lack of gettin' Power-U
Oh, I put my little thing in action, smooth like satin
Or Special Ed when he was taxin'
Heads relax and play the back when I spill
I regulate a flow like chicks on birth control pills
Ill anitics, keep it movin' on
Bouncin' like nylon from 'Illadel to Lebanon (no doubt)
It's 3 Tha Hard Way

254,Hay,The Final Tic,Crucial Conflict,1996-01-01,260240,45,"

[Hook]
Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn
Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn

[Verse 1]
Sittin on a quarter P of hay, thangs is feelin good today
I'm tore up, from the floor up, sippin on some Crown Royal
Trippin, in a circle of wood where everybody smoke they own bud
Good ole' hay, how you feel today? Fine, blowed and dandy
Silly like I'm hype off candy, gotta big, thick chick named sandy
In the farm in the middle of the barn where everybody's feelin crazy
I went to visit granny's house, now I see why don't nobody leave
We constantly, constantly, constantly smokin B's
Too blitzed to even shake it off, but I still got my head up
Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn and get my big black peter sucked
Pass the hay you silly slut, blaze it up so I can hit that bud
Get me zoned and i'll be on cause I love to smoke upon hay

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wildstyle]
The hay got me goin through a stage and I just can't get enough
Smokin everyday, I got some hay and you know I'm finna roll it up
Make a cloud, I'm gonna take my mind away from all the bullcrap
Bump my sounds, lay back and roll, mack to the freaks that's on the road
Sometimes I wonder when I was blowed on the streets
Anybody wanna step to me, I'mma see how rough they be
In this session, manifesting on my P's and Q's, never snooze cause I refuse
Inhale, exhale the smell, smokin hay all by myself
Wildstyle, laughin loud, wit my homies by my side
If somethin jump off let it ride, on my square when time is live
Everybody throw it up, go to the barn and get some hay
When I get my choke on, fool you know I'm smokin on......

[Verse 3]
Hay now hay, we smokin up hay in the middle of the barn
And I'm lit up, can't get up, my eyes are red and my head is spinnin
Took another pull, ridin red bull, got the goofies, can't stop grinnin
Got a posse full of hoes playin in my braids and we bout to get in em
Over yonder is the barn where the pals be at and everything funny
Gotta pause some nigga tryna blow my high smokin all that hay with no money
Now truly this bitch wanna do me, so I hit the 151 Bacardi
She high like the sun, thick like cornbread and I'm ready to party
That hay got me so gotdamn horny but I don't like that tramp
The only reason I'm poppin that coochie cause the ho had a book of foodstamps
And I got the munchies, I need soul food, collard greens or pinto beans
If you smoke hay like the conflict do, then you know what the hell I mean

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Rollin down the block
Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat door crack
Got my niggas in the barn smokin on that hay stack
Back up on the scene from smokin herb so creep up on the wall and all I heard
Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in the hay with a funky dime word
Couldn't be myself, couldn't smoke wit nobody else
If I didn't pass it to the left, nigga would have lost my breath
Open up the window 'fore I fall and faint but I can't cause I roll around in dat barn ride
Rollin up the hootie hoo, roughest skin roller on dat west side
Nigga come on in, I got some hay, won't you close dat barn door
Nigga what you let them flies out for? Ain't nobody to rich, we poor
Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn, the flies keep us chokin
Thank you Jesus Christ for all the hay you're givin us cause we'll keep on smokin'

To get the dough and the guns, and then we straight
He had the block locked he knew the spot block
On some real web shit to get your spot knocked by killer cops
Tryin to get your shit rocked, he don't know, cause all along
We was plottin to drop on the low, he straight snitch

[Intro: Black Thought]
To all the Jim Carrey-ass, Mars Co-op
KnowhatI'msayin? Mars Co-op, what the fuck?
To the clones, we bless the domes
Blow the vial, you know my style, large co-op
Freestyle all the way, son
Dice

[Verse 1: M.A.R.S]
First of all, let's talk about these ill capers
And fly-ass frontin' bitches that now caught vapors
Niggas run up on you with guns, snatchin' papers
Outlined body chalk, is how they would scrape ya
From off the pavement, I hate gettin' locked up
'Cause that upstate bus reminds me of the slave ships
But then The Bible never saved shit
I guess that's why every juvenile is in the same predicament
You wanna slang crack, or hold TECs, and do the concept
You can't make loot when your moms is smokin' up the product
I try to tell ya, don't let these streets fuckin' fail ya
The way niggas be gettin' clapped, the shit'll fuckin' scare ya
But in the dark, we ran wild, son, we killin' em
Niggas scared, can't stand still like fuckin' helium
Fake niggas, they don't go platinum, they go aluminum
Got 'em cloned the fuck up, son, that's why we losin' 'em
I'm lookin' at this nigga's longevity
To make a big play, but then, it might be a mistake
'Cause if I get sent to D.C., I'm sendin' Dice to D.E
With three P's, so when I get out, he can see me
For real, 'cause the streets is filled with snakes and rats
The snake will be that bitch and that rat will be that cool cat
With swollen pockets we gonna take you back home
Master-Allah-Rule-Savior, never clone

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
I use the mic to slap you in the face and erase your taste
Disgrace your date, put your title to waste
Dominant lyrical grace from a place
Called wild Illa Del Val Pennsy - that's the residency
Consistent currency, my pocket's never empty
Some cats believe they MC, but we know they all fraud
Do a show in Philly, niggas wouldn't applaud
Nobody know your record nor who you openin' for
Can tell your squad's artificial while approachin' the door
So you should prepare for lyrical terror that's pure
Step up to the reservoir of the soul proprietor style Messiah or
The kaya lord, down with Dice Raw
The matador, shorty connoisseur
Stompin' whatever you build to the floor
Similar to that of a dinosaur
I told you I'm the rap predator
You insist to imitate, what for?
Superstar niggas is 10% real
90% invented for a fuckin' record deal
Comin' with somethin' veterans can't feel
I hit you like a steel anvil
Because you grafted off the next man's skill
But still, I remain mellow, seein' the theatrics of Othello
But know the tactics of the P.L.O
These C-L-O-N-E-S fess
The phoniest cats is felonious, word

[Verse 3: Dice Raw]
Dice Raw, the juvenile lyricist, corner store terrorist
Block trooper, connoisseur of fine cannabis
Focus never weak, blow up the spot like plastique
Leave a nigga shook, to the point he won't speak
Never half-assed, always live and direct
On bitches try to punk, smell the panty and raw sex
Mad lights, I had to black out when fake niggas act out
Or step out of place, they get slapped in they face
All y'all niggas is fake, tryin' to emulate my style
What grown man? In this game, to me you're a child
I trained wack MC's in camps like ex-Marines
Why the fuck you think you went home and had bad dreams
Of horrifyin' things that your ass never seen before?
You traveled to the realm of Dice Raw
Where clones get they domes blown with chrome microphones
It's not your fault, black, just the fact you wasn't shown
You'll come through this like a smurf
Unnatural, it’s not from this earth
Represent while I been like this since birth
And I won't be the last, but I definitely was the first
Dice Raw, big car Logan Val' sol-dier

[Verse 4: Malik B]
Don't come across that line or pay a cost
Knuckle games and hammer cocked, ain't nothin' sweet or soft
Win, lose or draw, to the jaw take one
Deranged lyrical launcher, or station
No conversation is needed, my task completed
Read a nigga up and down in the cut where I'm seated
Snatch you from your cloud of cannabis, you ignoramuses
You laid on your lap when I attacked your glamorous
Lifestyle, I banged your head up with the right fowl
My character a product of this 2-1-5th trife style
I breeze through areas niggas would fear to walk in
Balance the talkin', that galactic style is of a Vulcan
Your Star Trek ass will wrinkle
Spill these words and form into a sprinkle
Cat, you're brought up and the name of twinkle
My insight will crack the windpipe of y'all niggas
Whether small, middle-sized or tall niggas
Just sign your name next when I start to X
Givin' out flesh pains of death, so fuck a rain check
The insane vet, whether you ganked the brain wet
You proceed to lame check, the opposite of same sex
I annihilate your type if you violate
Makin' your blood rush, your pulse now at a higher rate

Uh!
Uh!
Uh!

258,Infinite,Infinite,Eminem,1996-11-12,251707,54,"

[Produced by Mr. Porter & Jeff Bass]

[Intro]
Aw, yeah (It's like this, like this)
It's Eminem, baby
Back up in that motherfuckin' ass
('Til forever, 'til forever)
One time for your motherfuckin' mind (For MC's, MC's)
We represent the 313—you know what I’m sayin'?
Yo, they don’t know shit about this, for the '96

[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany actin' maniac in action
A brainiac, in fact, son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs
My rhymin' skills got you climbin' hills
I travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills
I'm slimin' grills of roaches with spray that disinfects
And twistin' necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist 'em up and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm Infinite

[Verse 2]
Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
Some fruit to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one
Imitator intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My acappella releases classic masterpieces, through telekinesis
It eases you mentally, gently
Sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm Infinite

[Verse 3]
Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster real in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be
‘Cause once you make an instant hit, I'm tensed a bit
And tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
I'm Infinite

[Hook]
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm Infinite
You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it, but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it
I'm Infinite

259,Spontaneity,Kollage,Bahamadia,1996-01-01,248035,37,"

[Verse 1]
Straight outta the metro rhythm central
I'm innovative at the intro, 'cause I go slow mo'
But never slow pulse
But never no joke, dope
But never no coke
Spits the riddles like phlegm
Loose with my lyrics like I double jointed them
Twist and I bend, common episodes past freak modes
The monstrous bass beneath my pace be like morse code
Slash, beep, slash, beep, scanners
Zero in to the system in your jeeps
I'm out there with Kool Keith and Ced-Gee and De La
Inventors of my third seeing eye
The futuristic vision, I'm not among loony nut cakes upon a mission
I gets in where I fit in, 'cause life's too short
So you could all label me weirdo, but yo
I know it's talent

[Hook]
Mad explosive spontaneity

[Verse 2]
At present I speak the new
Beginning when every other trend fell short
So who'll be the shareholder of my kinda thoughts besides the studious
'Cause the gluteus maximus lack ability
To scoop all capabilities of spontaneity within me
Depicted kicked it true
Vibes pops jazz but collaborated with the cool
Known flows, but unfamiliar grooves that soothe
Individuals' moods like soul food for thought

[Hook]
Mad explosive spontaneity

[Verse 3]
Rip here be dizz like everybody's on it
'Cause eternal verbal expansion
Keeps enhancing brainchild's ability to like surpass a swarm of booty
Ass, no grass roots having ass MCs with lukewarm degrees
Trying to get hot like sun rays, but save your jazz for Sun Ra
You know I wanna spar
My skills fill up the outer limits like Mars and you's a little star
I jacked your twinkle when I excelled well
Like Tinkerbell up to higher levels and heights
Cerebral flow takes flight on airborne time
I'm a prime candidate of specimen in your Walkman as you're listening
I make things happen, 'cause I'm the captain, keepin' this great

[Hook]
Mad explosive spontaneity

260,The 18th Letter (Always And Forever),The 18th Letter / The Book Of Life,Rakim,1996-11-04,180933,37,"

[Verse]
Just when things seem the same, and the whole scene is lame
I come and reign with the unexplained
For the brains 'til things change
They strain to sling slang, I'm trained to bring game
History that I arranged been regained by King James
Go to practice with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics
Women that look like actresses, the status of Cleopatra's
Stacks of mathematics to feed yo' Asiatics
As I find out, what the facts is, for geographic
No time to sip Mo's with hostess
Never mind what the total gross is
I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese with soldiers
While you hit trees and coast, I spit flows that be ferocious
And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses
Shine permanently, only my mind's concernin' me
Fire burns in me eternally, time's eternity
Followers turn on me, they'll be in a mental infirmary
Determinedly advance technology better than Germany
Since the first days you know of, 'til the last days is over
I was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah
From a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom
Some of my rap patterns still surround Saturn
From the ancient hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures
I study, I know the scriptures, but nowaday ain't it vicious?
Date back, I go beyond, check the Holy Qu'ran
To speeches at the Audobon, now we get our party on
So bein' beneficent, I bless 'em with dialogue
They expectin' the next testament by the God
I roam through battle zones with chrome for chaperone
Blast beat with saxophones, one of the baddest rappers known
Every country, city and borough, side-street and ghetto
Island, alley and meadow, theory's thorough enough to echo
When it was one mass of land, with one nat' of man
And the whole mass was ran under one master plan
Since the world's metamorphis, and the planet's kept in orbit
Turntables, we spin awkward but needles never skip off it
Rhythms we expressin' similar to our ancestors
It'll answer your questions if you understand the message
From the days of the slave topics, to the new age of prophets
As heavy as hip-hop is, I'm always ready to drop it
From the mind which is one of Allah's best designs
And mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme

[Hook x2]
The 18th Letter, the prophecy professor
I stay clever, long as the planet stay together
Bring up praise from Mecca, make a phrase for the better
In new days to remember, always and forever

And judge your subjects muthafuckas read about

Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb ass hemp be
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-I-A

[Hook: Roger Troutman]
California, knows how to party
California (West Coast), knows how to party (yes, they do!)
In the city of L.A. (city of L.A)
In the city of good ol' Watts (good ol' Watts)
In the city, city of Compton (city of Compton)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreaming
Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a westside playa where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballies (that's right)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we throw grams
Worldwide let 'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sacktown, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down, give me love!

[Hook: Roger Troutman]
California, knows how to party
California, knows how to party (c'mon baby)
In the city of L.A. (South Central)
In the city of good ol' Watts (Uh, that's right)
In the city, the city of Compton

Shake it shake it mama, shake it Cali (Shake it, Cali)
Shake, shake it baby
Shake, shake it shake, shake it mama, shake it Cali (Uh, uh, West Coast)

264,New York (Ya Out There),The 18th Letter / The Book Of Life,Rakim,1996-11-04,243973,31,"

{*from the movie ""Wildstyle""*}
If you was born in New York City, let me hear say ""You know that""!
YOU KNOW THAT

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Aiyo, once upon a rhyme where the scenery sets, you see stress
Street's a matter of life and death, no regrets
Life's a test, it's trife wit' special effects
Neighbourhood's full of reps, cities are projects
Where the young cadets get stripes from the vets
And comrades quest to be the next to finesse
Collect debts and select bets with death threats
Object; cheddar, better your total net
Where trends are set from ways to express the outfits
Friends get wet tryin' to make ends connect
Avenues to check, boulevards to sweat
The smell of gunsmoke's more common than cigarettes
WE GOT cliques for wreck
WE LIKE Pits for pets
WE GOT Giants and Jets, the Knicks, Yanks and Mets
WE LIKE much respect, the sex extra wet
And high-tech dialect you ain't catch yet

(The Bronx
Ya out there?
No doubt
Brooklyn
Ya out there)

[Verse 2: Rakim]
Aiyo, we got blocks and blocks with
Big shots with big knots and big props
Yo, this is where the bullshit stops
Where herbs get got, if you snitch, you get shot
We get down and leave the town in a state of shock
WE GOT dangerous hang out spots and slick cops
Place called Rikers Island where kids get locked
A lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops
Styles are top notch, this is the place to watch
So blast the box, the radio station is hot
Ease your mind staring at skylines from rooftops
Flip scripts for chips, and new whips off the lot
Quick to call a shot, pollitic with thick plots
And the Garden of Eden against the sea that we got
To make sure the core of the Big Apple don't rot
Where seeings believing, we be achieving a lot
Where disc jocks created hip-hop, check it out!

(Queens - ya out there? no doubt
Manhattan - no doubt
New York city, Staten Island
New York, New York, Long Island
New York - ya out there?)

[Verse 3: Rakim]
Aiyo, we got five boroughs of ghettos with many places to meet
You get lost in busy streets, the city that never sleeps
Mecca, Pelan, Medina, the population increase
The desert and the oasis, New York, the far east
With Gods and sheiks, pretty Amazons for weeks
Player dons that fleece, the family's black sheep
Icons that teach but we all act unique
We got stats to reach, so we all have to eat
A mass of peeps, with they own masterpiece
The crafts' elite, we be going past the peak
The latest technique no other place get as deep
Who parks release some of the world's greatest athletes
DJ's and MC's and graffiti artistes
Who use walls and subway trains for marquees
We go back to b-boys, breakdancing, breakbeats
And it'll never cease, and on that note, we say peace

[Verse 1: Belo]
Since I'm blown let me flex this
If there's somethin on yo' mind recline and check this
So smooth not reckless
We can get high and ride from Chi to Texas
Give the game up since I came up
Blew my name up, check out the rhythm
Make them all wanna flame up
Strike a match to a lighter
A message to a young ridah, on the sight of
Pimp poetry I make you lighter than a feather in your Dobb hat
Bitchin to skins, saw that
I can tell you where the mob at
At the click, summer sunnin where the broads at
Diggin all that, smokin weed until they come and we can fall back
Shootin back for the small scratch
Trey-Fo' what you call that?
Pull up my drawers Girbauds and doze to pros got called
By the po-po, save it for the phone doe
Bond DeVille, flossin off behind the wheel it's appeal
Took a chill, but I still had to pose
And if I pause, it's because I left my car and the phone

[Hook: Johnny P]
Can you smoke and ride
With a playa, like me, and you, oh babe
Can you smoke and ride
With a playa, like me, and you

[Verse 2: AK-47]
See uhh, laid back I'mma let the proper game at two rats
In the roll like two sacks
Dub essential when my homey came up
On the same drug for layin up they holla who that
Double check, just a couple hoes
Tryin to see where my head was at
On some problem shit
Wish to be up within the party shit
With the blunts and Bacardi shit
With the way she was dressed she might as well
Had nuttin on your body bitch
Hit the red on my side cause you know how a party get
Nuttin but the proper cheese
To squeeze a little on and scoot on to proper chick
But really doe, once a man advance
And bend blocks smoke the last of these
Pimp cats done CC's
Heavy G's ninety-six flippin clips bout naturally
Bags seized through Darnell
Heavy sacks and drop-tops
Now look on your map and spot
Where we, R-I-D, E, and smoke

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Belo]
I, made my money on the DL
Closed shop in the Pontiac we bail
To the mall to ball we're all pall
Cause a brother gonna floss in front of these females
To the retail
Five double oh period double oh these suits
The Girbaud with the boots
Then I scoop, up the loot
Paid the cash and dashed past the lab or the members of
Put my foot in motion, exits the sto' with my brand new gear
Spring game in her ear
Tell her Miss to please me and dance till it'll make me hear
Get her dizzy off the Stanberg
Girlie had to run for months to pump up but I'mma handle her
Like a man, I'mma stand if I fall
And when I fall, then the city better make the call
Left the mall, by the minutes of clothes
I suppose I get dressed to impress these hoes
Getty shoe fresh Guess from head to toe
Only wearin in the do' what the playas know
Bet y'all wanna see me niggas wanna be me
Never will they pimp free, pimp costs
And I get lost on the slide for the Ave gettin high while we ride

[Hook]

[Johnny P]

[Chorus: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind

If I gots to bring it to you cowards, then it's gonna be quick (Aight)

And all them other cats you run with, get done with dumb quick
How the fuck you gon' cross the dog on some bum shit? (Aight)
There go the gun click, 911 shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit?
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club
'Cause every time you come around, it's like what?
I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin' to
But I'm not him, aight, Slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue
Or maybe they just saying that now 'cause they miss you
Shit, a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you laying on your back
Looking at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin' the truth and it hurts

[Verse 2: DMX]
Off the chain, I leave niggas soft in the brain
'Cause niggas still want the fame off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fucking with me, and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on
That got you think that you Superman, I got the Kryptonite
Should I smack him with my dick or the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? (Hmm), let's add up all the factors
You wack, you twisted, your girl's a ho
You broke, the kid ain't yours and everybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, ""So?""
""I love my baby mother, I'll never let her go""
I'm tired of weak-ass niggas whining over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it all on the strength of the hands with them, man

[Chorus: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Verse 3: DMX]
I bring down rain so heavy it hurts the head
No more talking, put him in the dirt instead
You keep walking, 'less you tryna end up red
'Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
'Cause you's a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Get pushed like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brung out
Run up in there, everybody come out, don't nobody burn out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga running his mouth, I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, your ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you? (Who?), some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

[Chorus: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Bridge: DMX]
One, two, meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my Ruff Ryders gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my big ballers gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my fly ladies gon' meet me outside

Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that
Jig it out, uh

[Verse 1]
Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me n' Charlie at the bar runnin up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like (Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin

Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with

Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'mma scoot me somethin hot
In this salsa- merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay papi!""
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An' if you ask how I know, I gots ta plead the fifth

And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand

Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand

Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach

269,Do For Love,R U Still Down? [Remember Me],2Pac,1997-01-01,281600,71,"

[Intro: 2Pac]
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, Pac!
Word up, hahahahaha

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I should've seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin' out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I’m 'bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin' low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear, 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the door
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin', I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry 'bout it, we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision, 'cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Outro: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
Do for love, yeah baby yeah
Do for love

[Verse 1]
Ah ah
Baby girl was draped in Chanel
Said she love 2Pac but hates some LL
Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings
She can take a prince, turn him into a king
I was looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites
Said her man get paper but he don't live right
All these emotions flowing inside the club
Do you really want a thug or do ya want love?
She gets the paper when it's time to get it
She keep these clowns sinkin' like Chappaquiddick
Honey smoke make you click, feel it in their throats
No joke, all these love letters they wrote
Behind every playa is a true playette
Bounce you up, outta there, push eject
Taster's choice, have you nice and moist
Or play paper games or floss the Rolls Royce

[Chorus]
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon

You was king of seduction, cop a suction
Now she with a cat that worked construction
You wanna starve her with the paper, abuse her mind
This a new lover, when you know it's on mine
That's on top, lap dancin' got to stop
You play out your chick cause your game is hot
I give you two, Italian iced my whole crew
Piece banging on my chest 'til I'm black and blue
You beefin', yellin' on the cell of my 6
You reachin', then you hear the cordless click
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'
Hell no, must be out ya mind
Got you on your knees and your elbows each and every time
That's why I love you mami, you
Run your mouth, throw your legs over the bed baby
Work me out

[Chorus]
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
(uh huh) (go ahead daddy)

[Verse 3]
You was all souped up, but played it just right
Mami I was full blown, my game was airtight
I needed to switch up and get it in gear
It's a whole new movie, a world premiere, yeah yeah
Keep it jinglin', no more minglin'
A brand new year, me and you can bring it in
I was sick and tired of the freakin', night to morn'
Bonin' in the mirror with my Cubans on
Let bygones be bygones, no more games
Hope all the chickenheads go up in flames
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back
Got it all figured out, mami I like that
Collect tips, cop his and her whips
To waste a quarter mil on clothes is sick
But you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field
Say what you want, but keep your lips sealed

[Chorus]
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
(uh huh) (go ahead daddy)

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
I make a million bucks every six months and y'all
Hating my game, saying my name, they call
Me the E, wrong things, knowing I'm fly without wings
While some of y'all have to pull strings
In this era, I maintain the freak upon the beat
Master basslines of Raphael Saadiq
Lyrical mastermind, a genius so don't snooze
No mission's impossible, ask Tom Cruise
I keep a joint lit when I have to spit
A rough paragraph, laugh, when I'm bustin' your ass
Who want it? Come and see me, like 112
And I'll rock that bell with Fox and L
E-Dub, Mr Excitement, right
The poltergeist of rap so come to the light
Yes, the recipient of this award goes to moi
The best qualified superstar

Niggas killin' shit tryin' to duplicate the manuscripts
That's impossible, pray like the gospel
Overcoming setbacks and jumping over obstacles
Like Evel Knievel, on point like a needle
EPMD's like the Beatles, back with another sequel
To hip-hop, check one two and you don't stop
Rap with mainstream R&B and pop
Now the world's shocked, the E-double's back with Mic-Doc
Like it or not, we ’bout to turn it up another notch
Mach speed, put it down for my seeds
Raw breeds, acres with the deeds, it's the joint

You wanna ride? Call me up when you're lonely

When the rain hits my window
I take and *cough* me some indo
Me and Timbaland, ooh, we sang a jangle
We so tight that you get our styles tangled
Sway on dosie-do like you loco
Can we get kinky tonight?
Like Coko, so-so
You don't wanna play with my Yo-Yo
I smoke my hydro on the D-low (D-D-D-D-D-low)

To have me, (I can't stand the rain), yes, you lucky (against my window)

It's the MiBs, uhh, here come the MiBs
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
They won't let you remember
Nah nah nah

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
The good guys dress in black remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me: MiB
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there is now gone
Black suit with the black RayBans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back
'Cause you never quite know where the MiBs is at
Uh and

[Chorus: Coko]
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
Galaxy defenders (oooh, oooh, oooh)
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
They won't let you remember (won't let you remember)

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
Uh uh, uh uh, now
From the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon bright light enters sight, tight
Cameras zoom on the impendin' doom
But then like *BOOM* black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralyzer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no MiBs, can I please
Do what we say that's the way we kick it
Yaknahmean? I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless
MiBs, freezin' up all the flack
(What's that stand for?) Men in Black

[Bridge: Will Smith & Coko]
Uh, and
The Men in Black
Uh, and
The Men in Black
Let me see ya just bounce it with me, just bounce with me (bounce with me)
Just bounce it with me c'mon
Let me see ya just slide with me, just slide with me (slide, slide, slide, slide)
Just slide with me c'mon
Let me see ya take a walk with me, just walk it with me (walk with me)
Take a walk with me c'mon
And make your neck work
Now freeze (uh huh huh ha)

Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
Galaxy defenders (oooh, oooh, oooh)
Here come the Men in Black (Men in Black)
They won't let you remember (no, no)

[Verse 3: Will Smith]
Alright check it, let me tell you this in closin'
I know we might seem imposin'
But trust me if we ever show in your section
Believe me, it's for your own protection
'Cause we see things that you need not see
And we be places that you need not be
So go witcha life, forget that Roswell crap
Show love to the black suit, 'cause that's the Men in
That's the Men in

It's Wu motherfuckers, a Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu motherfuckers, a Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu

[Verse 1: GZA]
Reunited, double LP, world excited
Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style deteriorate rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwing your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up if you mastered addition
Where I come from, getting visuals is habitual
You're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, formed a mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it was plural
Rhyming while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparalleled advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage

[Verse 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk
I smoke the bead of the skunk, tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk, your head get shrunk
Your treasure sunk, I be fucking bitches by the chunk
My name black, you worms wanna play in my dirt
Bitch stop, my Momma serve free lunch from the church
I cum like a thousand doves
Bitch you quiet at the bus, making no fuss, I got self love
Unglove the noose, watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze
I don't walk, I get carried
Gold and platinum Frisbees on my wall, looking properly
But comely, I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers
The Indian that sold Manhattan to the white man
My grandfather, step up and get knocked right the fuck out
Come to the cook-out, dirty bitch at the mouth
You scared, run around like the plane about to crash

[Break: Ms. Roxy]
Wu-Tang motherfuckers
Wu-Tang motherfuckers
Yeah and RZA

[Verse 3: RZA]
Yo, yo The Riddler, funny bone tickler, freak Caligula
Bigger dick sex enigma, pistil fertilize your stigma
Stinkbox order from Pink Dot
MCs get stuck on ink blots, AirSound plug to the sinkbox
Wu-Tang Incorp. take your brain on spacewarp
Talk strange like Björk, great hero Jim Thorpe
How can I put it, life is like video footage
Hard to edit, directors, that never understood it
Too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage
Attack when you least notice through explosive postage
I don't play, the rap souffle sauté for the day
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A Leg Leg Arm Head
Spread like plague, we drink Hennessy by the keg
I got the golden egg plus the goose
Eighty proof Absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice
Ginseng root, I got your neck in a noose
Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
Sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than Kinko
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
And we return like Jesus when the whole world need us

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Is it appetite for destruction?
Slap a murder rap on this production
I touch something, trust nothing
Iron Lung/Twisted Metal
I see 'em ducking my dart gun, busting from every angle
Worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow
That be codenamed Agent Orange, killing you slow
It's only right you pay homage
To those that's 'bout to blow like that shit up your nose
Solid as a rock when I strike target
Verbal be screaming on you like a drill sergeant
Herbals got me where I wanna be right now
Don't know the time
Check the hour on your sundial, watch me shine
Drunk off of cheap wine
Each line be on point when I speak mine
On behalf of my crew, SUUUUUUUUUUU, Enter the Wu
36 more deadly Chambers to take you through

It's Wu motherfuckers

It's Wu motherfuckers

Artist: Heavy D
Album: Waterbed Hev
Song: Big Daddy

What's the deal
I wanna know is this love for real
Or could it be lust that I feel
You got it going on and on like a real fly sex appeal
Physique extra ill sun sweet dress to kill
You got me open like token hot and smokin
Jacuzzi bubble bath laughin joking
Candle light talking about how you and your ex-man fight
Tropical sight beach sand white listen
Seafood dishes wine cooler champagne wishes waterbed head
Fine do with some riches
Our loveable hugeable I love the cute
As long as I'm around and down nothin could ever trouble you

Chorus:

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy

..... I spend quality time
Cute face haircut like the Hally design
Keep my day laced up with fly gear and makeup
But you should see her when she wake up never could we brake up
Shop till you drop cause the cream dont stop
Buy you a bunch of outfits your sexy your hot
So she could look good for Hev D
Overweight loving MC rub you gently
You know its C big CEO sex-o-pee
Mac game similar next to gold and flex
You might feelme creeping to your room late at night
It's hell a waterbed so get it right
You be like that its that big man we all up tonight
Game ear tight why you caught up in the hype
That's right that's miggie, miggie, biggie
Baby your ready for big daddy

Chorus

You on my mind like all the time
You genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign
Boo be all that and then some
Job all that mad income
Hand New Yorkers wish you represent from
24-7 you the one that I be sweating
You and time that's no question couldn't be nothin less than
Sexually the best next to me I confess
You got me hooked on like Phonics or weed heads on Chronic
Now sit your ready you give me more like Demi good and plenty
Nothin could compare to you Boo I swear to you
I feel for you for real for you
All I wanna do is be with you
Might even steal for you
You walk like talk like sexy
When you kiss me you bless me undress me caress me
You on my mind like all the time
You genuine and you fine missing you like dollar sign

Blaze the hot trizack that sound like Heaven
Seven, six, five, four to three, two, one
Mo'mon, Meth-Tical, come and get some

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Playing my position, hot Nick, son
This one, for all the sick ones, infliction
Poisonous darts sickenin', best believe
Finger itchin' with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'
On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble, bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D, no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
Tap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sonning you
Got you shittin' in your last Huggie, running who?
Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump coming through
A single shot make yo' meat lump, respect Wu

[Verse 2: Redman & Method Man]
Yo, ayo, I put it on a nigga, shitted on a nigga
Turn a Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (Explode)
When you got sent up I was hitting your ex ho
Shit, I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin'
Shit I'm driving in come with fog halogen
Terrorize your city from the spliff committee
Kick ass 'til both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the gypsy
When I approach, rappers be taking notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots
I keep cummin' 'til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you, ""Fuck you"", my attitude is anaemic

[Verse 3: Canibus]
I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown with ya head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I'll start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?""
I could go on for more Millenniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run to, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like it had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild?
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surface-to-air missile?
I take 'em on in all shapes, sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred when I'm blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it

[Verse 4: DMX]
Stay out the dark, 'cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
Run it now, however it's gon' go, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you, dog, believe that
Where we at? Do you value your life as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock 'cause it's better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick, you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it, baby
You's a big nigga, ski mask for it, baby
So I can hit you up on Front Street, you think I'm sweet
Want heat, one deep, leave him behind, front seat

[Chorus 2: Redman & Method Man]
Ayo, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Blaze the hot trizack, shine like Heaven
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Come on, Mr. Smith, come get some (Some, some, some)

[Verse 5: LL Cool J]
When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (Ha, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords, I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension (Uh-huh)
Your little ass should be somewhere crying on detention
Watch your mouth, better yet, hold your tongue (Uh)
I'ma do this shit for free this time, this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (LL Cool J is hard)
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like picking up a ball, playing with Mike (Uh-huh)
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to a fight (Uh)
Snapping, you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team touring overseas?
For rappers in my circle, I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringing a tiger cub to his knees (Uh)
In the history of rap, they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (Word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side, it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad, nigga, you wanna socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name (LL)
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth, don't ever step out of line
LL Cool J, nigga, greatest of all time

There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future
But through whatever you see
Through all the rain and the pain
You gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that!
Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! Yeah

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!

[Hook: Johnny P & (2Pac)]
Smile for me, won't you smile? (Smile for me now)
Just smile, smile for me (Smile)
(What you lookin' all sad for?
Nigga, you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me
(Nigga, you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile? (No doubt, smile for me now)
Just smile (And the next generation)

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!

[Hook: Johnny P]
Smile for me, won't you smile?
Just smile, smile for me
Smile for me
Won't you smile? Just smile

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Fuck the world, as we unloading, witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhale the sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us all, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is ""Fuck friends!"" – we military minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga

[Bridge: Scarface]
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

[Hook: Johnny P]
Smile, smile for me
All you need to do is smile
Woooo smile for me
Come on, smile for me

People would stop and stare when we walked in
We would give the doorman a hundred dollars
Just for openin' the door
Sosa would give the bartender two hundred dollars
Just for keepin' the ice cold
Yeah, we were legends
Yeah, and we still are legends

[Verse 1: AZ]
Two hundred fallen angels, we ballin' from every angle
Heavy bag gold, Panamanian chains dangle, let’s tangle
Tabernacles, Elohim’s comin' at you
Fuck parables, a billion years B.C., original black Jews
Cashews honey nut roasted, let’s kill the culprit
He owe shit, toe-to-toe or let .44 spit
Fuck the whole shit, mercury back-tax the birth of me
Personally, I existed when Earth was in need, indeed
Human life form transformed from light storms
Protons, electrons, neutrons, I swarm
Nights long, reptilians, I’ll see y'all in the next millennium
What world are we really in?
Amphibians moved to the Caribbeans
Underwater force, placed under the court of law
Usually sport velour, my mind stay core raw
Fill of ambience, love fine fabrics and cars to launch
Nonchalant, usually there are jimmies up in The Bronx
Play low style, through the years, changed my whole profile
Let the doe pile, bet the God be around for a while
Firm Islamic, hit the core of the Earth just like a comet

[Intro 2: AZ]
See, I liked Esco
He knew everybody and everybody knew him
He was the type of guy that rooted for the bad guys in the movies
But, hey

[Verse 2: Nas]
Die for this Firm, live for this Firm, niggas learn
Nothin' should come before your fam, from keys to quarter grams
D’s on corners in the blue van ease upon us
'Cause of warrants, while we smoke hashish enormous
Stack cheese, travel the world like tourists
Went half with Sosa for four bricks
Down in Camden, we handlin’ to D.C
Chicks on flights with China Whites by they tight P.P
Wantin' PC, but all they get is good dick
Or full clips for loose lips by this young ruthless
Suck the pearl tongue juices off your fly missus
Take her out to the Spark’s Steakhouse
Gentleman style, coincidental
Family’s here, meet femme fatale
French connection, Persian wet don, let’s get this ep. on
The Ebony queen, Fox, you grab my left arm
Dre made it QB to Compton, BK and so on
Family strong, consigliere Nature
Makin' sure we all get this millionaire paper
What a sweet sight for sour eyes, may we all rise
Hope from now on, we never cross sides

[Intro 3: Foxy Brown]
You know what?
Most hoes would’ve left these cats a long time ago
I mean, if your man gave you a gun to hide
What would y'all hoes do?
But you know, the shit kinda turned me on

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
Black Madonna, hoes kill for they papos
Ever seen a bitch like this? Queen missus
Rocks the VVS's on the left wrist
Trick, check this, respect this
Firm niggas lie knee-deep in this bitch
When you need, bitch’ll have my pussy bleed
Swear for ‘em, fuck and take the chair for ‘em
Whoever dare cross us, distort the thoughts across a bitch mind
Pops the nine, leave 'em restin’ in pieces
All my thorough bitches, peep this: Death before dishonor
School me on the dick game, lace me in Gabbana
Peep dat, think I’m flippin’ on these three cats?
Set yo' clown ass right up with my down ass
Bitch to hold the cash and G’s
Stash the guns for ‘em in the icy E-bikini
Breed a son for ‘em
Long dick style, swallow the enemy’s cum for 'em
Pretty-ass ho, bitch'll fuck 'em and I dumb on 'em
When Nas pops the Crist', Fox cocks the fifth
Make my doe off of Oz’s and hoes that strip, uh

[Intro: Mase]
This Mase, you know what I'm saying
You got niggas that don't like me for whatever reason
You got niggas that don't wanna see me rich
You got niggas that's mad cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggas that just don't like me
You know the, those PHD niggas
But you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though
See it's a difference
A lot of niggas pop shit
But a lot of niggas don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit
We come to bring it to y'all niggas, me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever, Black Rob
If you wanna dance, we dance

[Verse 1: Mase]
Now trick what, lace who, that ain't what Mase do
Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face boo not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny never find that, Puff a dime stack
Write hot shit and make a nigga say, rewind that
Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo
Getcha ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door
I represent honeys with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says okay my tint smoke gray
No way, nigga leave without handing me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my six
Niggas outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
I was in one bedroom, dreaming of a million
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling
I was a gentleman living in tenements
Now I'm swimming in all the women that be tens
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins
Hoes of all complexions
I like cinnamon
Mase you got some hoes well nigga send em in
What you waiting for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz...)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way
It's hot and hazy, never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there, girlfriend, I'm ticklish
And I be switching ve's with a wrist full of G's
Nigga please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

[Verse 3: Puff Daddy]
Now Puff rule the world even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies cum
Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks
I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I
Rock tons of gold, nuff money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

Bag with a lot-a, stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig

[Verse 2]
What?
You want to ball with the kid?
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all
Ya don't stop in the winter or the (Summertime)

[Verse 3]
Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?
Don't be silly
Gettin' jiggy wit it

281,Triumph (feat. Cappadonna),Wu-Tang Forever,Wu-Tang Clan,1997-06-03,338186,61,"

[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
What? Y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me?
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This like, this '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight, incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, diehard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block

[Verse 2: Method Man]
As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan
Into the fire, transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back? In the line of fire, holding back
What? My peoples; if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot, and blow spots
You wanna think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary 'Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover, kid, what? Run for your brother, kid
Run for your team and your ""six can't rhyme"" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme
Your thought is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts, paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
I got the fashion catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God

[Interlude: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

[Verse 4: U-God]
Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape Hell, globe spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky Golden Arms
Tunes spit the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fake false step make the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings

[Verse 5: RZA]
March of the wooden soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand bold like flare
Escape from your dragon's lair
In particular, my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine to the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like I'm fucking ducking five-year probation

[Verse 6: GZA]
War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for the acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn'
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

[Verse 7: Masta Killa]
The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none

[Verse 8: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, fuck that!
Look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend
Bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cork-pop convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali, came in threes
We like the Genovese, sazon season these degrees
It's Earth, 93 million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
A-yo, that's amazing
Gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer, Blue-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor, word tranquilizer
Adjust the dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat, God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made 'em jump like Rod Strickland

282,C U When U Get There,My Soul,Coolio,1997-08-26,311040,51,"

[Verse 1: Coolio]
Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinkin'
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin' and smokin'
Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy? 'Cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
Cause my crew is rollin hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no mo'
Uh, I guess that's just the way it go
I ain't tryin' to preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there

[Chorus]
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

[Verse 2: Leek Ratt]
More temptation than faith, I guess we livin for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught slippin when they come and do all the gettin
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta later start
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'mma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there waitin with the sounds bumpin

[Chorus]
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

[Verse 3: P.S. Pookie]
You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryina stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if you're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side

[Chorus]
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

[Outro: Coolio]
As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

[Produced by Dr. Dre and Chris ""The Glove"" Taylor]

[Intro: Nas]
Yo, this Esco, who this?

[Verse 1: AZ]
What's the deal-y? I just touched grounds down in Philly
Brought a pound with me, Feds floatin' around silly
Tryna find Lynn; bitch supposed to be in the Benz
Parked in row 10, her and that slow hoe Gwen
Should've known she was a bitch that we both could've boned
If posted alone, the ass had us both in the zone
But you know the rules, both been schooled by older dudes
I know the jewels, no time for them thoughts, too much to lose
Just tryna vibe until them hoes roll with the ride
Where's your joy and pride? You know, little Des' got your eyes

[Verse 2: Nas]
In the cut, drop CLK, the top's up
Left the mall, bought Little Amal the toy truck
Your boy's, what? Three-years-old now, correct?
He and my daughter age neck-and-neck, they future's set
Trees got me wet, in the background's an old cassette
Fly Stephanie Mills shit
What's the deal with all this shit I'm hearin' up top?
You got arrested, shot a fair one with a cop?
That ain't ya stee', you usually low-key when O.T
I'm only goin' off of what some weak bitch told me

[AZ]
That's some ill shit, here that bitch go with her clique

[Nas]
Yo, dunn, I'll hit you right back 'cause the static is thick

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do?
'Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, then you through
We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do?
'Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, we got you

[Verse 3: AZ]
We just hit the crib-o, I'm curled up on this pillow
I'm still low, heard the ill news, these niggas killed Mo
The shit touched me, tryna chill, just lit a Dutchie
From a while back, same foul cats who tried to bust me
Caught 'em sleepin' in Spanish Harlem with some Puerto Ricans
Up in Washington Heights, right off the Deegan
Feel awful speakin', for some reason feel the phone's tapped
Alone with gats, left with a vest to watch my own back

[Verse 4: Nas]
Keep your eyes open, stay wise, shit is mind-blowin'
Look for any sign showin' one-time is knowin'
About the dynasty, shit is not minor leagues no more
Cats bleed in this cold war
Son, we took a oath, then this life took us both
We rich now, milked the whole cow, split the growth
Now I'm on the Conduit, headlights on
Fluid in the windshield, wipes on
This light storm that's formin' in the sky
You comin' home tomorrow? Will you drive or will you fly?
Hold up, my other side

[Nature]
Yo, son, some other cats tried to ruin our plans
Sendin' two decoy bitches with pictures of you and your man
Askin' your whereabouts, I gave 'em no leads
For all a nigga know, them hoes fuck with police

[Nas]
No shit, I'm clickin' over, I'mma tell Sos quick
Son, them outta state bitches tryna get us both hit
That was Nate, he hit me last night late while in my ho's stomach
Said it's no runnin', we FBI's Most Wanted
So play the low; change your clothes, pack your bags
Watch what you say on this phone, get home fast

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do?
'Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, then you through
We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do/
'Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, we got you

284,Gone Till November,Wyclef Jean presents The Carnival featuring Refugee Allstars (feat. Refugee All Stars),Wyclef Jean,1997-06-24,207466,49,"

[Intro]
I dedicate this record, The Carnival, to all you brothers takin' long trips down south, Virginia, Baltimore, all around the world, and your girl gets this message that you ain't comin' back. She's sittin' back in the room, the lights are off, she's cryin', and then my voice comes in, POW!, in the middle of the night, and this is what I told her for you

[Chorus]
Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother

[Verse 1]
When I come back, there'll be no need to clock
I'll have enough money to buy out blocks
Tell my brother, ""Go to school in September""
So he won't mess up in summer school in the summer
Tell my cousin, Jerry, wear his condom
If you don't wear condom, you'll see a red lump
Woh oh oh oh
You sucker MC's, you got no flow
I heard your style, you're s-o s-o

[Chorus]
Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother

[Verse 2]
I had to flip nuttin' and turn it into somethin'
Hip-hop turns to the future rock when I smash a pumpkin
Commit treason, then I'll have a reason to hunt you down
It's only right, it's rappin' season
Yeah, you with the loud voice, posin' like you're top choice
Your voice, I'll make a hearse out of your Rolls Royce
Besides, I got my girl to remember
And I'll commit it that I'll be back in November

[Chorus]
Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother

I know the hustle's hard, but we gotta enterprise, the carnival

285,Candy,Phenomenon,LL Cool J,1997-01-01,272360,31,"

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
When you was seventeen and I was nineteen
We feel deep in love growing up in Queens
We didn't know a thing about love
We was innocent sneakin' on the doorstep to hug
Held you tightly and promised you the world
You gave me hickys and said you was my girl
When I think about it now makes me smile
Cause I ain't felt these butterflies in a while
Funny how you grow up and innocence fades
We used to live for love but now we're afraid (of what?)
Of the darkness and bitter memories
Lovers who crushed us through infidelity
I promised you I'd love you to the end
Always and forever since way back when
You're like candy the world's sweetest friend
You taste better now than you did back then

[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]
You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(you'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl understand me
You will always be my candy girl

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
While you sucked caramel apple lolly pops
Rain sleet or snow I'm troopin' up the murdock
We used to walk down the block hold hands
I would get you after school cause I was your man
And any guys that wanna socalize
Just know that I'm a flip on any cat that trys
My peeps used to say I was whipped
All your girls said since you got with him you flipped
But uh they couldn't feel the feelings we felt
Mirrors on the ceiling we melt
I would look up at ya I remember
The afternoon you surrendered
We made love the tempature was high as could be
You said Todd promise you ain't liein' to me
And as we went our seperate ways you turned back
Smiled I remember all that

[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]
You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(you'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl understand me
You will always be my candy girl

[Bridge: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]
Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
Candy girl
All I want to say
I need your love
Each and every day

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my memories call
Of days when love was true I slept and held you
Taste the brown sugar let your climax melt yo
Candy you're occupying all of my thoughts
Turned my soul upside down with lessons you taught
I can feel you even when you're far away you're right here wit' me
Sweet love strictly
And I'm a bend over backwards to keep you on my side
Take you for a mental and emotional ride
Make love to your soul your heart and your mind
In your hour of need girl I'll be there every time
And as long as you support my dreams
Stayin' right beside me as a part of my team
I'll take you where the average man can only dream of
Cause in a world so sour I got the sweetest love

[Chorus: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]
You will always be my candy
One day we will start a family
You will always be my candy girl
(you'll be my candy girl forever)
You will always be my candy
Want your love girl understand me
You will always be my candy girl

[Outro: Ralph Tresvant & Ricky Bell]
Candy girl
You are my world
Look so sweet
You're a special treat
(you'll be my candy girl forever)
Candy girl
All I want to say
(word is bond sweetheart)
I need your love
(I swear I'm down for whatever)
Candy girl
(sometimes you gotta go back home)
Look so sweet
(I love you)
Candy girl

Bad Boy... we ain't gon' stop

Now with Sean on the hot track, melt like it's hot wax
Put it out, all the stores, bet you could shop that (that's right)
Leave a nigga with a hot hat
Fronting like Bad Boy ain't got tracks (nigga stop that)

There's no guy slicker than this young fly nigga
Nickel-nine nigga, floss you die quicker (uh-huh)
This fed time outta town pie flipper
Turn Cristal into a Crooked I sipper

Everbody want to be fast, see the cash
Fuck around they weak staff, get a heat rash
Anything in Bad Boy way we smash (we smash)
Hundred G stash, push a bulletproof E-Class (ehehe)

I'm through with bein' a player and a baller
Just want me one bad bitch so I can spoil her
Mase wanna be the one you respect, even when you're vexed
Rock Versace silks over spilled v-neck

Got green never seen so you suck my jewels
Clutch my uz', anything I touch I bruise
Puff make his own laws, nigga fuck your rules (that's right)
Goodfellas, you know you can't touch us dudes

Don't push us, 'cause we're close to the edge
We're tryin, not to lose our heads, a-hah hah hah hah

Broken glass everywhere
If it ain't about the money, Puff, I just don't care (that's right)
I'm that Goodfella fly guy, sometimes wiseguys
Spend time in H-A-W-A-I-I

(Mase can you please stop smoking lah lah?)
Puff why try? I'm a thug, I'mma die high
I be out in Jersey, puffin' Hershey
Brothers ain't worthy to rock my derby

Though I'm never drugged, I'm the venom in the club, G
Though I know the thug be wantin' to slug me (uh-huh)
Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)
Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)

Yo, I think it must be the girls want to lust me
Or is it simply the girls just love me
Brothers wanna rock the Rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life

I'm like, ""Damn, how these niggas got they trust?
Used to be my man, how you gonna plot on my wife?""
Do you think you snake me, 'cause they hate me?
Or he got his Ph.D Player Hater's Degree? (haha)

Can't nobody take my pride
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't nobody hold me down, ohh no
I got to keep on movin'

Quit that! (uh-huh) You a big cat? (yeah)
Where your chicks at? (yeah) Where your whips at? (where dey at?)
Wherever you get stacks, I'mma fix that
Everything that's big dreams, I did that (that's right)

Don't knock me 'cause you're boring
I'm record sales soaring, straight touring
Simply a lot of men be wantin to hear me
'Cause their words just don't offend me (uh-uh, uh-uh)

We spend cheese in the West Indies
Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (ahehe)
You name it, I could claim it
Young, black and famous with money hangin' out the anus

And when you need a hit, who you go and get? (who?)
Bet against us? (Not a sure bet)
We make hits that'll rearrange your whole set (that's right)
And got a Benz that I ain't even drove yet

Don't push us, cause we're close to the, edge
We're tryin, not to, lose our heads, a-hah-hah-hah-hah

I get the feeling sometime, that make me wonder
Why you wanna take us under
Why you wanna take us under

I get the feeling sometime, that make me wonder
Why you wanna take us under
Why you wanna take us under

Can't nobody take my pride
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Can't nobody hold me down, ohh no
I got to keep on movin'

Can't nobody take my pride

[Verse]
Envisioning the hereafter, listening to Steve Wonder
On a quest for love like the Proceed drummer
I strike like lightning and don't need thunder
Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
That's your lady, I used to run up in her and chief weed from her
It's a cold world and niggas need summer
At times my going forward seems like retreat
As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye, seen and contagious
Redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican, hip hop is my garden
Don't give a fuck where you charting, certain shit I can't honor
It ain't that you selling, it's your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
Poetically perform live-bys, another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy
Not for the money, I could have sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key 20
Youngblood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty
Hollering at the brothers, either you gon' be a thug or a man
Flip drugs and get land
I can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him
And said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked with him
This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was coming
I said it's here, it's here...

288,Just The Two Of Us,Big Willie Style,Will Smith,1997-10-03,315506,51,"

[Intro: Trey Smith]
Now Dad this is a very sensitive subject

[Chorus]
Just the two of us
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
Just the two of us (just the two of us)

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough
Against wrong, choose right and be standing up?
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right
People driving all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
Five years old, bringin comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me, wait an' see, gonna be tall
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A general, a doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that
Uh-uh-uh why you do that?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can, show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an'
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame in it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

[Verse 3]
It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm tyin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

Major! Hell motherfuckin' yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Cooley, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellraiser

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Born thuggin'
Heartless and mean, muggin' at sixteen
On the scene watchin' fiends buggin'
Kickin' up dust with the older G's
Soakin' up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot
I learned not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes
Taught lessons, a young nigga askin' questions
While other suckers was guessin', I was gangsta sexin'
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary and cuttin' classing
I'm buckin' blastin', straight mashin'
Mobbin' through the overpass laughin'
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger on the trigger
'Cause some nigga tried to kill me
And mama raised a hellraiser, everyday gettin' paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin'
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark 'til I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin' richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin' trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein' black
Dear Lord can ya feel me? Stress gettin' major, unhh

Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major

[Ad-Lib/Collision: 2Pac]
Dear Lord can ya feel me?

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell me Lord can ya feel me? Show a sign
Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin'
Mama raised a hellraiser, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggas
I'm startin' to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies rushin' into early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin' else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
Crooked cop killin' Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin' but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggas burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin' triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin' better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin' blunts
Gettin' drunk off that Tanqueray gin
'Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin' pen'
Mama raised a hellraiser, uhh, yeah
C'mon, uhh, mama raised a hellraiser
Uhh, dear Lord can ya feel me? Stress gettin' major

Dear Lord can ya hear me? It's just me
A young nigga tryin' to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin' please come and SAVE ME
THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin' die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, aww shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high 'til they bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news how she bucked the girl, killed Latasha
Now I'm screamin' fuck the world, in the end
It's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker, I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me? When I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, thug nigga
Stressin' like a motherfuckin' drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die

[Intro]
[The announcer's voice from Playstation's NBA Live '97]
""Welcome to Inglewood, California""

Hey hey hey
What you got to say

[Verse: 1]
Fast bitches fast cars money and fame
This rap shit is just like the '90's dope game
Before sold out shows rocked and hoes jocked
It was all about the 'hood and that Foe Hundred block
A few scraps as a puppy dog
You had to be down
To roam that infamous neighborhood
Where niggas wore the crown
It was on every morning from Manchester to Century
BG's walkin' in packs to elementary
Afterschool some had 'hood patrol
And watched deals on the corner
While others had skills and hittin' drills in Pop Warner
The unforgettable good old days how it used to be
'foe niggas made the transition from a jock to a G
Now the streets is nice but the police is thick
Cause niggas sick and mo' murders
Committed than a horror flick
But whatever happen rappin' or not
It's the same for me
It's still I.N.G. foe L.I.F.E
So...

[Hook]
Hey hey heyy
What you got to say
Inglewooooood [Inglewood echoes]
Inglewood Swangin' [Inglewood echoes]

[Verse: 2]
The city's full of cheddar like a cheese pizza
Known for senoritas and Inglewood Familias
The landmarks in the 'hood is legendary
The fabulous Forum, the Court and the Library
The city hall is scandalous to the average tax payer
So the town done fucked around and voted me the mayor
Had G's that put they life on the line and some died
But thanks to this rap we on the map worldwide
And as far as race go we probably even these days
About 50% black and the rest is esays
So we spin and we win up and down Market St
Bitch I'm a million dollar nigga and still shop the Swapmeet
What I'm in right now probably ain't worth a hundred bucks
A beany T-shirt khakis and a fresh pair of Chucks
That's a real nigga foe you that's me so don't knock it
I got everything I need plus money in my pocket
So...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I.N.G. foe L.I.F.E. (4X)

[Verse: 3]
It seem like yesterday I was the average Y.G
And at the blink of a eye became a household MC
From the land of sunshine gold D's and palm trees
To Japanese screamin' for a nigga overseas
But I gotta think about O.G's I got game from
Remain the same nigga and can't forget where I came from
We all know money make the world go 'round
So I give back to my town and put a few niggas down
I keep my enemies close cause they salt shakers
Mad because I travel state to state
And get paid like the Lakers
Used to like the Magic man when I was a itty bitty
But now Mack and Shaq can go half and buy the city
So...

291,Father,Phenomenon,LL Cool J,1997-01-01,284666,28,"

[Intro]
I swear to tell the truth and nothin but the truth...
So help me God
I just felt like tellin the story of my life
Felt like, maybe somebody could be inspired, you know?
We all feel pain, we all go through things
But it's time to overcome all that

[Verse 1]
If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move
They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude
Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck
He sniffed some coke, come home
Beat up on my moms cause she's talkin on the phone
Come on

[Chorus]
(all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(all I ever needed)
All I ever needed
(was a father)
Was a father
(that's all)
That's all!
(all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(all I ever needed)
All I ever needed... was a father
(was a father)

[Verse 2]
Moms got tired of the beatings said, ""Yo, we got to go""
Packed up her bags we bounced out the do'
She said, ""I ain't takin these whippin's no mo'
I wanna live to see my little Todd grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Lookin down at me standin on the staircase
Handsome brother with a smooth goatee
Makes me wonder why he act so ugly, you feelin me?
(I'm feelin you)

[Chorus]
(all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(all I ever needed)
All I ever needed
(was a father)
Was a father
(that's all)
That's all!
(all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(all I ever needed)
All I ever needed... was a father
(was a father)

[Verse 3]
My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dan', sniffed up a ounce
Grabbed the shotty left Long Isle for Queens
Possesed by a demon... a devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risk
When your moms come home off the midnight shift
She turned around heard the shotgun click
My pops said, ""You think that you could leave me {bitch}?""
He blasted my moms in the back
She fell down screamin I can't forget that
My grandfather tried to close the do'
He got shot ten times in the stomach yo, for real

[Chorus]
(all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(all I ever needed)
All I ever needed
(was a father)
Was a father
(that's all)
That's all!
(all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(all I ever needed)
All I ever needed... was a father
(was a father)

[Verse 4]
My head was spinnin, I had never seen blood
Four years old, this don't feel like love
Anyway, pops dissapeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe without him she'd be dead
You know, they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed right that's word to mother
Until I started gettin beatings everday
Sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees I'd pray
A young child, wishin the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat with belts like a slave with a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest stomped me out on the flo'
That's just the tip of the iceberg look
It's too long for a song but perfect for a book
Word is bond, that's real baby

[Chorus]
(all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(all I ever needed)
All I ever needed
(was a father)
Was a father
(that's all)
That's all!
(all I ever wanted)
All I ever wanted
(all I ever needed)
All I ever needed... was a father

This is for the Bourbons and the Cadillacs
With the tens and the twelves bumpin' in the back
This is for the players, hustlas, pimps, and macks
With the Benz, makin' ends, I mean them paper stacks
This is for the Bourbons and the Cadillacs
With the tens and the twelves bumpin' in the back
This is for the players smokin' doolamac
Slappin' skins, makin' dividends and riding strapped

[Master P]
(Uhhhhhh) wood grain with the leather seats
Windows so dark you need a flashlight to see me
Smokin' on that doja
Four niggas in the back screamin', ""No Limit soldiers!""
True to the gizzame
Stopped in the projects, sold a half an ounce of cocaine
Hit interstate ten, to Texas
Listening to DJ Screw, just raced a Lexus
Called up Pimp C
Did a song last week with my nigga Bun B
Twistin' on some green spinach
And niggas still trippin', I ain't dead, I'm still in it

[Mo B. Dick]
This is for the Bourbons and the Cadillacs

This is for the players, hustlas, pimps, and macks
With the Benz, makin' ends and them paper stacks

[Silkk the Shocker]
See pockets full of dollars already stacked
So I'm gangsta leaning sideways
Today ain't Friday
Ten it is and today is my day
Take it from mister hundred spoke rider
Cadillac Suburban driver, pussy diver
Push the Glock inside when I'm ridin'
Flossin' down the block
Holla at my boys up in the third
Got the latest word, swerve
To the side of the curb
A fiend that wanted me to serve him
I said, ""Bitch, can't tell I'm off?""
But I still gave him five dollars to wipe my white walls
And then I burst up out the block
Dropped the top 'cause it was hot
Hit the spot with the most hoes
At the sideshow, abouts to plot
Hittin' donuts, you know I’m actin', a straight-up menace
Catch me spinnin', you can tell I was there
'Cause there was a cloud of smoke when I was finished
I seen 5-0, and man he tried to sweat me
Thinkin' he'd be nice and all 'cause I gotta 185
In the hood and you know they can't catch me
And if you see me chilling you can stop me
But I keep that Glock 40 up on the dashboard
You never know who might try me
This is for the playas

[Mo B. Dick]
Playa, play on
I can't hate you homie
Playa, play on
I can't hate you homie

[Lil' Gotti Gambino]
Bourbons and 'Lacs, mansions and bitches, money and weed
A made life is all I dream
Paper chasin' for that green
I'm thuggin' on the scene, nigga
Whatcha don't believe? Well check the credents, they'll tell ya
A nigga's livin' presidential
I'm on the level that you bustas will never feel
My daughter thought I'd get caught up in the game and get killed
But reverse that shit and hit the studio and make a mil
For real, I'm slangin' platinum shit until I'm old and ill
Lil' Gotti, I'm gonna make you feel what I say, I got time to parlay
Chill off in the bay, smoke some hay
I wouldn't have that shit no other way
The made life, the game tight
No Limit for life

It's all about the Benjamins
(It's all about the Benjamins, baby)
It's all about the Benjamins
(It's all about the Benjamins, baby)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Now, what y'all wanna do?
Wanna be ballers, shot callers, brawlers
Who be dippin' in the Benz with the spoilers
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus
Tryin' to get my hands on some Grants like Horace
Yeah, livin' the raw deal
Three course meals: spaghetti, fettuccine, and vеal
But still, everything's real in thе field
And what you can't have now, leave in your will
But don't knock me for tryin' to bury
Seven zeroes over in Rio de Janeir-y
Ain't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard
On your Hot 9-7 every day, that's my word
Swimmin' in women with they own condominiums
Five plus five's, who drive Millenniums
It's all about the Benjamins, what
I get a fifty pound bag of Euk for the mutts
Five carats on my hands with the cuts
In somethin' European chromed out with the clutch, what

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I wanna hold figures, fuck bein' a broke nigga
Drinkin' malt liquor, drivin' a broke Viga
I'm with Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers
Rocking Girbaud denims with gold zippers
Lost your touch, we kept ours, poppin' Cristals
Freakin' the three-quarter reptiles
Enormous cream, forest green Benz Jeep
For my team so while you sleep I'ma scheme
We see through, that's why nobody never gon' believe you
You should do what we do, stack chips like Hebrews
Don't let the melody intrigue you, 'cause I leave you
I'm only here for that green paper with the eagle

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch & FuzzBubble, Rob Zombie, Tommy Stinson]
I'm strictly tryin' to cop those colossal-sized Picassos
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's (Woo)
(It's all about the Benjamins)
Tienda, with cash flowin' like Sosa
And a Latin chick transportin' in her chocha
Stampedin' over, pop Mo's, never sober
Flexin' Range Rovers dealin' weight by Minnesota
Avoidin' NARCs with camcorders and Chevy Novas
Stash in the building with this chick named Wilona
From Daytona, when I was young, I wanted to bone her
But now I only hit chicks who win beauty pageants
Trickin' and takin' me skiin' at the Aspens, ugh
Gangsta mental, stay poppin' Cristal
Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown (Woo)
Pinky-ringin', gondolas with the man singin'
Italian music down the river with your chick clingin'
To my bizzalls, player, you mad false
Actin' hard when you as pussy as RuPaul's

[Chorus: Puff Daddy & FuzzBubble, Rob Zombie, Tommy Stinson]
Come on, come on, uh-huh
It's all about the Benjamins, hey

Uh, uh, what the bloodclaat (Yeah, yeah)
Wanna bumble with the Bee, huh? (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Bzzz, throw a hex on the whole family (Uh-huh)
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Have your friends singin', ""This is for my homie"" (That's right)
And you know me from makin' niggas so sick
Floss in my 6, with the 'lex on the wrist
If it's murder, you know she wrote it (Uh-huh)
German Ruger for yo' ass, bitch, deep throat it (Come on)
Know you wanna feel the womb 'cause it's platinum-coated
Take your pick, got a firearm you shoulda toted, suck a dick
All that bullshit you kick, player-hatin' from the sideline
Get your own shit — why you ridin' mine?
I'm a Goodfella kinda lady
Stash .380s in Mercedes — Puffy, hold me down, baby
Only female in my crew and I kick shit like a nigga do
Pull the trigger too, fuck you

[Verse 5: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I been had skills, Cristal spills
Hide bills in Brazil, about a mill', the ice grill
Make it hard to figure me, liquor be kickin' me
In my asshole, undercover, Donnie Brasco
Left my East Coast girl the Bentley to twirl (Uh-huh)
My West Coast shorty push the chrome 740
Rockin' Redman and Naughty — oh, where my kitty cat?
Half a brick of yay in the bra where her titties at
And I'm livin' that whole life, we push weight
Fuck the state pen, fuck hoes in Penn State
Listen close, it's Francis, the Praying Mantis
Attack with the MAC, my left hand spit
Right hand grip on the whip for the smooth getaway
Playa haters, get away or my lead will spray
Squeeze off 'til I'm empty, don't tempt me
Only to Hell I send thee, all about the Benjis, what?

Its on and once again I come to you wit rough shit
Game to bust shit when mutha fuckers wanna fuck wit
The mastermind will bring it once I seen it in light
Awaken by the sounds of niggas screamin' at night
Cover your eyes I leave you face to face with your maker
The time taker intend your mind so now I break ya
No runnin' from it you should've ran before I done it
Cause now I got this loaded twelve gage against your stomach
You scarred for life and your whole high life's invited
Burned alive it's all for real so tonight I ignite
And leave you all face down to die
With no will to live I can see the fear in your eyes
No warning surprise nigga I come for taking
Your soul for satan watching' every move that your making
Your sure mistaken if you a ho before I turn out
Walking away I'll heat you up and leave you burnt out-nigga
I'm hard to kill cause I refuse to die
And can't no man born of woman alive kill me
I'm untouchable
Un-touch a-ble out here baby
(I'm untouchable)
Un-touch a-ble out here baby
(I'm unfuckable)
Un-touch a-ble out here baby
Un-touch a-ble out here baby
It's danger I'm standin' in the footsteps of danger
Wit a loaded mac 11 stripped wit rips in the chamber
The anger I aim the barrel of the hanger
Deep into the mind of this mutha fuckin stranger
I change ya outlook on living and I leave ya
Frozen starin' into space shakin' seizuring
I told ya the southside niggas roll deep
I showed ya the northside niggas don't sleep
Ya beat I'm coming down shootin up your section
You are now witnessing the gangster shit pure perfection
I'm old school o.g. niggas know me
From slanging' eightballs uncooked to moving whole keys
Now why these niggas wanna test my skills
I'm a killa and I chastise steel
To mix and mingle with this millionaire status
And send a mutha fucker to hell when he fuck with brad-it's
The killer instinct that never left me
The southside still true to the game little lefty is back
Wit shit that mutha fuckers can't fade
Rhyming but still you mutha fuckers ain't paid
So how can one try to see the unseen
Before you step your ass to the square know one thing
It's closed curtain we leavin' mutha fuckers hurtin'
It's rap-a-lot mafia life we all workin'
Punk we shut you down before you get it started
You can hate it but I'm goin' get mines and that's regardless- bitch
I got these niggas boo-hooin' like hoes
Jealous of the game I obtain and I chose
To exercise to the best of my ability
It ain't no mutha fuckin' kill me
I'm untouchable
Un-touch a-ble out here baby
(I'm untouchable)
Un-touch a-ble out here baby
Un-touch a-ble out here baby

295,I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto,R U Still Down? [Remember Me],2Pac,1997-01-01,259720,41,"

[Chorus]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 1]
I was raised, a little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, ‘cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
‘Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Chorus]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 2]
Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, Latasha, and many more
It's been going on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, ""When will the violence cease?""
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough, time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Fuck the guard, ‘cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them ‘cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down, huh
And now Bush can't stop the hit
I predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the hood being around the niggas
Yeah, and for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Hook]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Yeah, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 3]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a black President
Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself:
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
Rather be a dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Chorus]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
(Soulja in the house)
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Yeah, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Verse One:

Saturday morning at the crack of sunrise
Thank the man upstairs for lettin' me open my eyes
It's a whole new game for me like T-Lee
It's nine-seven now and I'ma stay sucka free
Thinkin' about all my homeboys behind bars
As I crease up my khakis and lace up my stars
And everythang is straight I'm in the full zone
Gettin' paper every day, it's all I'm trippin' on
'Cause ain't nothin' like a rag in Californ-i-a
With the top back, rollin' on a hot sunny day
It's one-oh, fo'-sho', and I'm clownin' all the rookies
With a pocket full of cookies
And mashi'n to the backyard boogie

[Ice Cube]
Get yo' boogie on [repeat 3X]

Chorus:

And then we comin' wit that
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (yeah)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's all about that)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (unh)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's the backyard boogie) [repeat 3X]
Backyard boogie oogie oogie [repeat 2X]

Verse Two:
Now just throw yo hands up high in the sky
Representin' where you from cause it's West till I die
Put it down anywhere, take thangs for what they worth
Been a rider since birth, and the earth is my turf
So I bails in the party, everythang is cool
It's niggas in the hood I ain't seen since high school
And everybody gots stripes cause we all paid dues
Crips, Damus, and other clicks and crews
Just gettin' they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin' loose
It kinda remind me of the truce in nine-deuce
I'm even kickin' back, and I'm usually chicken hawkin
The Bloods shootin' dice, and the Crips are C-walkin
Now the party is jumpin', and the crowd's gettin' bigger
Looked up and saw four hoes to every nigga
And it's off the hook, got ya grindin' and humpin'
'Cause the backyard boogie be bumpin'

(Unh, straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
And we comin with that)

Chorus

Verse Three

Now it's out of control, and everywhere you look
Ain't nothin' but real niggas, the bustas got shook
And everybody left with the whole hustla bang
And Daisy Dukes and khakis do seem to be the thang
You choose or you lose while you conversatin'
Enough cock to go around, so ain't no playa hatin'
I want homegirl over there in red
Cause Baby Got Backs like Mix-a-Lot said
When I keep my composure, kick back like a pro
Cause Mack one-oh just refuse to save a ho
But it's a done deal, locked up throw away the key
'Cause she gonna leave a backyard boogie with me

[Ice Cube]
(Get yo' boogie on, yeah
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood, pause
Get yo' backyard boogie on)

Outro-Chorus

Straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
Mackness, mackness, unh!
Get yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on, nigga get yo' boogie on
Get yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on baby, pause
Get yo' backyard boogie on
Gangstas don't dance we boogie
Niggas run out and get yo' cookies
Gangstas don't dance we boogie
Mack 10 ain't no motherfucker rookie
Backyard boogie oogie oofie [repeat 8X]

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
One, one two
Check me out right here yo

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo, the sun don't shine forever
You can turn the track up a little bit for me
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
All up in my ears
Better now than never, business before pleasure
The mic is loud, but the beats isn't loud
P. Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight (YEAH!)
So when you hear somethin', make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin'
YEAH! Now the mic is lower, turn the mics up
Our music keeps you movin', what are you provin'?
Turn that shit all the way up, yeah
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Music's gettin' louder
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby
This shit is hot!
Talkin' crazy, ain't gon' get you nuthin' but choked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And BIG you know you too hard for these cats
I'ma win 'cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin' up facts (uhh) you rakin' up plaques

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
In the commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the Feds hate me
The son of (*Satan*), they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin', I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin', your fam' destiny
Lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the izz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I could pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone - Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
Militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Cristal keep spillin' shit; you overdid it holmes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin' to make dough, like Jurassic
Park did quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me the underboss
Of this holocaust, truly yours, Frank White

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?

[Verse 3: Puff Daddy]
Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin' on your tape or CD
The Billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin' like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
'Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
We got the shit mapped tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two miras
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Mad he broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, we just macin' them, placin' them
In fune-rals, criminals turned aroused
To Brick City, nobody come off like P. Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman
Y'all just betray men, we spray men, I position competition
Another day in the life of the commission

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my niggas in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?

Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?
We got the real live shit from front to back

Where my niggas is at? Where my niggas is at?
Where the fuck my bitches at? Where my bitches is at?

[Puff Daddy - talking over Chorus]
Ayo, can you hear me out there?
Ayo turn me up, nobody can hear me out there
That's good, it's all fucked up now
Y'all know it's all fucked up now right?
What the fuck I'ma do now?

If you don't drop off than walk off, watch him, watch him

Chorus

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Them westcoast niggas is real set trippas (Westside)
Will get you for them zippas, on a quest for them chippas (Eastside)
Slidin while we ridin, not even hittin switches
Hangin at the high school gettin at them young bitches (what)
I got the dove sacks, homies love that (who got the bud)
Where the bud at, hollering at my big homeboy who fresh out
Hangin at my grandmama house, homie burnt out
What you gonna do when you get out of jail (speak on it)
I'm gonna have some fun (Doggy Dogg)
What do you consider fun a ounce and about five hun
So I put him on a move that I know about
Hooked him with a homegirl from the South (good lookin out)
Money made, plug a playa in the game
Especially when he represent the same thing I claim
Damn they don't make niggas like they used to
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce deuce (that's real)
Cause everybody wanna be a star
In the city of dope, a.k.a. caviar

Chorus

[Mack 10]
What have we a house full of cavi (no stress)
Well known ridas from different sides of the West
Got the hi-zoes lickin up so hard we stickin up niggas
Tired of the bullshit so we clique'n up (Westside)
Nigga please we ain't trippin off C's and B's
It's the Westside Connect with the DPG's
For the cheese we jab with the gift of the gab
Always clappin (yeah), Mack, Cube and Snoop rappin
Now how did that happen it's all good (fool)
So peep game If you could
Snoop be from Long Beach and I be from Inglewood (yeah)
Now you despise cause it came to yo surprise (what)
Two well known enemies now becoming allies (damn)
In Californ-I-A we parlay the G way
Some wear red and black and some sport blue and grey
So gangsta's don't dance we hang boogie and bang
So it's the Westside Connect with the Dogg Pound Gang

Chorus

[Ice Cube]
There we have it, Ice motherfuckin Cube
The big fish, rollin with the atomic dog
Snoop Doggy Dogg, down with the ring leader
Mack motherfuckin 10, coming back once again
Nigga we make and spend nigga

Mack 10
(Repeat 3x)
And my heat goes boom boom boom boom boom boom

And my heat goes----well I'll be goddamned
This motherfucker done jammed on me (cocks gun)
And my heat goes (gunshot)

299,Southside,The Untouchable,Scarface,1997,133933,33,"

Alright, let's ride...

I spent my day right off a Holloway, broke and disgusted
Without enough money to buy food but I'm smoking so fuck it
Hit the schoolyard, no report card because I'm larger than life
Clothes smokey, eyes shining, 'cause I'm high as a kite, fuck it
High school teachers I'm a man of respect
South Acres baby gangsta, I'm demandin' respect
Fuck the school vice principal, he shife and I'm leaving
Told my mama about my dope case and my mama believed him
Now my daddy got a problem 'cause I'm home for vacation
Strong and shy with a fucked mind, let him know what they facing
Got the doctors who done studied this, but niggas with doubt
Probably take a shrink a lifetime to figure him out (Trust me)
I seen the same thing flash change violent
And motherfuckers caught in that chain remain silent
So why you figure I've be standing here shaking
Because the devils is close to taking me but I can't face him (oooooh)
My soul is controlled by the blessings of God
Still scared to walk to first ground 'cause the devil's in charge
Somebody help the lost souls find savior
'Cause I'm standing on the cut with a Tec-9 for the hoe behavior
They want to take me out the game like Rider
But you youngstas better stop and peep game because my game wider
I send this out to those who thought that they come
Cold as fuck when it came to the game and my game done

Southside south south side; southside south south side
Southside south south side; southside south south side
You know what I'm saying

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(Man! I'm back man!)
Uhh, check it out, uhh
I steps in, where the Mo's and the hoes at, baby?
Fuck all that pretty shit
Taking it back to the gutter for you motherfuckers
Niggas know the deal
Niggas know who the Don is
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Peep game, uhh, what, what, what

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Out of this world like Mars when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars (Yeah)
We built in radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like, A-C or the drop? (Haha)
Are we gonna stop? Shit, man, if my squad go broke
Your squad oughta choke, watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga, I know, might say ""Been There, Done That"" like Dre (Uh-huh)
Through hard work, I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back, or I turn to salt (Yeah)
Got nice watches, nice cars, nice bitches, and rings (C'mon)
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things (that's right)
Can't relate to motherfuckers who ain't go no cake (Uh-uh)
When you all fucked up and can't get no break (uh-huh)
When your fake-ass friends don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it (Ugh)
Fuck that, get your own, nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all asking for hits (yeah)
Nigga, it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly, but separately, 'cause now I charter my own (c'mon)
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all 'em player-haters jealous
Billboard charts should tell us (Yeah)
They can't touch us, why niggas bring the ruckus?
Because release dates' bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets (These ghetto streets)
And every day, they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
I try to bring you life, but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the barrel, with the chrome, with the lead
'Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flown through your head
I been rich, I been poor, I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said Jigga's zone's like the falling of Rome
Reoccurring, that he thinks like that 'cause he's observant
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggas study my bones
Mentally, been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, unseen like Allah's body
In fact, my thoughts don't differ much from that of Godbody
But it's the R-shottie that got cats likening me to the mob John Gotti
Rap dudes biting me 'cause I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me, y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly, we mourn all the rappers that's gone
Niggas that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk 'em through it, you know, talk 'em through it
Know these beats is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness, and y'all knew this when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty in a girdle coming out of B-W-I
In school, I hated algebra, but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi before I die
And it's gon' happen, whether rapping or clapping, have it your way
'Cause if that's my dough you're trapping, I'm clapping your way
It's for the ghetto...

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive (stay alive)
It's just reality (reality)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Damn, it feel good to see people up on it (Ugh)
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it (Uh-huh)
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes
To get richer than Richie quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High-caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
In my circumference, mad bitches with mad Lucci
Bulletproof vestses under they Coogis
Spittin' my Uzi, don't lose me, my trigger niggas represent
Driving dirty in J-30's gettin' bent (Uh-huh)
And to my hit hoes, my murder mamis
I be smokin' trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin' niggas with punani, like heiny
And Cyrus up in Cypress
Fuck you raw, you on the floor with the virus
While I just slang coke, smoke pounds of choke (Uh-huh)
Got lawyers watching lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin' off up in my loft, of course, I know my shit's tight
Sunrise, open my eyes, no surprise
Got my shorty flyin' in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half-Black, half-oriental, eighty-six, she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental
What? From a, from a young G's perspective, ugh...
What? From a, from a young G's perspective, ugh...

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality, it's just reality
Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

302,Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem),Vol.2 ... Hard Knock Life,JAY-Z,1998-11-29,238466,66,"

[Produced By: Mark the 45 King]

[Intro]
Take the bass line out
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it bump though

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 1]
From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 2]
I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 3]
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Intro]
Uh
Something new

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is, New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
Lemme find out there's some more niggas that's runnin' with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight then you haven't met the apes

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 2]
Is y'all niggas crazy? I'll bust you and be Swayze
Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business, lady
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down, watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny? Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Rob niggas on Ravine, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And, yo, I'm a slave 'til my home is the grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 3]
Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit? With this one here I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? Boom, not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that four-four
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me, bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make a move, got a point to prove
Gotta make 'em groove, got 'em all like, ""Ooh""
So 'til the next time you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop

[Outro]
Talk is cheap, motherfucker!

Look at the sky
All the stars, man, the stars is beautiful tonight
Look at 'em

[Hook: Mya & (ODB)]
Ghetto supastar (Supastar)
That is what you are (That's what you are)
Coming from afar (Coming from afar)
Reaching for the stars (Reaching from the stars)
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh (Yeah)
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 1: Pras]
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got hopes and dreams, we got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me? I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic legalese; no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'ma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Letting bygones be bygones, and so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat how to live in the ghetto
Keeping it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
Pa-Pa-Politic with ghetto senators on the D-low

[Hook: Mya & (ODB)]
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar (Uh-huh)
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 2 : ODB]
One, two, and you don't stop, yo!
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Tryna find what's really going on in the streets

[Verse 3: Pras]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree
Kick your balls like Pelé, pick 'em doing ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yelling, ""Ole!""
Who the hell wanna save me?, From B.K. to Cali

[Hook: Mya & (Pras)]
Ghetto supastar (Come on, uh)
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 3: Pras]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
Two-faced, getting defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

[Verse 4: ODB]
Well, I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hanging out
Partying with girls that never die, you see, I was
Picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood

[Chorus: Mya & (Pras)]
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
(Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh)
From one corner to another, uh-huh (yeah)
(All-stars)
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me (Sing it, baby) to another place (Sing it, baby)
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh
(Uh-huh, yeah)

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We takin' another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin' every city then we headed to that Bat cave
ATL, Georgia, what do we do for ya?
Bulldoggin' hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy, you sounding silly, think my Brougham ain't sittin' pretty
Doing doughnuts 'round you suckas like them circles around titties
Damn, we, the committee, gon' burn it down
But us gon' bust you in the mouth with the chorus now, say

Say, ah ha, hush that fuss
Everybody move to the back of the bus
Do you wanna bump and slump with us?
We the type of people make the club get crunk

[Verse 2: André 3000]
I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said, ""Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has-what'""
That's one to live or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
André, got to her station, here's my destination she got off the bus The conversation lingered in my head for hours took a shower Kinda sour 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' wit it
But I'm witcha 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow, when in doubt, went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky
Awfully sad and it's costly, but that's all she
Wrote and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, ""It's weak"" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down
When all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is, ""Them niggas earned that crown"", but until then

[Hook: Big Boi]
Ah ha, hush that fuss

[Intro]
Yeah, as a shorty, playing in the front yard of the crib
Fell down, and I bumped my head
Somebody helped me up and asked me if I bumped my head
I said, ""Yeah""
So then they said, ""Oh, so that mean we gon', you gon' switch it on 'em?""
I said' ""Yeah, Flipmode, Flipmode is the greatest""
Knowing as a shorty, I was always told
That if I ain't gon' be part of the greatest
I gotta be the greatest myself

[Verse 1]
C'mon, c'mon, yeah, c'mon
Yeah, nigga, what? What a surprise

Got a big gun, and I'ma show you the size
You fuck wit' any of my Flipmode family ties
Me and my niggas be comin' through stalkin' you out
Killin' off any and everything you talkin' about

Yo, she tellin' news on how you switch to a bitch
Little fake funny style, nigga chill with a snitch
So now I pass you straight up I don't got nothing to ask you
Make a little room for me and all my niggas to pass through
Cartier, Sidney Poitier, hooray shit

And even worse, if I was broke would you want me
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
Bitches kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a baller, so you can shop and tear the mall up
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up
Get it up I put it down e'rytime it pop up, huh

Feel the juice, then I got ya - when you produce a rock

I fucks with my Gat out, bounce and leave a hundred
Makin' 'em feel slutted even if they don't want it
It's been so long, since I met a chick ain't about chips but then I'm
Dead wrong, when I tell 'em, ""be gone""
So hold on to the feelin' of flossin' and plat-num
'Cause from now on, you can witness Ja the i-con

[Intro: Lil' Kim]
See, I believe in money, power and respect
First you get the money, then you get the motherfuckin' power
After you get the fuckin' power, motherfuckers will respect you (What's the key to life?)

[Chorus: Lil Kim]
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, you can sleep at night
You'll see the light, what's the key to life?
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, money, power and respect
Money, power and respect

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch & Lil Kim]
Ayo, my whole clique 'bout it, 'bout it
We take yours while you pout about it
Truck, step out, the whores wanna crowd around it
You could see me on Optimum TV
Go in your bathroom turn the light out
Scream, ""Bloody Mary, 1, 2, 3""
Sheek ain't your usual friend
But I could set you up like Keyser and walk straight at the end
I'm done with ice and charms
I'm tryna ice my whole casket when I'm gone
Pull up with class on the don, once I meet 'em I greet 'em
Kiss his feet for freedom, tell em' thank you Lord
'Cause on Earth I was gettin' bored
Now resurrect me back to this cat called Sheek
So I can make this album and get back the cats that's weak
Two-thirty, six two
Me budge for you? That's like a cat vers' a pitbull
Gun, know clip full, keep hunger
And plan for the future, 'cause you figure you gon' be older
Way longer than you gon' be younger (What's the key to life?)

[Chorus: Lil Kim]
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, you can sleep at night
You'll see the light, what's the key to life?
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, money, power and respect
Money, power and respect, it's the key to life

[Verse 2: Styles P & Lil Kim]
Only time could tell how the clock tick
I'm really loved here, but I'm still a hostage
Two personalities, check the posture
Smoke out the mouth clear out the nostrils
Think of death, then life seem scary
I'm passin' graveyards seein' people Hail Mary
I ain't chillin' 'til I'm out parachutin'
Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds
Twenty five thousand a piece, fuck streets
Tryin' to own the island, forget about wildin'
Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'
If I showed you where I lived, you would think I was hidin'
Sling dick to chicks that don't speak English
Wake up in Trinidad like, ""Fuck it, I'm rich""
Come back, private jet, live on set
If you can shit gold, then I can spit baguettes (What's the key to life?)

[Chorus: Lil Kim]
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, you can sleep at night
You'll see the light, what's the key to life?
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, money, power and respect
Money, power and respect

[Verse 3: Jadakiss & Lil Kim]
Nothin' but the hotness whenever we drop this
Monotonous for y'all to keep hatin' 'cause y'all never gon' stop us
I keep my rocks spotless and my hoes topless
Take time, try to figure out who The Lox is
Fear no one, kick rhymes like shoguns
You scared to blow one, get robbed with your own gun
If I don't respect you I'ma check you
And if I don't kiss you I'ma peck you
Right before I wet you I sneeze on tracks and bless you
I'm special and if you like workin' out then I'm gon' stretch you
Hustlin' is dead, but we still get red
Turn the spots into bakeries to get back bread
And y'all said my money's spent, but it's in the Bent'
So when the Feds come, the dogs can't get a scent
And my story, self-explanatory
That I'm the hottest thing on the street
And y'all ain't got nothin' for me (What's the key to life?), yeah

[Chorus: Lil Kim]
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, you can sleep at night
You'll see the light, what's the key to life?
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, money, power and respect
Money, power and respect

[Verse 4: DMX & Lil Kim]
This is a beat that I can freak to, just drop the reels
Bless a nigga with the ill, y'all niggas know my skills
X in their grills, hit 'em up, split 'em up
Wet 'em up and watch 'em come get 'em up
Set em' up, when you do dirt, you get dirt
Bitch, I'll make your shit hurt, step back like, ""I did work""
This ain't no fuckin' game, what, you think I'm playin'?
'Til you layin' somewhere in the junkyard decayin'
Moms at home prayin' that you comin' home, but you not
'Cause you sittin' up in the trunk, startin' to rot
And hell is hot, I know because I'm here now, baby
It's goin' down, baby, get the four pound, baby
And let off up in a nigga
Especially if he think he bigger than my motherfuckin' trigger
Dead eye, can I get mine? Is he gone?
DMX representin' one time, put us on (What's the key to life?)

[Chorus: Lil Kim]
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, you can sleep at night
You'll see the light, what's the key to life?
Money, power and respect what you need in life
Money, power and respect, you'll be eatin' right
Money, power and respect, money, power and respect
Money, power and respect

[Chorus]
Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

[Verse 1]
Now, I'm gon' start collecting props, connecting plots
Networking like a conference ‘cause the nonsense is yet to stop
Jakes shake me down, haters wanna take me down
Break me down, CLAP! – all they heard was a sound
Yo, I scoped it out, I took your weak dream and choked it out
Your bitch don't really got no ass, she just poked it out
On the D-low, I'm saying you versus me though?
We can do this shit right here in front of your people
See, time is money, kid and BS walks
And to me it's funny, kid when you meatheads talk
I see feds stalk, they wanna dig up the dirt, son
Is it me they hawk? ‘Cause I be putting in work, son

[Chorus]
Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

[Verse 2]
You cornballs get stonewalled, blackballed, I own y'all
The veteran, running my plan, I'm the better man
Crazy raw, doing my job like the mob
Blazing y'all and disappearing in the fog
Or a mist and chicks can't resist what I kick
They be begging for attention or some more of the dillznick
Word up, baby, someone may have to get hurt up, baby
Shit is mad shady, but I got to get the gravy
Platinum respect like the force of a TEC
Keep you hitting the deck, feeling heat in your chest
Banging your thoughts with the hot onslaught
A kid got shot on the spot for going where he should not
Viciously, I make history instantly
Those other lame-ass loser-ass niggas, they can't fuck with me
I'm doing my thing now to lamp later on
Paid in the shade with some fly gators on
But now I'm grimy as they get, mud on my pants and shirt
I bet you niggas out here know, I be putting in work

[Chorus]
Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

[Intro: Big Boi & André 3000]
Yuh
Uh-huh

[Chorus: André 3000]
Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, ""Y""
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
(Y'all know)
It's him and I: Aquemini

[Break: Big Boi]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Now is the time to get on—like Spike Lee said, ""Get on the Bus""
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping—it's a must
Is you on that dust or corn starch? Familiar with that smack, man?
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack-man
Pacman, how in the fuck you think we gon' do that, man?
Riding round Old National on eighteens without no gat, man
I'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga, we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times, swung hard when it was fitting
But now, we tapping the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood-grain steering wheel, for real (Real)
You can go on and chill out and still build
Let your paper stack 'stead of going into overkill
And pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

[Break: Big Boi & André 3000]
Yeah
Yuh, yuh (Yeah)

[Chorus: André 3000]
Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, ""Y""
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
And nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
Lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from ""home of the brave,"" with dirty dollars
Beauty parlors, baby ballers, bowling-ball Impalas
Street scholars, majoring in culinary arts—
You know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough from scratch
But, see, the catch is you can get caught
Know what you selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge—meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walking slowly to the candy lady
It's looking bad—
Need some hope like the words ""maybe,"" ""if,"" or ""probably""
More than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry, y'all, I often drift—I'm talking gift
So when it comes, you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course, you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it, but it's needed, so what have you?
Now, question: Is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall?
Naww, so don't get caught up in appearance
It's OutKast, ""Aquemini"": another Black experience

[Break: André 3000]
Okay

[Chorus: André 3000]
Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, ""Y""
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax, the nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that, some say we pro-Black, but we professional
We missed a lot of church, so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks, you bust 'round, we bust back
G—Get back for real niggas that's out here tryna spit facts
You 'ear that? You can't come near that, maybe you need to quit (Quit)
Because ""Aquemini"" is Aquarius and the Gemini running shit
Like this, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4: André 3000]
My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin, André Ben', welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend myself, so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it—that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, 'cause I swear, I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
""André, this is André, y'all are just gon' have to make amends""

[Chorus: André 3000]
Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, ""Y""
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
And nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini

Let the gorillas out, til the blood is spilling out
Put a slug up in his mouth, then the thug is chicken out (ha ha)

[Intro: Nate Dogg]
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah
We just tryin' make you see
Nobody does it better

[Verse 1: Warren G]
I'm sittin' here trippin', my mind is blocked
Nate Dogg just spit it so it's “Time To Concoct""
No one can do it better like this two man crew
Hey say we one-hitter quitters, now what cha'll gonna do?

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Always into somethin, that's my name
Only out for money, hey cause that's the game
People always ask me why I'm out for scratch
He who had the most is he who won the match

[Verse 3: Warren G]
Strike one, me and Nate Dogg is a match
Strike two, leave 'em standing still in their tracks
Strike three, you can call us two one three
It's the L and the B that makes me act like a G

[Verse 4: Nate Dogg]
My exhibition started back in '93
When wasn’t nobody listenin' but Warren and me
To all the nonbelievers, now I bet you see
Nobody does it better than me

Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah

There is no accident for these platinum hits
So when we make it to show love, bangin' in your club
Hangin' with your thugs, givin' up G love

[Verse 6: Nate Dogg]
Do you remember back on the east side?
When all of us niggas used to love to ride
We didn't care what we did
Time was nothing to us, we were just kids
Times are different now, but you still get stuck
I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck
So if you really think you wanna step to me
Keep this is mind: nobody does it better than me

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah
We just tryin' make you see

Got a baby, so I'm breakin' hearts now
On your mark, get set, it starts now

[Verse 8: Nate Dogg]
All you pimp playin' hustlers, now ya know
You can't keep me out once you crack the door
Either join a team or it's best you flee
Nobody does it better than me

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
They can come closer than close, yeah
Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah
We just tryin' make you see
Nobody does it better

Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Messing me up, my whole head
Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin
Now look at what you're starting
Schoolboy's crush and it ain't on the hush
The whole world sees it but you can't (uh)
My peoples they complain, sit and rave and rant (come on)
Your name is out my mouth like an ancient chant (say what?)
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant
*heavy breathing*

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Speaking of which
Got a leash and I wish just to rock you miss (C'mon)
Make a militant move, peep my strategy (What?)
End of the day you're not mad at me (Ugh)
Not dealing with nobody, now that's what you told me (What?)
I said, ""Hey yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly"" (C'mon)
'Cause yo, picture me messing it up
Her mind not corrupt, with the ill C-cups
Shit, I'm on my J.O. (C'mon)
Bullshitting, hoping that the day goes slow (what?)
Got me like a friend, what confuses me though
Is kisses when we breeze, tell me what's the deal, yo?
(Deal yo, yo, yo...)

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way (ha-ha!)
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things (come on)
Should I just sit out or come harder? (huh?)
Help me find my way

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Now why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Making things for me towards you harder
Killing me, just when I think we're there
You douse the whole vibe and the flows in the air
Telling me 'bout next man
But next man ain't the nigga with the plan
Who got your heart in mind?
It's about time that you just unwind (C'mon)

[Verse 4: Phife Dawg]
And let it just happen, make it front-free (uh)
Just sweat me like Moneypenny (uh)
Digging you, getting inside of your stee (what?)
It's the Quest cat keeping you company (ha)
Forever, or however you want it

[Verse 5: Q-Tip]
Word, word
Now wait a minute, ma, before you jet into the curb (Yeah, yeah)
Start to make affections, which is goo,d not the herb
But it, it ain't me, and I, I ain't blurred (Ugh)
I'ma still just chill with you
Maybe things could change if you change your view (C'mon)
If not, then, I guess it is cool (Yeah)
Just to keep to yourself and abide by the rules, right

[Bridge: Q-Tip]
Like that y'all
Check it out now...

Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way (Now sing it)
Now you caught my heart for the evening (Sing it out)
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things (Take your time)
Should I just sit out or come harder?

Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things

How I get money niggas you try to peep it
Flipmode be niggas you wanna form a team with
Them get money niggas the ones to plot the scheme with
Them niggas that be used to getting money frequent
The ones that would always measure my triple beam with
Until they start taking my niggas to the precinct
That's all back in the day yo that ain't nothing recent
Cause now-a-days it be bitches we like to speak with
Eat with
Lay them down and sleep with
Type of pussy make a nigga wanna keep it
Shorty be so exotic she looking decent

Now, everytime that I meet a nigga who fronting
It's alright cause you getting money and everybody want it
Smoke a big spliff

Fall on the floor and I gotta call my S500
Iceburg 5 where you at
No need for alarm
Right now I'm cruising to the sounds of my enhanced CD-ROM
Hurry up 5
Ayyo you know it's about to get thick
I see this cat a way behind my back about to do a stick
Tell me where you at
I will be there in 10 seconds flat
You know I got your back
I'll be there just in time to counteract
Sometimes I'm unforget cooth
My S5 bulletproof
I turbo boost
And blast right through your motherfucking roof
Coming through
Hitting you
Knocking out a nigga's tooth
Full speed ahead like we running a toll booth
Produce more flavor than Very Fine juice
Call a truce
Before me and my niggas'll let loose

All my ladies in the place to be
Getting money while they next to me
Let me see
Let me hear you say fire it up (fire it up)
Say fire it up (fire it up)

Getting money all across the land
One time
Let me hear you say fire it up (fire it up)
Say fire it up (fire it up)
C'MON!

Bleach the heat
You're letting loose to the extreme
Me and the Iceburg S5 bounce from the scene
Recline my seat rock to the beat
Leaning so hard, it's like my whole squad up in the Jeep
Blowing up the spot or we hit them know what I mean
Got you open we keeping you niggas up like caffine
Flying guillotine
Seeing everything on my little computer screen
From here to Phillipine
Keep it moving we never run out of gasoline
Gas me you ossen a nigga with kerosine
Me and my 5 be running some mission you've never seen
Hot shit making you niggas forever feen
Anyone of you coming, you better come clean
Hit you with an overdose of more rhyme and Phetamine
Got your eye blood shot you need Physine

Spit your flow, get your dough
Can't fuck with this Roc-A-Fella shit though

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em with numerous shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots wanna talk to po-po's, smoke 'em like coco
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshit, Glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin' shocked when the fool hit
Oh, hey ma, how you? Know niggas wanna buy you
But see, me? I wanna fuck for free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly
If it's tight, get the K-Y Jelly
All night, get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side 'til you say, ""Jay-Z, you're too much for me.""

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Got a condo with nothin' but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes invented
So all I do is rap and sex—imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowin' on my last cassette?
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin' a TEC, never jam though
Never get hot, never run out of ammo
Niggas hatin' and shit 'cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick, and now you
Actin' raw, but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your ho, wanna marry your ho
Now she's mad at me 'cause Your Majesty
Just happened to be a pimp—what a tragedy!
She want us to end 'cause I fucked her friend
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in
I said, ""Shit, there's a draught, shut the door, bitch, and come on in!""

[Chorus: Jay-Z & (Amil)]
(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me
(Nigga who?) Recognize bitch, Jay to the Z

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Got a vendetta even though I been better
Left him in the cold with a thin sweater
Rap niggas on Prozac get the bozack
Niggas threw two at me, I threw four back, hold that
Let the dough stack
Way before Biggs had the gold Ac', Dame had the Lex black
Motherfuckers wanna test that, stress that
And right where you're stressed at, where you rest at
I suggest that niggas invest in a vest
When I come through with the Glock, jet-black
You niggas step back
I'm the best at, you know I ain't no apprentice to this
Me and my niggas, we invented the shit
I came into the business with this
The Originator, none greater, Jaz-O, finish this shit!

[Verse 4: Big Jaz (Jay-Z)]
Better learn, Jaz'll relax that, ever heard of me?
Worldwide Originator, say word to me
The population holla, ""Certainly""
I burn a nigga like a third degree
See me shine so bright
Nigga, I'm my light, runnin' rulin' with rigor and vigor
Nobody bigger than me and my nigga Jigga
You fly-by-night, stop chirpin' B
Heavyweight's light work for me
For the time in this motherfucker ain't nobody hurtin' me
What, cut your face in like surgery
Who the fuck got a VS
Fuckin' BM's on the road
When you had to be in bed at the PM
Need the info, Jaz on the C-N-N
Forever touchin', my work is beginnin', you’re endin'
Nigga, your style's no style, my style's hostile, c'mon
Faggot nigga, down to take the gun home
The o-ri-gi-na-tor!
(Can't fuck with it, can ya?!)

(Nigga what?) Make you think you can fuck with me

[Guru talking]
That makes me know that what we're doing
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
With the times and everything y'know
So y'know the rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved

[Intro]
The real (The real)
Hip-hop (Hip-hop)
MCing (MCing), and DJing (DJing)
From your own mind (From your own mind)
You know? (You know?)
I, I guess right now we should start the show

[Verse 1: Guru]
Who's the suspicious character
Strapped with the sounds profound?
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin' like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin' caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin' all the rappers who lack over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whoop ass
Droppin' lyrics that be hotter than sex and candle wax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin', on its axis
I come with mad lovin', plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this
So many people searchin' for false bliss
I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sorta like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez

[Hook]
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live, keep it live)
To the beat y'all

[Verse 2]
The beat is sinister, Premo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin' the wax
I be bringin' salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin' more power
Stealin' at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin' like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid
But still can't make the fuckin' grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo, they must wanna fry
They can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness, carryin' my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holdin' down the fort
You know my steez
(You know my steez)

[Hook]
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
The mic

[Verse 3]
On the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet
Tryin' to be fly, ridin' high on the jet
Set with juvenile rhymes, makin' fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's somethin' you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out, you be like, ""Damn, he flipped!""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, givin' you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick, why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin' riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas
Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speakin' from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche
In this rap shit, you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright like neon
Your song's pathetic, synthetic like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on
Want dope rhymes? Put me on
Word is bond
You know my steez

[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Ready for war, Joe, how you wanna blow they spot?
I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop
Hop in your Hummer, the Punisher's ready
Meet me at Vito's with Noodles
We'll do this dude while he's slurpin' spaghetti
Everybody kiss the fuckin' floor
Joey Crack, buck 'em all if they move—
Noodles, shoot that fuckin' whore!
Dead in the middle of Little Italy
Little did we know that we riddled some middlemen who didn't do diddly

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
It'll be a cold day in Hell the day I take an L
Make no mistake for real, I wouldn't hesitate to kill
I'm still the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mother's wake
Smack you, then I whack you with my snub three-eight

[Verse 3: Big Pun]
I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family's children
Like Amityville, and drill the nerves in your cavity fillin'
Insanity's buildin' a pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealin'
A villain without remorse who's willin' to out your boss forever
And take all the cheddar like child support

[Verse 4: Fat Joe & Big Pun]
I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves
My brother from another mother, sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me; one of the best—might be even better
Leavin' niggas kneelin' on they right knee
Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture
You small change, I'm blowin' out your brains, gettin' richer
Hit you with the Mac (Mac), smack your bitch, nigga what?
You gettin' stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck
Truck jewels (Jewels), cruisin' in the Land, bumpin' ""Cash Rules""
Last crew to want it caught a hundred tryna pass through
That's true! (So who the next to get it?)
T.S. the best that did it
(Get it off your chest, kid, admit it, and it's…)

[Chorus: Fat Joe & Big Pun]
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Twenty-shot Glock with the cop-killers, fill 'em to the top
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Joey cracks the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked
Yeah, and you don't stop!
We'll make it hot, nigga, what? Bring it, I blow your whole spot
Yeah, and you don't stop!
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop

[Verse 5: Big Pun]
Fuck the police, I squeeze first, make 'em eat dirt
Take 'em feet-first through the morgue, then lodge 'em in the deep earth
The street's cursed, the First Amendment's culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights
Tonight, I hold my rosaries tight as I can
I'm one man against the world, just me and my girl
Black Pearl Latina, más fina, but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it, it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it

[Verse 6: Fat Joe]
Creep with me, as I cruise in my Bimmer
All the kids in the ghetto call me ""Don Cartagena""
Kickin' ass as I blast off heat, and
You never see me talk to police
Though you should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat
And I'll leave you right there, so beware
It's rare that niggas want beef
Big Pun, speak, and let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets

[Verse 7: Big Pun]
Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashin'
Catchin' niggas while they sleepin', no relaxin'
Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three TECs is in the Jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto scholars
Full-of-clips mob, inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down
Until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock down

[Verse 8: Fat Joe]
We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine every time
Plus, I'm the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk, all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk our prey like a predator
Whoever want it, go and get it; set it, baby, and I'ma bury ya
So remember the Squad that I'm reppin'
I fill a clip of my weapon and punish niggas 'til it's armageddon

[Chorus: Fat Joe & Big Pun]
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Twenty-shot Glock with the cop-killers, fill 'em to the top
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Joey cracks the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked
Yeah, and you don't stop!
We'll make it hot, nigga, what? Bring it, I blow your whole spot
Yeah, and you don't stop!
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Twenty-shot Glock with the cop-killers, fill 'em to the top
Yeah, and you don't stop!
Joey cracks the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked

They heard what that nigga say, ""Puff puff pass, motherfucker""
""Puff puff pass, motherfucker""
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Sim Simma, who got the key to my Bimmer?
Jack move, that's how we act when we team up
Throw your triple beam up, this is fish scale
I bailed out the county with counterfeit bills
My slang be high range Brick City
Watch how you sniff, son, I'm highly octane
All you hear is bang, bang (Bang, bang)
Yo, remember you, bitch? Shit, I forget my last name
It's all about game, nuttin' else, for delf
Walk through the woods then stomp on your foot
With high, I take out any comp in the hood
Gorilla impact in this rap habitat
Get you steppin' in your Air Max, bounce
You cockin' it back but where it at? Bounce
I got a six pack of Heineken and Big Kap on the wheels
In two laps, I give Stella Her Groove Back

Startin' arsons from, Jers' to Arkan-

Roll up to the jam with the front end bent up
Watch them chickens, 'fo' end up gettin' salmonella
I'm ghetto like D&D, fuckin' wit' D
You be on Banned From TV Part III
In a heartbeat, tiger, straight out the cup
You're light in the ass, son, you weigh 'bout a buck
But I'm one-ninety physique
Two-hundred and thirty-fo' pounds total when I'm carryin' the heat
Not platinum on wax but, platinum in the streets
Any nigga that disagree, smack him in the teeth
Then I bag his little piece, rockin' the ice
Give it to the projects for the rhyme of the night
(Why you actin like dat?) The weed made me do it
Devil's Advocate hot, it take days to do it

Yeah that's right, this cut goes out to all y'all that's been missin' us for mad years
One love y'all
Yeah that's right, He Got Game
PE 1998

[Verse 1]
If man is the father, the son is the center of the earth
In the middle of the universe, then why
Is this verse comin' six times rehearsed?
Don't freestyle much but I write 'em like such (Word)
Amongst the fiends controlled by the screens
What does it all mean, all this shit I'm seein'?
Human beings screaming vocal javelins
Signs of a local nigga unravelling (uh huh)
My wanderin' got my ass wondering
Where Christ is in all this crisis?
Hatin' Satan never knew what nice is
Check the papers while I bet on ices
More than your eye can see and ears can hear
Year by year all the sense disappears
Nonsense perseveres, prayers laced with fear
Beware, two triple O is near

[Hook]
It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin'
What is game? Who got game?
Where's the game in life, behind the game behind the game
I got game, she's got game
We got game, they got game, he got game
It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'
But fuck the game if it ain't sayin' nothin'

[Verse 2]
Damn, was it something I said?
Pretend you don't see so you turn your head
Ray scared of his shadow, does it matter?
Thought of reparations got 'em playin' with the population
Nothin to lose, everything's approved
People used, even murders excused (You preach to 'em, yo)
White men in suits don't have to jump
Still a thousand and one ways to lose with his shoes
God takes care of old folks and fools
While the devil takes care of makin' all the rules
Folks don't even own themselves
Payin' mental rent to corporate presidents (My man, my man)
Ugh, one outta million residents
Bein' dissident, who ain't kissin' it
The politics of chains and whips
Got the sick missin' chips and all the championships
What's Love Got To Do with what you got
Don't let a win get to your head or a loss to your heart (Word)
Nonsense perseveres, prayers laced with fear
Beware, two triple O is near

[Hook]
It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin'
What is game? Who got game?
Where's the game in life, behind the game behind the game
I got game, she's got game
We got game, they got game, he got game
It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'
But fuck the game if it ain't sayin' nothin'

[Interlude: Flavor Flav]
Yeah that's right, eerybody got game
But we just here to let y'all know
That PE, is in full effect, from right now till the year 2000
Aiyo, my man, sing it

[Bridge: Stephen Stills]
There's something happening here (Yeah, yeah)
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man, with a gun over there (Yeah, that's right, hah haha)
Tellin me, I got to beware
It's time we stop, children what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin, down
(Aiyo, I don't think they heard you, Stevie
Kick it to em again one more time)
It's time we stop, children what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin, down

[Interlude: Flavor Flav]
Haha, that's right boy, PE in full effect boy to the year 2000 yo

[Refrain: Shabach Community Choir of Long Island]
Stop, look, what's that sound
Everybody knows what's goin' down
Stop, look, what's that sound
Everybody knows what's goin' down

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
Come on sing it
Sing it again y'all come on
Hey!
He-hey!!!
Aiyo, these are some serious times that we're livin in G
And a new world order is about to begin, y'knowhutI'msayin?
Now the question is - are you ready, for the real revolution
Which is the evolution of the mind?
If you seek then you shall find that we all come from the divine
You dig what I'm sayin?
Now if you take heed to the words of wisdom
That are written on the walls of life
Then universally, we will stand and divided we will fall
Because love conquers all, you understand what I'm sayin?
This is a call to all you sleepin souls
Wake up and take control of your own cipher
And be on the lookout for the spirit snipers
Tryin to steal your light, y'knowhutI'msayin?
Look within-side yourself, for peace
Give thanks, live life and release
You dig me? You got me?

The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible
Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow
And so, tomorrow coming later than usual
Waiting on someone to pity us
While we find the beauty in the hideous
They say money's the root of all evil, but I can't tell
You know what I mean, pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells
Dollar bills, or is it the mind-state that's ill?
Creating crime rates to fill the new prisons they build
Over money and religion, there's more blood to spill
The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal
What's the deal?
A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke
But my language universal, they be reciting my quotes
While R&B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought
That my man Louis' statements just provoked
Caught up, in conversations of our personal worth
Brought up through endangered species status on the planet Earth
Survival tactics means busting gats to prove you hard
Your firearms are too short to box with God
Without faith, all of that is illusionary
Raise my son, no vindication of manhood necessary

[Chorus: Mos Def, Talib Kweli & Both]
Not strong, only aggressive, not free, we only licensed
Not compassionate, only polite, now, who the nicest?
Not good, but well behaved
Chasing after death so we can call ourselves brave?
Still living like mental slaves
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice

[Verse 2: Mos Def & Both]
Yo, I'm sure that everybody out listening agree
That everything you see ain't really how it be
A lot of jokers out running in place, chasing the style
Be a lot going on beneath the empty smile
Most cats in my area be loving the hysteria
Synthesized surface conceals the interior
America—land of opportunity, mirages and camouflages
More than usually
Speaking loudly, saying nothing, you confusing me, you losing me
Your game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury
Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly
Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception
Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass
Walking the street, wondering who they be looking past
Looking gassed with them imported designer shades on
Stars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on
Same song, just remixed, different arrangement
Put you on a yacht, but they won't call it the slave ship
Strangeness, you don't control us, you barely hold this
Screaming ""Brand new!"", when they just sanitized the old shit
Suppose it's, just another clever Jedi mind trick
That they been running across stars through all the time with
I find it's distressing, there's never no in-between
We either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens
The deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse
Full of short attention spans, short tempers, and short skirts
Long barrel automatics released in short bursts
The length of black life is treated with short worth
Get yours first, them other niggas secondary
That type of illing that be filling up the cemetery
This life is temporary, but the soul is eternal
Separate the real from the lie, let me learn you
Not strong, only aggressive 'cause the power ain't directed
That's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive
Not free, we only licensed, not live, we just exciting
'Cause the captors own the masters to what we writing
Not compassionate, only polite, we well trained
Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game
Not good, but well behaved, 'cause the cameras survey
Most of the things that we think, do or say
We chasing after death just to call ourselves brave
But everyday, next man meet with the grave
I give a damn if any fan recall my legacy
I'm trying to live life in the sight of God's memory
Like that, y'all

[Interlude: Mos Def & Talib Kweli]
A lot of people don't understand the true criterion of things
Can't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence
They ain't looking around

[Chorus: Talib Kweli, Mos Def, & Both]
Not strong, only aggressive, not free, we only licensed
Not compassionate, only polite, now who the nicest?
Not good, but well behaved
Chasing after death so we can call ourselves brave?
Still living like mental slaves
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice

[Outro: Mos Def & Talib Kweli]
Stop hiding, stop hiding
Stop hiding yo' face yes, c'mon
Stop hiding, stop hiding celebrating death
'Cause ain't no hiding place
Stop hiding, stop hiding
Stop hiding yo' face
Stop hiding, stop hiding
'Cause ain't no hiding place
Not strong
Not free
Not compassionate
We well trained
Black Star

(Ad libs to fade)
Black Star keep shining
We take the Black Star line right on home

(together) Hiero, y'all...

[Verse 1: A-Plus]
It's not a wrong thing
To be addicted to the microphone like a heron fiend
I'll tell you one thing:
You'll never catch me fronting
As I proceed to give the people what they wanting
You're making some green...
But not for glamour or fashion
I'm stacking cash until I can get Moms a mansion
All from rapping?
Nah, man, there's many plans
Like investing in land
It started all from impressing the fans
With brand new flows
And you know
All the way from gangsta clones to weirdos
Fools used those
But we ain't tripping
Give respect when you see this
You need us
Or your rhymes underdeveloped like a fetus

[Verse 2: Pep Love]
Those that know not doze
And it shows
When we broke out the knock
Hoes hopped out they clothes
That's positive feedback
Yep, The Prose
I'm poised, we never pose, you'll never know
From '93 til infinity we've been inventive
Creating the bump is our only incentive
And it's been a long time since I feel I've been felt
But the only thing I fear is fear itself
So you know what we gots to do
Maybe could we keep it within the crew
Like it should be?
Never givin' out
We're livin' out our dreams
If there's something I can't live without
That's my team
You never knew...

[Verse 3: Phesto]

World-renowned, we ground-breaking

Del, been rhyming for more than a decade
Onto the next stage, while emcees need aid
Stay paid, I'm still grade-A
None of that tomfoolery
As you can see this shit ain't nothing new to me
Utterly hovering over other things material
You're stuck in the here and now
Plus you're sweating profusely, here's a towel
Your fears are now reality
When I take your dream states
And elaborate on how your team's fake
Like phony IDs, but sometimes I feel like
Only I see through the charade you've made
In today, but hey, tomorrow it's played
And then they got a new fool in your place to be okayed

[Verse 5: Tajai]
Hieroglyphics
Hip-hop is vintage
Invented in days back
Rekindling in ways that many thought was lost
In this contemporary maze of methods to floss
We finding trees and trails to blaze
Boundaries to cross
We can be found beyond the bounds of reason
Or earthbound, heatin' up the Coliseum

[Verse 6: Opio]
They rushed the stage full-throttle in Chicago
Our brains interlocked
Where fakin' emcees get caught with the 40-bottle
Or get their chains snatched, pronto
We unstoppable, droppin' flows in Toronto
Maneuverin' through Vancouver and on to Japan
Where they put major grands in my hand
Follow...

[Verse 7: Phesto]
Straight from the heart we set apart from the rest an'
Our perfection on the microphone was predestined
World-renowned, we ground-breaking

326,You Ain't a Killer,Capital Punishment (Explicit Version),Big Pun,1998-04-28,254866,53,"

[Verse 1]
The harsh realities of life have taken toll
Even Jesus Christ forsake my soul
Please tell me what price to pay to make it whole
Take control, I'm makin' dough but not enough to blow
JO's, they lust my flows, but ayo, I don't trust a soul
That's all I know or need to, these evil streets'll meet you halfway and eat you alive tryin' to survive illegal
I'll leave you lost, mount you on a cross
Whip you like a horse, sacrifice your life to a higher force
Then I'll stomp your corpse
It's the Bronx of course, recognize the accent
One of the last livin' still-in-action general assassins
Catchin' any wreck, blastin' any TEC, smashin' any chest
Passin' any test; Charles Manson in the flesh
Any last requests before you meet your maker?
Sow what you reap or wake up
Shakin' up a storm, like Anita Baker
I'll take you straight to Hell and fill your heart with hate
Incarcerate your fate in Satan's fiery lake, then I lock the gate
Make no mistake, this shit as real as Joe
We follow the killer's code
When we come for you, tell me: where will you go?
Nowhere to run, hide, I'll find you and silence your screams
And even if you kill me, I'll still be in your fuckin' dreams

[Chorus]
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat

[Verse 2]
You've made a grave mistake
Shouldn't have come here, you changed your fate
Your brains'll make their debut on the table
When I raise the stakes
The pain is great, but only for a second
It starts strong, then lessens
Just when you restin', the Armaggedon sets in
Left him with so much stress (T.S.)
Blessed him with no regrets, yes
Welcome to Hell, son, the threshold of death
Face the serpent, I blaze your person
You get laced for certain, leavin' Jakes no trace to work from
Close the case like curtains
I'm hurtin' heads severely, really tryin' to bring the pain
There's nothin' more satisfyin'
Than when you cryin', screamin' my name
It's not a game, it's Purple Rain, floods of bloodstains
Big Pun's my thug's name
Bustin' my guns, that's my love thang
I'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your Adam's Apple
John Madden-tackle your corpse
To hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
That'll have to hurt, I'll work your body 'til it burst
Then curse tu vida like a Brujería verse
I'm worse than anything you ever been through
Sick in the head and mental
Essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan, when I'm the rhymin' abomination

[Chorus]
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat

[Verse 3]
It's hard to analyze which guys are spies; be advised, people
We recognize who lies, it's all in the eyes, chico
We read 'em and see 'em for what they are
D's in undercover cars
Takin' my picture like I'm a fuckin' star
I'm up to par, my game is in a smash
With half a million in the stash
Passport with the gats, first name and last
Ask anybody if my men are rowdy
Give me the mini-shottie
I'll body a nigga for a penny probably
I'm obligated to anything if it's crime-related
If it shine, I'll take it; still in my prime and I finally made it
I hate the fact that I'm the last edition
Properly a stats magician
Could've went to college and been a mathematician
Bad decisions kept me out the game
Now I'm strictly out for cream
Doin' things to fiends I doubt you'll ever dream
My team's the meanest thing you ever seen
Measured by the Heaven's kings
Down to the Devil's mezzanine
I've never screamed so loud, I'm proud to be alive
Most heads die by 25 or catch a quick three-to-five
So be advised: the street's full of surprises
It's not what crew's the livest
One that survive, it's who's the wisest

[Chorus]
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk
From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk
Mark you for death
Won't even talk that East or West crap
From Watts to LeFrak
It ain't where you're from, it's where's your gat
You ain't a killer...

328,The Militia,Moment Of Truth,Gang Starr,1998-03-31,288577,41,"

[Intro]
""Here's a bulletin from state police, Princeton Junction.""

""The militia...
Certain individuals of unidentified nature
Is now under complete control""

""Hip-hop is not, what it is today..""

""It's the real *echoes*... it's the (militia)""

[Verse 1: Big Shug]
If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin' name
I eradicate move fakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with life takers, have sex with rump shakers
I make moves so I'mma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin' and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's all right, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
'Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
With the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin' up, just straight shuttin' up
Or we'll start the wettin' up
Lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you
Big Shug, Guru, Freddie Foxxx, The Militia, militia

[Hook: Freddie Foxxx]
Everybody's spittin' it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia
Everybody's spittin' it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia

[Verse 2: Guru]
Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, 'til everybody knows
That I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
Til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
For big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin', my name and face you're rememberin'
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin'
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
That I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded Glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin'
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

[Hook: Freddie Foxxx]
Everybody's spittin' it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia

[Verse 3: Freddie Foxxx]
You niggas owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggas in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is butter baby, spread it around
But when you niggas don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit a ""buck"" in the face
Of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggas and how I bust up their nose
And while your, nose is drippin', and drainin' blood
I'll be standing over you screamin', ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in their palm
'Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin Glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect *gun clicks* you get the tech
I turn you fake niggas on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggas, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You step inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggas who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay one up, what's up?
I got stripes like you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggas do best - bite
Y'all niggas can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Preem' brought Bumpy this track so I'ma let you know
Before I slide I'mma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools
It's the Militia

[Intro]
Uh, Def Jam
Uh, Ruff Ryders
My nigga TP
Creep with me!

[Verse 1: DMX, DMX as Damien, & (DMX as his son)]
Why is it every move I make turns out to be a bad one?
Where's my guardian angel? Need one, wish I had one
I'm right here, shorty, and I'ma hold you down
You tryin' to fuck all these bitches? I'ma show you how
But who…? Name's D like you, but my friends call me Damien
And I'ma put you hip to somethin' about this game we in
You and me could take it there, and you'll be
The hottest nigga ever livin', that's a given? You'll see
Hmm, that's what I've been wantin' all my life
Thinkin' about my little man so I call my wife
Well, your dada is about to make it happen
(What you mean, my nigga?) I'm about to make it rappin'
Today I met this cat, he said his name was Damien
He thinks that we're a lot alike and wants to be my friend
(You mean like Chuckie?) Ha ha, yeah, just like Chuckie
(Dada, looks like we're both lucky) Yeah

[Chorus]
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?

[Verse 2: DMX & DMX as Damien]
Ayo, D, whattup, D? You's a smooth nigga
I seen you when nobody knew who pulled the trigger
Yeah, you know, it's always over dough
You sure? I coulda swore it was over a ho?
Nah, nah, that ain't my style, nigga, you stay frontin'
But you're still my man, and I ain't gonna say nothin'
Got some weed? Go 'head, smoke it! Go 'head, drink it!
Go 'head and fuck shorty! You know I can keep a secret (aight)
I'm about to have you drivin', probably a Benz
But we gotta stay friends, blood out, blood in
Sounds good to me, fuck it, what I got to lose?
Hmm, nothin' I can think of, any nigga would choose
Got me pushin' the whips, takin' trips across seas
Pockets stay laced, nigga, I floss G's
For that nigga I would bleed, give him my right hand
Now that I think about it… yo, that's my man!

[Chorus]
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?

[Verse 3]
You like how everything is goin'? You like what I gave ya?
You know if you was goin' down I'd be the one to save ya
But yo, I need a favor, these cats across town hate me
Plus their behavior hasn't been too good lately
What? Anything for you, dog, where them niggas at?
38th from Broadway, aight, let me get the Gat'
Run up on 'em strapped, bust off caps in four niggas
Laid low for 'bout a month then killed two more niggas
Now I'm ready to chill, but you still want me to kill
Look at what I did for you! Dog, come on, keep it real!
Aight, fuck it, I'ma do it, who is it this time?
Hey yo, remember that kid Sean you used to be with in '89?
Naw, that's my man! I thought I was your man?
But yo, that's my nigga! Hey, who's your biggest fan?
Either do it or give me your right hand, that's what you said
I see now ain't nothin' but trouble ahead

[Chorus]
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?

[Outro]
In the fog, the fog, livin' in the fog
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
How you gonna see him if you livin' in the fog?
The snake, the rat, the cat, the dog

331,Definition,Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star,Black Star,1998-09-29,206493,57,"

[Intro: Talib Kweli, Mos Def, & Sample]
Hello, everybody. Recording live from somewhere
Looooord... Lord have mercy
Black Star
All nice and decent crew
This is timeless! C'mon!
Follow me now, we say
Say, Hi-Tek, yes, you're ruling hip-hop
Put your hands up! C'mon, c'mon!
Say, J. Rawls, yes, you're ruling hip-hop
Put your hands up, everybody
Redefinition, say, you're ruling hip-hop
Put your hands up, c'mon
Say, Black Star, come to rock it non—

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate
The whole and not the half of it, forecast and aftermath of it
Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit
Me and Kweli close like Bethlehem and Nazareth
After this, you be pressing rewind on top your master disk
Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gathering
Connecting like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenements
'Cause all my Brooklyn residents, known as heavy regiments
Don't believe, here the evidence—where Brooklyn? (WHOA!)
See that? Bound to take it all, kid, believe that
From where they sell they tree at, to where the police be at
Talib Kweli, e-Kweli-ty, yo, tell 'em where we be at

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Brooklyn, New York City, where they paint murals of Biggie
In cash we trust, 'cause this ghetto fabulous life look pretty
What a pity—blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense
Tree scents is dominant, can't be covered with incense
My presence felt; my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection
People thinking MC is shorthand for misconception
Let me meditate, set it straight
Came to the conclusion that most of these cats is featherweight
Let me demonstrate:
Walking the streets is like battling; be careful with your body
You must know karate and think your soul is bulletproof like Sade
Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituaries
Third grade teacher reading and talking about, ""I knew he'd amount to nothing""
Neighbors like, ""He was the quiet type, who'd have thought they was fronting?""
Talking loud like you on RCA
Get carted away with body parts and trays
What a way to start your day, yo, it's like—

[Hook: Mos Def]
One, two, three (C'mon!)
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top (C'mon!)
Best alliance in hip-hop, Y-O
I said one, two, three
It's kinda dangerous to be a MC (C'mon!)
They shot 2Pac and Biggie
Too much violence in hip-hop, Y-O

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
I said Manhattan keep on making it, Brooklyn keep on taking it
So, relax, we're taking it back, Red Hook where we're living at
Plenty cats be struggling, not hustling and bubbling
It ain't about production, then—what is we discussing?
When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows
Striving for perfection ever since I was a snot-nose
Colossal! True, original b-boy apostle
Standing on the rooftop with the Zulu Gestapo

[Verse 4: Talib Kweli]
You think you the shit? Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or clique or some random kid you smoked buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry
Without a history of spitting the epitome of stupidity
Living my life, expressing my liberty, it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of equality
People follow me, and other cats they hear 'em flow
And assume I'm the real one with the lyrics like I'm Cyrano

[Verse 5: Mos Def]
Still sipping wishing well water imported from Pluto
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all the believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot precede us
In the jungle with the leaders, we them lions, you the cheetahs
Our cypher will complete us as we come through your receivers
You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us
(Line for line) Good Jesus! Mos Def and Kweli just
Make a pussy freeze up; think it over, ease up

[Hook: Mos Def]
One, two, three
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop, Y-O
I said one, two, three
It's kinda dangerous to be an MC
They shot 2Pac and Biggie
Hold your head when the beat drop, Y-O

""Hello Dr. Greenthumb, paging Dr. Greenthumb!""

(B-Real)
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
In the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields
The fucking pigs with shields holding the blue steels
Greenhouse effect with the weed connect
(Doctor) DEA can't keep Greenthumb in check (Doctor!)
HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
Or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growin without no permit
But fuck that, I study the 215 trip
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Chorus:
(B-Real) Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
(SenDog) Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
(B-Real) I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
(SenDog) Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
(B-Real) Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
(SenDog) Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
(B-Real) I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
(SenDog) Aiyyo Dr. Greenthumb, come on back one time!

(B-Real)
People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinkin and drivin and swervin
But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
In the backyard or inside with hydro
To the cush plant brushin a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowin a fuckin smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut groves
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood
Sticky angel, I neva wanna leave green alone
But never ever ever got a warrant for my home
What that funny sound knockin at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Chorus 1/2

(B-Real)
Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (taxi!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't wanna buy no weed from no cop
Get locked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growin my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growin like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb

Chorus

Dr. Greenthumb
Doctor, your Bulova plant needs special tending to
Doctor, we need more oxygen we need more CO2
Doctor, Dr. Greenthumb you're needed
Doctor, dahyahahahhh... Doctor

When you broke, you drove, ha
When you paid, you got beaucoup places to go, ha
You on top, ha
You rob a nigga shop, ha
You don't even think you can be stopped, ha
You ridin' in the Benz on twenty-inch rims, ha

[Chorus]
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remaining a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is you make nothin' out of somethin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'
You a paper chaser, you got your block on fire
Remaining a G until the moment you expire
You know what it is you make nothin' out of somethin'
You handle your biz and don't be cryin' and sufferin'

[Outro: Juvenile and (Mannie Fresh)]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
(Woodie) Woo, woo, woo!
(How do you love that?)
Nigga, nigga
Let's say you're at a DJ and them boys pullin' guns
You better run for it, run for it, run
You in the Magnolia and my people pullin' guns
You better run for it, run for it, run
Let's say you got 'em under the ropes and know the police about to come
You better run for it, run for it, run
Let's say you in the yard and them boys pullin' guns
You better run for it, run for it, run

I got my mind on foreign, but I'm swangin' marble grill
Gots to act real bad when I close red doors
I'm shootin' spiders off my rims 'cause I'm ridin' on fours
And niggas don't understand that we be drinkin' the norm
Never trust broads, they're frauds
On the 'vard is where I slang when I claim my name
Back in the game Herschelwood, Texas regained
It's the nine-eight and I'm jumpin in the mix
Rocks up on my wrists and got haters on my list

And some niggas act like they wanna pull a gat
But they betta watch out for the boy P-A-T
Ask them motherfuckin' haters can they handle me
'Cause I be so throwed in this game
Comin' down on the swang
Grip wood grain, on the shirt I leave a stain
'Cause you tryna jack a real true G
Comin' down the boulevard, can ya see me
Swang and I swang and I swang to the left
Pop my trunk and yep yep yep
Niggas betta see a nigga roll
Starched down and I'm rollin on 84s
It's the nigga F-A-T represent the clique
Right up in the bowl and a whole lotta shit
You betta look around 'cause they don't understand it
I'ma say, ""Hold up!"" and scream, ""God dammit!""
'Cause I'ma let the gat gone grip and gone take a trip
And if it's empty clip just throw it off the ship

336,Moment Of Truth,Moment Of Truth,Gang Starr,1998-03-31,247333,54,"

[Intro: Sharon]
No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth, baby

[Hook 1]
They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth

[Verse 1]
The same sheisty cats that you hang with and do your thang with Could set you up and wet you up nigga, peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although MC's lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize what I have done up to this point
So I'ma get more guys to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shinin', some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish jealous punks will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'Cause they love it to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is comin' to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth

[Hook 2]
Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you gotta dig deep when problems come near
Don't fear, things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin' is mad amazin'
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin' in my bedroom pacin'
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin'
Suicide? Nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinkin' or even gettin' high
'Cause all that's gonna do really is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit before
So I oughta be able to withstand some more
But I'm sweatin' though, my eyes are turnin' red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind, but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife and take the bullets out my 9
My only crime was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, rememberin' the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth

[Interlude]
You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!

[Verse 3]
Yo, I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one is pointed at your weak-ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger on these fully-loaded lines
You're gonna wish I would've pulled a black 9
I mack dimes, crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin' triflin' niggas and the studio pranksters
Yo, lookin' at the situation plainly: will you remain, G?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator with the greater data
Revolvin' on the TASCAM much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors
I explore more to expose the core
A lot of emcees act stupid to me
And we have yet to see if they can match our longevity
But anyway, it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Style's smooth but rugged, you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it 'cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone, my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin' your hideout, blockin' out your sunlight
Your image and your business were truly not done right
Throw up your He Allah Now Divine Saviours
You got no hand skills, there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top Benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
'Cause you must meet your moment of truth

[Hook 3]
They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
No one is untouchable, no man is bulletproof
We all must meet our moment of truth

337,Grand Finale,The Best Of DMX,DMX,2010-01-26,278013,48,"

[Intro: DMX]
I ain't going back to jail, next time that the county or the state see me, it's gon' be in a bag
Uh
This is it, baby
End of the road, ha-ha
When you a dog
You a dog for life
You don't hear me, though
You don't hear me, though
You don't hear me, though
Come on, come on

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Watch them young guns that take none
Nobody's safe from the Friday the 13th, ghetto Jason
Itchy trigger finger aching
Snatch your ass out that S-Class for faking
.44 blast, it's a bloodbath
Take your first step down a thug path
Ain't no love here, just slugs here
Kids know the half, you get plugged here
That's just impossible
For the weak to last, now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watching you, watching me
Throwing rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young G, we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
'Cause we family, for better or worse
You and I from the dirt
Used to snatch purses
So hard, it hurt to be here
And each year, I'm pouring out more beer
For deceased peers, holding fort
Police line, do not cross
They found his corpse in the loft
With the head cut off and butt naked
Homicide the crime method
Add another killer verse to the murder record
The grand finale

[Interlude: Nas]
Dogs for life
Who wanna test me?
Uh, dogs for life
Come on
Yeah, we dogs for life
Me shot, me shot pussy-hole people fi fun
Yeah, we dogs for life

[Verse 2: Nas]
Hot corners, cops with warrants, every block is boring
Friday night, getting bent, liquor pouring
My dog not even home a month yet
And blazed a girl in the stomach
He robbing niggas who pumping
Little Blood got popped by the group home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pulling they gats
Fiend yelling out, ""Who got those?""
Go and see, shorty snot-nosed
He don't floss, but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives running from court cases
Slugs shooting past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God will throw a beam of lightning down 'cause he feel us
May the next one strike me down if I'm not the realest
The mayor wanna call the S.W.A.T. team to come and kill us
But, dogs are friends
If one see the morgue, one will live get revenge
And we ride 'til the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn'
And still rise to collide with live men
My man got three six-to-eighteens, and only five in
The belly of the beast
Didn't wanna hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
It got us niggas from the hood hanging off its teeth
We slinging to eat, bringing the heat
Bullet holes, razor scars, it's the pain in the street, huh

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
When you a dog, you a dog for life (Ride or die)
My dogs feel pain, through love (See eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (Let us fly)
Come on, niggas (We dogs for life)
Yo, when you a dog, you a dog for life (Ride or die)
My dogs feel pain, through love (See eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (Let us fly)
Come on, niggas (We dogs for life)

[Interlude: DMX]
There's mad money out here, dog
Mad money out here
What you, trying to get it?
Word up
You gon' bust your gun to get it?
Psh, whatever, yo
Uh
I hear you, I hear you

[Verse 3: DMX]
I've lost my grip on reality, or so it would seem
Pinch myself to wake up, 'cause I know it's a dream
Niggas that don't know me see me and think I'ma rob 'em
Niggas that know me well see me and think I'm a problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to mans, I'll turn your last name to Underwood
'Cause if I see it, I'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on? That's D
The darker it gets outside, the more blood flows
When I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you
Drama, it's right here, how much you need?
Beat you down with gat, see how much you bleed
How much you plead for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches coming up out that ass, you feel it getting realer
Now, beg for your life, one more time
One more crime, one more nine
Come on, cry, nigga
It's over, this is the shit that ends all
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
When you a dog, you a dog for life (Ride or die)
My dogs feel pain, through love (See eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (Let us fly)
Come on, niggas (We dogs for life)
Yo, when you a dog, you a dog for life (Ride or die)
My dogs feel pain, through love (See eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (Let us fly)
Come on, niggas (We dogs for life)

[Intro]
""What'd you do last night?""
""We did, umm, two whole cars
It was me, Dez, and Mean Three, right?
And on the first car in small letters it said
'All you see is…' and then, you know
Big, big, you know, some block silver letters
That said 'crime in the city', right?""
""It just took up the whole car?""
""Yeah, yeah, it was a whole car and shit...""
Escúchela, la ciudad respirando
Escúchela, la ciudad respirando
Escúchela, la ciudad respirando
Escúchela...

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shinin', like ""Who on top of this?""
People was tusslin', arguin' and bustlin'
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustlin'
I'm wrestlin' with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seekin' what will transmit
The scribes can apply the transcript
Yo, this ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable, the indisputable (What?) We New York, the narcotics
Draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips for profits
Thirsty criminals sic pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working-class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living is preposterous
Stay alive? You pay or die, no options
No Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers
They both partners, they all heartless, with no conscience
Back streets stay darkened, while unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbin'
You either make your way or stay sobbin'
The shiny Apple is bruised, but sweet
And if you choose to eat, you could lose your teeth
Many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight the savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative grows to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance

[Chorus: Mos Def, all]
So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it, y'all! I can feel the city breathin'
Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evenin'
The sigh before we die like the last train leavin'

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Breathin' in deep city breaths, sittin' on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, Hell froze the night the city slept
The Beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin' with one another and ghetto birds
Where waters fall from the hydrants to the gutters
The Beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin'
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin' visibly shaken
Takin' them plungers
Plungin' to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure
Cats is playin' God, but havin' children by a lesser baby mother
But fuck it, we played against each other like puppets
Swearin' you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin' knowledge in jail like a blessin' in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flyin' away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everythin' is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin' it real will make you a casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like Mickey and Mallory
Not knowin' the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceein' to illustrate what we be seein'
Hard to be a spiritual being
When shit is shakin' what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm askin' if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose
'Cause New York niggas actin' spoiled at shows
To the winners, the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife, the Roman Empire state

[Chorus: Common, Mos Def, all]
So much on my mind, I just can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Yo, don't the bass ride out like an ancient mating call? 
I can't take it, y'all! I can feel the city breathin'
Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evenin'
The sigh before we die like the last train leavin'

[Spanish-speaking woman]
¡Escuchela... Respirando como yo… Ojos sinceros, escondiendo pena y temor… El silencio de mentira, tocando al hogar escapando sentimientos entre ella y yo…

[Verse 3: Common]
Yo, on The Amen, corner I stood lookin' at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin' down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to Heaven
In Hell, waitin' to exhale and make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold war; it's Chica-I-go for
What I know or what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib, I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome
Listenin' to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearin' down the 'jects, creatin' plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Asked my guy how he thought travelin' the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past Downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

[Chorus: Mos Def, Mos Def and Talib Kweli, all]
So much on my mind, I just can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night till she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Yo, how the bass ride out like an ancient mating call? 
I can't take it, y'all! I can feel the city breathin'
Chest heavin', against the flesh of the evenin'
Kiss the odds goodbye, I'm on the last train leavin'

I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down and boys wanna hate
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, don't make me pull out the choppa
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, I'll leave 'em on the streets dead
I chunk up the deuce for the south and the north
Boys talking down, I got them diamonds in my mouth

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Well it's that grain gripper from Houston, Tex
That barre sipper, that barre, no plex
I'm straight up outta that Swishahouse
Where G. Dash write all the checks
So check the neck, check the wrist
I'm balla status from head to toe
My jewelry shop sell more grills than George Foreman
Baby now you know
That ain't a igloo, that's my watch
And that ain't snow, baby that's my chain
That's not a ice tray, that's my teeth
And that's not a snow cone, that's my ring
That ain't Kool-Aid up in my cup
I stay sipping that purple oil
I stay flipping the slab on fours
'Cause I'm a hustler 'til I'm in the soil
My wrist game is one of a kind
Patek Philippe worth a 100K
My work schedule out on the block
It's mash all night and grind all day
No 401K for a hustler
Just bleed the block and stack that paper
M.O.B. when it comes to hoes
And a .40 cal when it comes to haters
We authentic playas not counterfeit
Got a 600 Benz with a fog kit
Got hoes at the HK turning tricks
Outrunning the track, trying to make me rich
I'm too legit to quit, stacking up that paper 'til I'm gone
So I'ma be working wood wheel and catching splinters
Riding twenty inches or better in chrome

[Hook: Lil Keke]

[Verse 2: Lil Keke]
Don Ke! Houston, Tex, got the streets burning
Popping seals with them fours turning
Rookie boys, they still learning
Losing cash, I'm still earning
Get my bread when I shake the fed
Keep them dimes in and out my bed
Jump in the drop to convert the top
And let 'em bop on candy red
Leather seats with that wood out
They don't know what my hood 'bout
Tryna take the young don's spot
I'm platinum balling and still hot
Haters off in my mix again
Pimping broads plus pimping pens
Multiplying, I gotta win
Keep that ice looking clear as gin
Out the roof still chunking deuce
Riding slab and hopping juice
Diamond grill with plenty of skills
Just pass the mic and I let it loose
Independent still chasing bucks
22s on Porsche trucks
Model chicks with them big ol' butts
Killer clans with them big ol' nuts
Hit the club with my game tight
Hoes bopping my fame right
Did her thang the same night
Boys talking, it's all hype
Cut the check when I run my mouth
Rolling in green like I'm playing golf
Texas boys be going off
Representing the north and south

[Hook: Lil Keke]

[Verse 3: Pimp C + Bun B]
I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, represent it 'til I'm dead
Pimping almost died in the 80s, boys was scared
Bitches was on crack, and the 'Lac wasn't rolling
But the game done been revived cause now the south side is holding
Pockets stay swollen, what do we do with all this cash?
Drive '84 Biarritz with TVs jumpin up out the dash
Pistol in the stash even though I'm on parole
Nigga try me Try me with that fuck shit, bitch I'll leave your body cold
From the land of grain, dripping paint, 84s and a chrome grill
This Texas baby, dirty south, P.A.T., you know we real
We pack the Ks, Desert Eags, ARs and them 38s
We serving nothing but Chyna Whyte, playa we don't sell that dirty weight
Big Bun Beater, hold it down, rep the town to the fullest
Whether it be on the mic or in the streets busting them bullets
Don't put it with me, I won't pull it on you and leave you ventilated
UGK is back on the block and you marks is finna hate it

So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim
And Adrock, light up the place
And if you pull my card, you pull the ace
And if you ask me, turn up the bass
And if you play defender
I could be your hyperspace... So

[Chorus]
Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'

[Outro]
""You will do eight hops on the left, eight on the right
Four left, four right, two left, two right, the one each
Left right, left right. Start and land on the balls of the feet
Left foot... Ready? It's one two three four five""

We're not dealin with the European standard of beauty tonight
Turn off the TV, put the magazine away
In the mirror tell me what you see
See the evidence of divine presence
Women in the, Caribbean, they got the, golden sun
I know women on the continent got it
Nigeria and Ghana, you know they got it
Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique
And Botswana, to let it speak
How 'bout Latinas, Colombianas
Cubanas, Dominicanas, Tahinians
Of course the Brooklyn women walk that walk
And the Bronx women walk that walk
Honies from Queens walk that walk
NYC, ATL, LA, Cincinnati, the Bay Area
Got the cocoa butter brown skinned ladies doing their thing in
London and Paris, cocoa butter brown sk...

342,My Name Is,The Slim Shady LP,Eminem,1999-02-23,268400,72,"

[Produced by Dr. Dre]

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady, you a basehead"" (Uh-uh)
""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole""

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

343,Nas Is Like,I Am...,Nas,1999-04-06,237026,64,"

[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro]
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like; Nas is like; Nas is like)
Umm, Premo, Nas
Yeah, yeah, yo
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like)

[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10s to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking it light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell (Nas, Nas, Nas)

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel (Uh, uh)
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 2]
(Nas is like) Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death, the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (C'mon)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 3]
(Nas is like) Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies
I'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh); Nas is like

[Intro: Redman]
(Oh my god)
Oh my god
Boo
Uh, uh, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Microphone checka, swingin' sword lecture
Closin' down the sector, supreme neck protector
Better warn 'em kid, Mr. Meth's a boiling pot
'Bout to blow his lid from the pressure, too hot for TV
For sheesy, too many wanna be hard, be easy
It's all N'together, going all out together
It don't take much to please me
Still homes, I'm never satisfied like the Stones
We don't condone bitin', see them skull and crossbones
Protecting what I'm writing
Don't clash with the Titan who blast with a license
To kill rap recitings
Come on, in the zone with ya nigga from the Group Home TICAL (Fuck your lifestyle)
Put your lights out
Get the shit to crackin', got you fiending with your pipes out
Time for some action
Surfin' the avenue, mad at you, where I used to battle crews
Back when Antoinette had that attitude
Cover me, I'm going in, walls closing in
Got us bustin' off these pistols, my niggas got issues
Again, same song armed with the mega bomb
Blow you out the frame and then I'm gone

[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo, I was gone too but we roam, cellular phones
Doc, Meth back in the flesh, blood and bones
Don't condone, spend bank loans on homegrown
Suckers break like Turbo and Ozone
When I grab the broom
Moon-walk platoon hawk, my goons bark
Leave you in a blue lagoon lost (True)
Three nines in the glove with Masu, D-Don and The Gov'
Right behind on a bus
Haters don't touch (What?)
Weigh us both up
Now my neighbor doped up
Got the cable hooked up
All channels, lift my shirt, all mammal
You ship off keys and we ship Grand Pianos
Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin' on a forty, yo, smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun, y'all, Red and Meth didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah, come on
Red and Meth didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' about, ""What's the reasons?""
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in and let's ride!
Check em out now, ride!
Ride!
Check em out now, ride!

[Chorus: JAY-Z]

Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's ""my scenario""
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!

Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it ""buck""
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise

On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughin' it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up!

[Chorus]
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known when I be on the mic
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known, yo
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known when I be on the mic
Hardcore, real ill niggas
So all hail the honorable

[Verse 1]
It's to my real ill niggas, heavyweight hitters
Dough-getters, fifty ways to make figures
My niggas that come on the spot to feel sisters
Like they hear real spitters and kids on the zigga-ziggas
When it's ugly, then the club is lovely
Thugs be sippin' Hennessey and bubbly
To my comrades that keep it flamin' hot
On dangerous blocks, claimin' spots
Where the goal is to be one of the top-ranked soldiers
Forty-five holders, one of the high rollers
Get respect in the hood, credit is good
Knock it down lumberjack style, baby; extra wood
Rock it all night long, the bang-a-thon, baby
Keep hangin' on, we like it with the lights on
Don't have to blow twenty thou' to get to know honey's style
Show her the town, steal her heart, no money down

[Chorus]
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known when I be on the mic
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known, yo
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known when I be on the mic
Hardcore, real ill niggas
So all hail the honorable

[Verse 2]
How about some hardcore? Yeah, we like it raw for sure
Broads on the floor, wall to wall
There's more at the door, players ball to score
‘Cause this right here is for all of y'all
Rakim and Premo; yo, I got what you need, bro
You go see a show, smokin' El Niño
And DJ's play hits with hard bass kicks
And then they display tricks like The Matrix
Make the record fly, undetected by the naked eye
So just feel the vibe, ‘cause your ears never lie
Nowadays DJ's bags of tricks, graphic
On some behind-the-back shit, catch it and scratch it
Blast it, this kid got his craft mastered
Hands is mad quick like he mix with magic
Spin it back and forth and grab it
And know just where it is… there it is

[Chorus]
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known when I be on the mic
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known, yo
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known when I be on the mic
Hardcore, real ill niggas
So all hail the honorable

[Verse 3]
To my elite peeps with the murderous mystiques
I hit the streets with beats and they critique for weeks
They be like: ""How that kid Ra reach the peak?""
Pull out the heat and use my technique to speak
It's dangerous, sit calm and explain to kids
What part of the game this is in foreign languages
They hold Ra's events in different continents
Put my lyrical contents in monuments
In ghetto garments, I rock a towel like a pharaoh
Mind travel, design style like apparel
My fashions last long as a lifetime
‘Cause I can see the future when the god write rhymes
They're mad ‘cause I managed to reign so long
Like their chance to get money done came and gone
This is strictly for my listeners on the corners at night
And the sisters that be keepin' us right, when I be on the mic

[Chorus]
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known when I be on the mic
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known, yo
Hardcore, real ill niggas
I'm internationally known when I be on the mic
Hardcore, real ill niggas
So all hail the honorable

[Verse 2: Erick Sermon]
Yo P!

Makin necks snap back, like a slingshot
E hustle, and muscle my way in
Then tussle for days in, on my own with guns blazin
Not for the fun of it, just for those who want me to run it
Then leave them like -- who done it?
Sucka duck, I do what I feel right now
When I spit the illest shit, cats be like, ""Wow!""

Hands on the steel, flip you heads over heel *sniff*
Smell the daffodils from the lyric overkill *sniff*

In Japan they call me Ichiban
Wu-Tang Clan, numba won!

Pop close range at foes, and blaze them hoes
Leave em with they brains exposed, and stains on clothes
Y'all better change your flows, hear how Luck spittin?
Stay drunk-pissed in the S-Type, stay whippin *screech*
When the guns spittin, duck or get hittin
It's written, we in the game but ball different
Point game like Jordan, y'all play the role of Pippen
Style switchin, like tight ass after stickin
MAN LISTEN, stop your cryin and your bitchin
Like E and P's last CD, you're out of business

[Chorus]
Get the fuck up
Simon says, ""Get the fuck up""
Throw your hands in the sky (Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
Queens is in the back sipping 'gnac, y'all, what's up?
Girls, rub on your titties (Yeah)
Yeah, I said it, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

[Verse 1]
Y'all know the name (Uh)
Pharoahe fuckin' Monch, ain't a damn thing changed (Uh)
You all up in ya Range and shit, inebriated (Uh-huh)
Strayed from your original plan, you deviated
I alleviated the pain with long-term goals
Took my underground loot, without the gold
You sold Platinum 'round the world, I sold wood in the hood
But when I'm in the street and shit, it's all good
I'm soon to motivate a room, control the game like Tomb Raider
Rock, clock dollars, flip tips like a waiter
Block shots, style's greater, let my lyrics anoint
If you holding up the wall, then you missin' the point

[Chorus]
Get the fuck up
Simon says, ""Get the fuck up""
Put your hands to the sky (Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
Brooklyn in the back shooting craps now, what's up?
Girlies, rub on your titties (Yeah)
Yeah, fuck it, I said rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

[Verse 2]
Yo, where you at? (Yo, where you at?) Uptown, let me see 'em
Notorious for the six-fives and the BMs
Heads give you beef, you put 'em in the mausoleum
And shit don't start pumping 'til after 12 p.m. 
Uh, ignorant minds, I free 'em
If you tired of the same old everyday, you will agree I'm
The most obligated, hard and R-rated
Slated to be the best, I must confess, the star made it
Some might even say this song is sexist-es
'Cause I asked the girls to rub on their breast-eses
Whether you're riding the train or a Lexus-es
This is for either or Rollies or Timex-eses
Wicked like Exorcist, this is the joint
You holding up the wall then you missing the point

[Chorus]
Get the fuck up
Simon says, ""Get the fuck up""
Throw your hands in the sky (Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
The Bronx is in the back shooting craps now, what's up?
Girls, rub on your titties (Yeah)
I said, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

[Intro]
[Erick Sermon] Latest record? You stole it from somebody else
[Redman] Takin' it from the top?
[Erick Sermon] Hell yeah, we takin' it from the top
[Redman] Tippy? All my people
[Method Man] Sing it, daddy
[Redman] Hey, uh

Fly Robin Fly...Fly Robin Fly...Fly Robin Fly...Up, up to the sky

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocketful a rye
Who the fuck wanna die for their culture
Stalk the dead body like a vulture
Ticallion, HMMM
Blacker than your blackest stallion
Hit your housing projects
I represent yo Shaolin my nigga
Hell yes, Apocalypse Now, the gun blaow
It be goin down, diggy diggy down, diggy down down

[Verse 2: Redman]
While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
When I raise my trigger finger all y'all niggas hit the deck
'Cause ain't no need for that, hustlers and hardcore
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs
The Green-Eyed Bandit can't stand it
With more Fruitier Loops then that Toucan Sam bitch
Plus, the Bombazee got me wide...
(Messin' with them) is a straight suicide

[Chorus: Method Man, Redman, Erick Sermon]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
(It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' (lah) on the train)
How high? (So high that I can kiss the sky)
(""Up, up to the sky"")
(Yeah, check it out y'all)
(Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane)
Recognize Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
(How high?) So high that I can kiss the sky
(""Up, up to the sky"")
(Yeah, yeah, Tical)

[Verse 3: Method Man]
10 9 8 7 6 5 4
3 2 Murder 1 lyric at your door
Tical bring it to that ass raw
Breaking all the rules like glass jaws
Nigga, you got to get mine to get yours
Fucka, we don't need no rap tour
I'd rather kick the facts and catch you with the rap-ture
More than you bargained for
Tical, that stays open like an all night store
For real, I keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
And end your existence, M-E-T
Ain't no use for resistance, H-O-D

[Verse 4: Redman, Method Man]
I's be the ultimate rush to any nigga on dust
The Egyptian musk used to have me pull mad sluts
I shift like a clutch with the Ruck
Examine my nuts, I don't stop 'til I get enough
Yo shit broke down, light your flair
Since the dark side tears you into Hollywood Squares
Six million ways to die, so I chose
Made it six million and one with your eyes closed
The blindfold, cold, so you can feel the wrath
And shatter the glass and second half on your monkey ass
Ayo my man (Tical) hear me now
Bitches used to play me now they can't forget me now
Forget me not, I rock the spot, check Glock
Empty off a lickin' off in hip-hop
Fuck the Billboard, I'm a bullet on my block
How you dope when you paid for your Billboard spot?

[Chorus: Method Man, Redman, Erick Sermon]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
(It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' (lah) on the train)
How high? (So high that I can kiss the sky)
(""Up, up to the sky"")
(Yeah, yeah, ha, word up)

[Verse 5: Method Man]
As I run a mile with a racist
My style was born in the pissy staircases
Dig it, eff a rap critic
He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt, I'm the second one to hit it

[Verse 6: Redman]
Look up in the, I got the verbs, nouns and Glocks in ya
Enter the center, lyrics bang like Rico-chet Rabbit
I bring havoc with an A-K matic
Rollin blunts an all day habit
I get it on like Smiff and Wess'
Who click's the best?
Punks take a sip and test
Who splits your vest?
The funk phenomenon
I'm bombin' you like Lebanon
Flow canals of Panama just off stamina

[Chorus: Method Man, Redman, Erick Sermon]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
(It's the Funk Doctor Spock smokin' (lah) on the train)
How high? (So high that I can kiss the sky)
(""Up, up to the sky"")
(Yeah, ha, ha, yeah, yeah)
(Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane)
Recognize Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed

Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane

[Produced by Jeff Bass]

[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, a-get yo' hands in the air
And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth
Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O, the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er-

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', ""Fuck the world"" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed

OutKast and Slick, the answer is in it
Hon you need to get your ass on the dancefloor this minute
We bruise stuff, knock you out shoes, socks
Show your ass, move your fuck out, we're mad smoove snots
La-Di-Da-Di, mmmmm we like to party
Don't make me get money and platinumize my body
With bright stuff, known to earn a dyke's love
Blind folks be like, ""Somebody turn the lights off""
Immense rep, poppin out a muffin
Make famous artists that's dead hop out a coffin
At the real estate, behavin type choosy
Want a palace with the shit beige and light blue please
Got the kid like ""watch your manners""
Since I came out of jail, it's like the planet gone bananas
Lack of strength a badder fella had
Lady lookin at me all stink, I had to tell her that

We some of the dopest MC's out there
Now eat that, OutKast and Ricky D, bitch, can you beat that?
Remember the time I laid them down to Teenage Love?
Now see that
Just to sport a rhyme and break in new patterns like hymens
Shuckin' and jivin' was never the style
I'm gon' keep on being this lion
Spittin' that king shit, you cling shit
A tailor and a seamstress
Blue gators for you haters and the penis for all you beatches
Like an addiction 'cause I need it, hip-hop is that I fiend it
Like a junkie, show me your monkey, 'cause I sho' nuff like to beat it
Might just eat it just to skeet it
Fold you up like you was pleated
Like some slacks and, relaxin', be strollin' like Sir-Captain
See, I got a, baby daughter, and I feed her with this rappin'
Not trappin', d-boy, but rappin', huh, yeah, yeah

Down South, barbecue ribs fly out a nigga mouth
And touchin' me The Chosen, for such a will opposin

Smokin' love—do we provide dope enough?
Even people unborn kid wide open off
The enginin' I'm sendin' in
Even make construction workers start actin kind of feminine (Hi)
10%'ll blast this hit from me and Big Boi

Last time you saw that nigga

No more deaths
'Cause in a minute you gon' have grandma bein'
The only family member left (Come on)

[Verse 3]
Look at all these off-brand niggas (Uh-huh)
Runnin' around yappin' 'bout
They be holdin' figures as big as Jigga's (Come on)
That's that bullshit
Don't they know that around me
Talkin' about what you got will get you hit (Uh)
I'm not a nice person
I mean, I'd smack the shit out you twice, dog
And that's before I start cursin'
I stay flippin'
One minute, I'm cool, the next minute
I'm up on a nigga, rippin'
That's my style
I'm a cruddy nigga, leave you all bloody, nigga
Service with a smile (Uh-huh)
Suck my dick
And all you niggas that been to jail before
Know that it's about to get thick (What)
Let's get it on, baby
You gon' be goin' against four niggas in one
And you think you crazy? (Alright)
I've lost my mind
And I'm about to make you lose yours, too
From far away, one time (Boom)

[Intro]
Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check, one-two, we recordin'?

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

[Chorus]
Now, follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then OD
Now, don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it

[Chorus]
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me

[Intro: Method Man]
All day everyday with this rap soufflé say WHAAAAT?
Situation be like this

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Traces of lipstick on my collar
Baby you gotta do some more to get this last dollar
Hotter than lava when you cum believe that I'mma follow
Lady Madonna like to drink but she don't like to swallow
Rockin that Prada, honey stay up in the beauty parlor
Girl it would be my honor, make you my baby momma
Holla she hella proper
Fuck with it dumbin cousin, sucker for lovin buggin
Shuckin and duckin buckin, suckin then finger-fuckin

Pushin yo' panic button when I'm stuck in
All of a sudden, baby conductin (BBC!) Ooh girl you nasty

[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo, I get it on poppin, Doc, unlockin your doors
Glock in my drawers sock in your mouth with a torn stockin
Wrapped around a noggin, I creep in while you park it
Shoot out the lights, darken the area, then hop in
Pick up my bigga nigga who helped me figure the plottin
Droppin the top, splittin the dough, shoppin in rotten
New York, birds flockin because I'm heavy like boats
Doc in coat, watch ya coat from fo' sparkin
Dearly departin, niggas, unforgettable can't be forgotten
Doc and Meth album enterin the top ten
Choppin the raw, lockin the block and
Only raw choppin this metaphor, so cops can stop watchin
I put em in and cock em, ready to Rock'Em Sock'Em
Renovate your apartment, when these two things barkin
My Nakamichi knockin, bougie holes be spottin
On they tampons, I get em drippin like leaky faucets

[Chorus: Redman, Method Man]

[Verse 3: Redman]
I figured it out: y'all niggas ain't as big as your mouth
My street value - well it won't even fit in your couch
When I bust titties come out, no matter what city
Hardcore committee's dumb the fuck out -- son should duck out!
Yo, nuttin to lose, pumpin the two up in your goose
Buckle your shoes, scuffle my boots, fuckin witchu
Blow my anaconda like Nirvana
Marijuana got bitches on they knees in they Gabbanas
Gettin em dirty dirty with the Hershey and enbalmin
Holla the drama, fire two in ya armor, your pigeon betta calm her
The ice is a honor, twin help me lift her arm up
La Bamba witcha momma, even dirty Hadonna
My dick is aeronomic, pull out and yell Geroni-mo
PPC! Ooh girl you nasty

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Itchin to start the mission, flippin so keep yo' distance
Ain't go no pot to piss in? Ain't got no competition
Listen, I slip the clip in, trippin you get me lippin?
Commence to catch a whippin, now kids is actin different
Ditchin them double-dippin, chickens that keep forgettin
I ain't the one for trickin on anybody kitten
Rippin these compositions, scriptin them paper-writtens
Holdin and hittin stickin, ballin like Scottie Pippen
It's hot in Hell's Kitchen, but still I'm frostbitten
Shittin like ""No he didn't,"" wipin my ass and splittin
Jett'n like Joan gettin, all in the zone
Settin' it off like Big Daddy and ain't no half-steppin'
I keep reppin -- Staten, you keep sweatin
Threaten and ass-bettin, duckin my Smith and Wessun
Trust in the Meth and catch-in-Hell
Will leave you restin in PEACE, (PPC!) Ooh girl you nasty

Aiyyo my song's on, I gotta get my grub on some to-to
(I love to-to) Order three buckets of Mo'-Mo'
We gettin' more dough, off the books (you gettin' jelly)
Pullin more hoes off the looks (you gettin' jelly)
You wan' hate me? Cause your wifey, wants a autograph?
From the look in her eyes, I can see she wants more than that
When I see fat asses I make fat passes like quarterback
Beatnuts is ALLA THAT, your shit, ALL THE WACK
Open can-dela, if you foolin' wit my cheddah
Hardrock, ever since, junior high escuela
Fly fella, takin my beats, to make your crowd get up
I'm fed up, niggas wanna bring it -- WHATEVER!
I'mma storm your pa-rade (pa-rade) blow your legs off
With a gre-nade, now you flappin', like a mermaid
Yappin off, bitch you cough at the lips
While I'm at the bar, baggin', the bartender tips
Then I bag this chick, with a, ""Hi,"" and the eye
She did the butterfly, rubbin' her ass, against my buttonfly
I could already imagine my shit stuck inside
Everytime I strike, haters be like, ""Dat fucking guy!""

[Chorus: Beatnuts + Yellaklaw]
How's that yo? It's hard for you to swallow
It don't take much for us to let the metal holla
Lead's bustin out of a old black Impala
Thug nigga only fuck wit, muchacha malla
Big Ju, dimelo el coño, how we do?, how we do? (How we do)
(How the girl don't only love me, they love you!)
Whatchu gonna do? (What, what, what?)
Nigga whatchu gonna do? (What, yo)

[JuJu]
Here's to my pollyin' niggas who campaign
To the killers who be lovin' the chicas and champagne
Thugs who get wild in the club and snatch chains
Players who be pimpin' the hoes with no brains
Front watch a nigga get shot from close range
The most range, crazy motherfucker won't change
Beatnuts, forever diehard, you want pain?
Cause you walkin' outta here breathin' is insane
Flip a beat fast, you leave the club with a heat rash
You got a weak stash, came in the club with a free pass
I ain't even know they made a Roley for your cheap ass
Makin me laugh, you was in jail wearin' kneepads
Now the beef has gotten over your head
It's over you dead, Ranger Rover, both of your legs
Till both of us said, platinum gettin' took this year
Cause for real, there ain't nothin' but crooks in here, nigga

[Chorus]
How's that yo? It's hard for you to swallow
It don't take much for us to let the metal holla
Lead's bustin out of a old black Impala
Thug nigga only fuck wit, muchacha malla
Big Ju, dimelo el coño, how we do?, how we do? (How we do)
(How the girl don't only love me, they love you!)
Whatchu gonna do? (What, what, what?)
Whatcha gon' do when Beatnuts come through baby!

[Intro: Rakim]
Aiyo, what's goin' on?
The mic Lebanon teflon don
I'm back, baby
The year of the 9's
And I'ma have make these motherfuckers an offer they can't refuse
You know?

[Verse 1]
Ha, what's goin' on? Yo, c'mon, you know it's on
I wrote a song, test my flow on the Autobahn
Make sure the force is right, I floss all night
Get off the mic, it'll smoke like an exhaust pipe
Keep 'em in the library, studyin' my theory
Ra theory get translated in Swahili
From the lands as far as Zanzibar
They understand the R, the man Allah
It's obvious why the copiers, they copy this
Soon as my data processes Y2K, they floppy disk
Now, who the hottest is? How can it not be this?
Baby, who the cockiest? Papi is? Gracias
Aiyyo, this be so, magnifico
Even my typical style difficult
Make a crowd go wild when I rip a show
Better stand back, this'll blow, you didn't know?

[Hook]
They show me love when I'm come through
Yo, any club that I come to
I hit a microphone, check one-two
And they know what I wanna do - flow forever!

[Verse 2]
You ever witness rapport like this before?
It's 'cause y'all kiss the floor, say Bismillah
It's the chosen one with the golden tongue
Flow for the old and young when I'm holdin' one
In the front row sitty, we show no pity
Where kids get jiggy and girls are so pretty
The Wanderer, back from Casablanca
To stomp all, what next for Ra to conquer?
So let's go, the best show will explode
No dress codes, they just pose in they best clothes
Girls get exposed when I show my rap expo
Will there be a next episode? I guess so
Those that have doubt, wanted to have clout
What they mad about? Must be a cash drought
MC's switch they style from they last bout
And I bet soon as they hear this, they spaz out

[Hook]
They show me love when I'm come through
Yo, any club that I come to
I hit a microphone, check one-two
And they know what I wanna do - flow forever!

[Verse 3]
Wherever Rakim go, it's the God tempo
It's simple, my M.O. - no problemo
Been all over the map, even know where Hell is at
I get the welcome mat, and then welcome back
My flow is raw, they treat me like Mr. Know-It-All
They want me to show 'em all my brand new protocol
Excusez-moi, I make 'em move for Ra
You ain't soupin' Ra, save the hoop-a-la
Let me find out you rhymed out, designed out
Pullin' dimes out to climb out for time-out
I'm at the free throw, playin' ball, or cee-lo, I keep dough
Reloaded like Carlito, incognito
I be so low-key, women get nosy
I do a show, they wanna go see to get to know me
In the front row seat, they cosy
Thinkin' I'm givin' 'em the bo-bo-vee until they O.D

[Hook x4]
They show me love when I'm come through
Yo, any club that I come to
I hit a microphone, check one-two
And they know what I wanna do - flow forever!

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

[Verse 1: Redman]
It's Funk Doc, where the weed at, bitch?
I speed backwards down a one-way from cops, see that shit?
Believe that shit, slaughter straight to camcorder
I'm “Too Hot for TV”, rap draw water
My windpipe's attached to project boilers
You yell: “Turn the heat down!”
My voice DVD 'round sound so I'm heard round town
The chances are y'all leaving 'round now
Wait later, we'll make front page paper
Date raper with juvenile eighth graders
Hit the high school and 187 Caesar
When I bust y'all need to back four acres
Doc y'all and that's my man, Jabberjaw
The shitlist ready, who next to scratch off?
I'm from the underground, my sound lift
Platform shoes to bitches, 400 pounds

[Chorus: Method Man & Redman]
Get up, stand up, back up, push up (Come on)
Jump up, act up to make y'all feel it
Br-r-r-r-r stick 'em, ha-ha-ha stick 'em
Br-r-r-r-r stick 'em, ha-ha-ha stick 'em
Yo, blackout, shootout, smoked out, move out (Come on)
Even knock your tooth out to make y'all feel it
Br-r-r-r-r stick 'em, ha-ha-ha stick 'em
Br-r-r-r-r stick 'em, ha-ha-ha stick 'em

[Verse 2: Method Man]
And I'm the street talking, dog walking
Approach me with extreme caution
Oh now you forcing my hand to rock your cradle often
I'm hot scorching but stone cold like Steve Austin
If you smell what Tical cookin'
Ain't tryna see central bookin', so tell ya goon stop lookin'
Know what you did last summer, so I started hookin'
You past shooken off an open can of ass-whoopin'
Ain't no tomorrows in the Method's little shop of horrors
Go ask your father who the father from the hill to harbor
You know the saga, marijuana blunts and Goldschlager
With deadly medley, y'all ain't ready for Shakwon and Reggie
Don't even bother, to radio for back-up (Back-up), alright then
Your man got slapped up, extorted for his ice an'
Street life is triflin', “Body over here!”
Don't make me pull a Tyson and bite a nigga ear
Precise and slicing jugulars, the cutthroat
Ruggeder, predator, viking, etc
People's Champ, niggas be taking on competitors
Reaching for the microphone, relax and light a bone
Straight from the catacomb, the “Children of the Corn”
That don't got a clue, prepare for Desert Storm

[Chorus: Method Man & Redman]
Get up, stand up, back up, push up (Come on)
Jump up, act up to make y'all feel it
Br-r-r-r-r stick 'em, ha-ha-ha stick 'em
Br-r-r-r-r stick 'em, ha-ha-ha stick 'em
Yo, blackout, shootout, smoked out, move out (Come on)
Even knock your tooth out to make y'all feel it
Br-r-r-r-r stick 'em, ha-ha-ha stick 'em
Br-r-r-r-r stick 'em, ha-ha-ha stick 'em

[Verse 3: Redman & Method Man]
I scored 1.1 on my SAT
And still push a whip with a right and left AC
Gorilla, Big Dog, if my name get called
I'm behind the brick wall with arsenic jaws
Spit poison, got a gun permit draw
Gun down at sundown, you keep score
This training course and y'all ain't fit
On my crew tombstone put, “We all ain't shit!”
Yo, all you gonnabe, wannabe, when will you learn?
Wanna be Doc and Meth? Gotta wait your turn
I spit a .41 revolver on New Year's Eve
With the mic in my hand, I mutilate MCs
The most slept on since Rip Van Wink', my shit stink
With every element from A to zinc so what you think
I'ma blackout on just one drink? You must be crazy
A little off the wall maybe, go get a shrink

[Chorus: Method Man & Redman]
Get up, stand up, back up, push up (Come on)
Jump up, act up to make y'all feel it

Uh huh yea, yeah

You gotta let it bump
Uh, uh, uh like dat yeah
Come on bring the chorus in

[Chorus: Sample]
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
My brother from another pop, minus one shot
We Nino and Gee Money, man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we're young execs
My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Ty
My nigga High, my nigga Gotti
We embody all that’s right with the world
No matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl
That's how we run, when you ain’t around
I'll spank ya son, keep him in line
If you should die, I’ll keep him like mine
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga

Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I know Momma, your little baby
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom, for your wisdom, for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
""Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them""
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was wheezin'
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn’t the life meant for you
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that’s mine

[Chorus: Sample]
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Check it out, uh, uh
Dear nephews, I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
The world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores
Don't listen to your crew, do what works for you
Standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
You know my number when it’s code red
If you're wrong, my nigga
You're my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga

[Chorus: Sample]
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you

360,High As Hell,It's A Beautiful Thing,Keith Murray,1999-01-07,201600,47,"

(Phase one)

I grab the Henny and twist the top
Guzzle it that's when the reaction starts
I split the chalk with the dutch
Had the hash in the greenery, then the L get sparked
Keith Murray's never smokin' on babbith
Niggas give me dirt and I throw it in the garbage
Actual facts, writin exact, sacks of African Black
I smoke two back to back
I smoke so much I choke out fire alarms
With the towel under the door feel the effect of the bar
Put Visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Looked in the mirror, said to myself yo you high as hell
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
Inahle it through your mouth, freeze like you froze
Then *blowing sound*, blow it out yo nose

[Chorus]
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM

(Phase 2)

Me and the Funk Doctor Spot up top on the hop
Block two big jig hot shots coppin mots
Seasons slice precise, ice 'n' tights
Chickenheads that circle the block twice
If you chokin then pass cuz it's not a game
Bitches hit my blunts and never feel the same
They start actin strange and kinda erotic
I try to tell her you ain't nothin bout no chronic
Ahh drats I think I'll take a long walk
And light a fat one up for the sergeant general of New York
Who determine gettin lifted kill brain cells maybe
If it wasn't for weed, niggas would be goin crazy
So smell it from afar, comin from the bar
Or rushin out when I open up the car door
Whether home or party in a bag or a jar
Put that lah in the air and represent what is stand for

[Chorus]
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM

(Phase 3)

I'm not sayin I'ma a pothead, cuz I'm not
I'm just sayin that I smoke alot
Catch me in V.I.P. smokin with Dennis Scott
Or after the show in the parkin lot
I only buy weed from a selective few
Cuz niggas is wicked and they will get you
I ran outta blunts got some paper from your mother
She had extra weed so we rolled another
No doubt, I hear you out
Before I roll my L, I think the cancer part out
I'm uptight cuz I missed the buddah stop before the flight
And damn we gon be away for like 12 nights
So here I am in Amsterdam gettin high again
You know what, come to think of it, yo, I'll have a Heineken
Inhale it through your mouth, freeze like you froze
Then *blowing sound* blow it out yo nose

[Chorus]
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke of the tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke of the tram
Get 3-Dimensional luck like CD--
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
I don't give a fuck so you can go to hell

[Outro]
We smoke it up y'all, we smoke it up y'all, we smoke it up y'all
Get lifted uh uh
Y'all know what time it is
Yo R, light that L

361,Waiting For The World To End,The Master,Rakim,1999-01-01,245026,46,"

[Intro]
Yeah
It's the God Rakim
Word up, I'm blazin' this out to all my comrades
Ya know I mean?
From the slums of New York, to the gutters all over the world
This is for y'all

[Verse 1]
Through my travels, I try to take righteous steps
Because right or left could mean life or death
No matter how trife it get, my sights is set
But it's twice the threat when the nights is death
My mental windows refuse to close, they get exposed
To the neighborhood info where the poison wind blows
A deadly plague spreadin' negativity, viciously
Unto every city be in ghetto misery
Don't let it get to me, the writer be left to die
But it get mesmerize if it catch your eye
Shine's enormous, from jewellery, vehicles and garments
But it's torment, jealousy, drug wars or warrents
Tallyin', slowly turnin' into barbarians
More scary when the whole boulevard's carryin'
Livin' in the world of sin, my ghetto girls and men
Waitin' for the world to end

[Hook]
""Tryin' to paint a perfect picture and excel""
""In case you didn't know""
""Never movin' backwards""
""Complicated""
""Know what I mean?""
""Tryin' to paint a perfect picture and excel""
""In case you didn't know""
""Never movin' backwards""
""Complicated""
""Know what I mean?""

[Verse 2]
I see destruction, even little kids trust none
They bust guns, that's what they get a rush from
When I see 'em, we build and have a real discussion
""Yo Ra, what's the jewel of the day?"" ""What up, son?""
""You got ambition?"" Shorty said, ""Man, listen
I got demands for livin', can't stand division
Make grands on my mission, 'til everythin' glisten
Women in the Expedition, no plans for prison
In a vision the city get, two milleni, G
Sittin' in my embassy, sippin' Hennesy
Gettin' high, and watch life pass me by""
So I asked him why, with a fast reply
He said, ""I'm livin' just to die without any feelings
So I wait here for my maker 'til it's time to go
With this dime I know, with all of her girls and all of my men
Waitin' for the world to end""

[Hook]
""Tryin' to paint a perfect picture and excel""
""In case you didn't know""
""Never movin' backwards""
""Complicated""
""Know what I mean?""
""Tryin' to paint a perfect picture and excel""
""In case you didn't know""
""Never movin' backwards""
""Complicated""

[Verse 3]
Shorty was taught to keep his head to the sky, and never cry
But the streets left him to die, now it's death in his eye
Livin' in sin'll give men a sinister grin
From the beginnin' to end, in it to win
Evil rebels, doin' what we do in the ghetto
Thinkin' if we was thorough we could deceive the devil
You can't win, your life'll end, try again
Shorty said, ""Why we born again to die again?""
That's what I said when I realized I had a gift
To uplift and be one of Allah's advocates
Teach the youth and speak the truth
Show 'em what peace can do when they'll reach for you
And my reward won't be jewels or cheese, it's even better
I can be one of the greatest MC's ever
If I tell 'em they intelligent women and great men
And live, stop waitin' for the world to end

[Hook]
""Tryin' to paint a perfect picture and excel""
""In case you didn't know""
""Never movin' backwards""
""Complicated""
""Know what I mean?""
""I'm ragin', rippin' up the stage an'
Don't it sound amazin', know what I mean?""
""Don't it sound amazin', know what I mean?""

[Produced by J Dilla]

[Intro]
To all the lowriders, and big-riders
Lowride, what happened in the car yo
F'real, let a nigga

[Verse 1]
Brand new Truck, butter soft seats
4-point-something with a low ridin something
Ain't nothing better than to ride out the hood with it
Who looking better and damn you looking good in it
Take a chance with a nigga in the choice ride
Listen to the CD's I play inside
Mos Def, Jay, Prince and Stevie
Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin and Biggie
And when the evening is over, love
Gonna find a nice spot for the Rover, love
Do things to make the man in the moon blush
My mind race but I tell my waist don't rush
You's a upper echelon piece
So when you find there's a stash then you don't freak
You wanna nibble on a nigga ear
And do all the things that make a nigga wanna get near
Oh, I'm a Queens representative
Get wild by any means my incentive is
When we done, I start it up again
And ride round with you ,cause you my special friend

[Hook]
Me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on

[Verse 2]
The second part, my ride is like art
We get creative in it when we take it out and spin it
The backseat is the canvas we painting on
Abstract the word we creating on
The TV's in the back and the dash too
Got miss napkins and bamboo
Don't worry, the tints passed the legal one
Outkast's banging loud in my eardrum
The way the wheels spin cutting through the still wind
Outsiders looking in with the ill grin
Fuel injected, brand new inspected
Emissions got tested, details perfected
Got the Armor All touch, empty out the dutch
No tobacco spilling on my rug, klutz
Kick off your shoes, show off your pedicure
Shake off the blues, we all for getting more
More of that thing
Stuff that brings ecstasy making you cling
A little harder than your average hug or grab
Lady tell me this is better than taking a cab
And when you bounce, tell all your girls
You rode around hot-wheeling, drinking, no earl
Vacationing, V up my V8
Just one night we drive and we escape

[Hook]
Me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on

Me and you I think we should ride
Come on come on come on come on
Don't worry just done get inside
Come on come on come on come on

[Intro]
On a Warm San Franciscan Night
On a warm San Franciscan

[Verse 1]
Knight
Lord Radio and Hale Bop on the Bay Bridge faded
Trying to find Smiley's house, thank God we made it
Yo, blunts, broads and beats, keep it low through the streets
And niggas givin' us pounds cause of these dope-ass sounds
We run aground like ships, over these beats I flip
The bass is hittin' so hard that your CD skips
Well check it out, make sure it doesn't happen again
I got my grip on it, so turn it up to volume ten
Volume 10, word, like that brother from L.A
Lord Radio and Hale Bop mean streakin' through the Bay
We all-city like the Mayor, you see my name
On more fresh shit than Creed Taylor
The G for international ladies like a sailor
Like a sailor I get drunk and bust flows to the beat
Like my man J, I feel the Agony in Defeat
Cause sucka-chumps wanna test and step like we don't know
We doin', we doin' shows in San Francisco
That's right young writer, got a hit for all you biters
Time to bless another track we getting rid of the whack
We put em in the back with the other Tappan Zee shit
Beats hit hard, make the trolly do ollie
Old folks grabs their collies and vacate the Bay
See a name in Northern Lights, Thes Love and Double K
We getting wild for the night, we getting wild for the night
And it all went down, what, what

On A Warm San Franciscan Night
Yo, rocking shows for you and your crew
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
We rollin' blunts and doin' the do
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
We doin shows with a mic check a one two
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
P.U.T.S is on a bad foot coming through
On A Warm San Franciscan Night

[Verse 2]
We was drinking, smoking, more smoking, more drinking
Didn't think about the morning hangover, just didn't want to be sober
Yo Radio, tell me how did you feel
Like I'll never catch a DUI, hit gas
Peel, make a left on Market, yo Mister Double K
Ay, ay what's up
Roll up the windows and spark it
Done deal, yo, you didn't have to ask twice
Just park on the top of the hill, so we can peep the city lights
I'm on award tour, we got it locked like Alcatraz
Doin the San Francisco show like Hubert Laws
CTI 7071 go buy it
Bring the drums like Harvey Mason don't try it
Better look next time, trying step the P
You in the Bay, punk, I guess you ain't heard about L.A
Yo Double K, tell 'em that the P's unique with the beats
P.U.T.S shows, a San Francisco treats
A San Francisco treat just like some Rice-A-Roni
Put it in your mouth and let it run down the middle just like Monie
Phony homey, you never rock a party
Your whack-ass crew gets called out
See I play the rod-roddy come on down
To the south-land punks, smell' the concrete
Have you askin' questions from ya' head to your feet
You don't want none of this shit that I'm offering
Sayin that the P can't rock your city, (what)
Fool you measure for a coffin
Very often we win, yo, very seldom we lose
Spice rockin' there mother-fuckin whole city

On A Warm San Franciscan Night
Yo, rollin' blunts and doin the do (the do, the do)
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
Chillin' with your girl and her crew (her crew, her crew)
On A Warm San Franciscan Night
Scaring old people, still doin' the do (we're doin' the do)

Yeah, making collect calls into another area code, we mowed
We be the P.U.T, 310, we be the main extension I be the Double K
And we crowning, downing, 40 ounces, vodka, whatever, juice, ludes
San Francisco here we come, we're coming back we gonna have a gun
Pow, pow ,pow ,pow
Much love to the Bay Area
P-U-T-S

Rockin' the discos, startin' a fight

364,Guilty Conscience,The Slim Shady LP,Eminem,1999-02-23,199333,62,"

[Intro: Mark Avery & Eddie]
Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

[Skit: Stan, Girl]
Come on, just come in here for a minute
I don't know
Look, look, look
Damn
Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay
Look, give me a kiss, pull your pants off, come on

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

[Interlude: The Isley Brothers, Mark Avery, (Grady), & Grady's Wife]
Here I lay
(Man, it feels good to be home)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

Slowly I turn, step by step, through the back window I crept
Silent as a mouse on the set while everybody in the house slept
I disconnect the phones and the rest
Find a butcher knife, cut the power lines to the lights
Now a nigga wild for the night
I come like the livin dead, straight from the dirt
Back to avenge his own death on this Earth
Ever hear of Jason, then you know my work
Down to the basement, the dog get it first
I can't help myself, my thoughts ain't my own
The voices in my head just won't leave me alone
Murda murda murda, kill kill kill
Pissing on the car seats, flattening the wheels
So there's no escape from the fate that awaits
No one to witness the horror taking place
Yeah, now I'm on my way up the stairs
To the bedroom of my prey unaware
Heads will be hung from the chimney with care
With hopes that the police soon will be here
I'm a killer

Eye Witness News, Channel 7
We are at the scene of a horrific crime ladies and gentlemen
I can't describe it right now

And eight fingers, to square with Joe Young
Tongue below one, spit dumb, moron
For whiteboys to snowboard on
So What 'Cha What 'Cha What 'Cha Want
Chew Spearmint gum, two double pump
Two cannons, piece by piece
Your School get Dazed like G Phi G

They sell drugs for ice for the Benz with bug lights
Some hug mics to the world, hung like parasites
But life's lethal, and might mislead you
A sneak preview, watch what we do and what the hood teach you
I still see through the eye of a needle
So I can watch people
Because love backwards is evil

[Hook: Sample]
""Levantaré""

[Verse 2]
Yo, what's this? Yo bust this. Yo it's time to uplift
They think all we do is bust clips and puff splifs
And plush whips and clutch chips and touch chicks
Flont rocks like Fort Knox and hawk blocks
Taunt cops with more props and we want not
Panhandling with your mans and them
Scrambling, gambling, plans to win
While the cops clock em, fiends flock em
Women watch em, traders wanna top em
Ay yo what's the problem
Before the narcs knock em obviously playas plot to rob em
The ghetto got em, my man said it's rough at the bottom

[Hook: Sample]
""Levantaré""

[Verse 3]
Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
We went from 1st to America's worst
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth
Let's form plots with one another, and call shots
From 12:00 til the next ball drop
All year around cause we suffer non stop
You think it's rough at the bottom, it's even rougher on top
My peeps gonna have to reach and turn for me
And everybody's side of the street'll be sunny
Ain't nothing funny, burn plenty of firm honeys
And earn money and watch the century turn 20

[Hook: Sample]
""Levantaré""

[Verse 4]
We all should, from the woods to the big city and the small hood
Everybody should be welcome to the ball if we all could
But we fall cause we brawl, yo it ain't all good
We need to play right, stay tight with ya air alight
Keep your game tight, no need to play trife
Get cheese from the daylight to the late night
And it's shouldn't take death to appreciate life
Before a lot parish, we got to cherish if Allah let us
Get proper nourish 'till the block flourish
In this metropolis, stay on top of this
You know what the prophet is, be prosperous

[Hook: Sample]
""Levantaré""

[Verse 5]
Now we networking
Respect the next person, it'll be less hurting
Or left lurkin, while we kept our dreads working
Connect set for certain, total networking
Last chance to advance and stash grands
If you have plans to have fam and mad land
Own shine, condone crime or hold 9s
I know what the problem is, killing our own kind
To my flame throwers, train sober, remain soldiers
Stay sane so these pretty dames can hold us
Terror terrain rollers and Range Rovers so the train goers
Claim your fame, maintain, till your game's over

[Hook: Sample]
""Levantaré""

[Verse 6]
Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
We went from 1st to America's worst
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth
There's more prize for one another, and call shots
12:00 til the next ball drop
All year around plus they shuffle non stop
You think it's rough at the bottom, it's even rougher on top
My peeps gonna have to reach and turn for me
And everybody's side of the street'll be sunny
Ain't nothing funny, burn plenty and burn money
And earn money and watch the century turn 20

368,One More Road To Cross,...And Then There Was X,DMX,1999-12-21,260426,50,"

[Intro]
Uh
This is life (This is life)
This is what I know (This what I know)
So to me (So to me)
This is life (This is life)

[Chorus]
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make

[Verse 1]
I'm up at like 6 AM to check this nigga (Uh-huh)
He work the nightshift and I gots to check them figures (A'ight)
Knock on his door, peoples talkin' 'bout he ain't there
But the house is packed, shit, I know he here somewhere
See, money get high, I don't knock what a nigga do to get by
Just make sure you gettin' by don't fuck with you gettin' mine
Ain't the first time he ran off, shoulda split his shit then
Hate to think of what he's did and if I catch him slippin'
Won't be an ass-whippin', I can tell you that
I keep it real with this cat, he go and sell two packs
And run off (Damn), tell me he was locked down up North
And you out a week later? That's bullshit, I bust off
I need this dough, fuck you think, I'm here for my health?
I need this wealth because I feed myself
You play with my life when you play with my money
Played around, but this'll be the last time you think something's funny

[Chorus]
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make

[Verse 2]
Yo, I've been casin' the liquor store for a month now
But me and two other niggas
Is about to run up in there and shut it down
They got four people on the inside, one stay in the back
Two stock boys, one at the register, but he count the stacks
A'ight, bitch, put on the ski mask
Make sure that when we ask
For the dough, they know that we takin' all three bags
Now see that? We got a hero, shoot that nigga
Matter of fact, you hit the back, I'll put two in that nigga
Hard-head motherfuckers always get it
I told him what would happen if he moved
The nigga moved, so I did it (A'ight)
""Did you get it?"" I asked my man as he was comin' from the back
Nigga opened his mouth, said nothin' and fell out flat
This cat come out spittin', hittin' my mans, his mans
Couldn't control what was in his hands
I'm hit, damn, I bust back and got the fuck up outta there
Didn't get a dime, but at least I got up outta there

[Chorus]
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make

[Verse 3]
Ayo, I see it, try to avoid it, but it comes
That's how it's goin' in the slums over crumbs (What)
Somethin' little becomes somethin' major (Uh-huh)
Niggas gettin' blown up like a pager
Ear to ear with the razor (What)
Pour out my soul, took control of hurt
Why must Earl Simmons swim in dirt?
I'm gon' make it work, twenty-eight and tryna get baptized
Priest scared to touch me 'cause he said I gave him bad vibes
Ride when I die, straight down, but I'm plottin'
We all gots to go, but who wants to be forgotten?
I'ma leave a mark and it won't be the mark of the devil
Throw dirt and may your hands burn when you touch the shovel
The level of animosity is stoppin' me from thrivin'
Fuck what them niggas is talkin' about, I'm survivin'
Alive and goin' through it, but I made my bed
So now it's in these flames that I lay my head

[Chorus]
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make

[Hook]
I speak the truth
Truth, nothin but the truth
Y'all know what I bring to the game I speak the truth
The truth, nothing but the truth

[Verse 1: Beanie Mac]
I hope you got an extra mic and a fire proof booth
Cuz you know I'm known to melt a wire or two
You need a fire engineer when I lay this blaze
I melt down cracks that's real to save
Hit the studio, jars of dro, bars to blow
B. Sigel with that arsenic flow
Fuck that, don't hold me back
I roll with crack, y'all cats told Mac to rap
Y'all don't realize y'all released the beast untame
Speech all flame, streets y'all blame
It should be an honor for y'all to speak my name
I could go before your honor sit and peep my game
Gotta laugh, y'all acted like it spit it the same
Why you motherfuckers can't get in the game
I come from high school, and go straight to the league
Who you know who can spit at the Sig

[Hook]
Nigga the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth

[Verse 2: Beanie Mac]
Ain't nothin changed with Sig I'm still stuck in the kitchen
So what I'm signed, that's fine still stuck in position
You motherfuckers know me well, couple court cases from jail
Couple 4-4 shells from hell
Stuck on this mission, go home, my girl fussin and bitchin
Motherfucker won't you change your life, I'm thinkin
Motherfucker won't I change my wife
Ignorant bastard laughin like fuck the rap shit
It's just another hustle, another way for niggas to touch you
Now they know the face of Beans
Now they, see my face on screens and I ain't even chase this dream
I feel sorry for those who did
Y'all niggas can't stop the BOL, whether rock or raw
I'm slingin coke in a Roc velour
You niggas know what block I'm on, Glock in palm
You wanna get shot, karate chopped or stabbed this song
Motherfucker

[Hook]
Nigga the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth

[Verse 3: Beanie Mac]
Black Friday management, and Roc's the label
And I still hit you niggas with shots that's fatal
That bullshit vest can't save you
I had a doc open you up from chest to navel
See my face on cable, and have flashbacks of that cold ass table
And them hoes I gave you
I'm that nigga that'll come and pour salt in your wound
At the hospital, while the cops guardin your room
You gotta see what I've seen, look where I've looked
Touch what I've reached, and take what I've took
You gotta go where I've gone, walked where I've walked
To get where I'm at to speak what I've talked
You gotta lay where I've laid, stay where I've stayed
Play where I've played to make what I've made
You gotta move what I've moved, use what I used
Use tools how I use, use fools how I use

[Hook]
Nigga the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth

370,You Got Me,Things Fall Apart,The Roots,1999-02-23,259306,65,"

[Chorus x2: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building, on the same floor
And never met before until I'm overseas on tour
And peeped this Ethiopian queen from Philly takin' classes abroad
She studyin' film and photo; flash, focus, record
Said she workin' on a flick, and could my clique do the score?
She said she loved my show in Paris at Élysée Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like, ""That shit don't matter"", when I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not? Think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Tellin' me the things I'm tellin' her is makin' her hot
Started buildin' with her constantly 'round-the-clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep tellin' me…

[Chorus x2: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 2: Black Thought + Eve]
Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some old…
Another lonely night
Seem like I'm on the side, you only lovin' your mic
I know you gotta get that paper, daddy, keep that shit tight
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politickin' with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty—psych
I'm playin', boo, you know it's just with you I'm stayin', boo
And when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes, I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin' on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin' to your homies, they be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you sayin'? I can trust you?
Is you crazy?! You my king, for real
But sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt...

[Chorus x2: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whisperin', ""She tryin' to play you for the fool, Black""
If something's on your chest, then let it be known
See, I'm not your every-five-minutes-all-on-the-phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some ""Oh, I'm a celebrity!""
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listenin' to they squads and listenin' to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like…

[Chorus x5: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or...

371,Rock Bottom,The Slim Shady LP,Eminem,1999-02-23,214093,55,"

[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Intro]
Ayo, this song is dedicated
To all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 2]
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

[Verse 3]
There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup)
But it's the evil that made me
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

[Chorus]
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom

You got a little cars, little jewelries
But none of y'all muh'fuckers could fool with me
You know the wrist frostbit minus two degrees
'Bout as blue as the sea, the way I maneuver the V
Hat cocked can't see his eyes, who could it be?
With that new blue Yankee on, who but me?
Niggas shipped two million, then I blew to three
Then I skated to four, 'fore I went on tour
I came back and it's plain, y'all niggas ain't rappin' the same
Fuck the flow, y'all jackin' our slang

Three cuts in your eyebrows tryin' to wild out
The game is ours, we'll never foul out

[Intro: Female Voice]
(Now it's time for our wrap up
Let's give it everything we've got
Ready? Begin)

[Verse: Gift of Gab]
Artificial amateurs aren't at all amazing
Analytically, I assault, animate things
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Canceling cats, got their canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily doin' dough
Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low
Eating other editors with each and every energetic
Epileptic episode, elevated etiquette
Furious, fat, fabulous, fantastic
Flurries of funk felt, feeding the fanatics
Gift got great, global goods gone glorious
Gettin' godly in his game with the goriest
Hit 'em high, hella hype, historical
Hey holocaust hymns
Hear 'em holler at your homeboy
Imitators idolize, I intimidate
In an instant, I'll rise in an irate state
Juiced on my jams like Jheri curls jocking joints
Justly, it's just me, writing my journals
Kindly I'm kindling all kinds of ink on
Karate kick-type Brits in my kingdom
Let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery
My mind makes marvelous moves, masses
Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered
Niggas nap knowing I'm nice, naturally
Knack, never lack, make noise nationally
Operation, opposition, off, not optional
Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals
Perfected poem, powerful punchlines
Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet, it's Quannum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got-uh
Really raw raps, risin' up rapidly
Riding the rushing radioactivity
Super scientifical sound search sought
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Tales ten times talented, too tough
Take that, challengers, get a tune up
Universal, unique, untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice lord victorious valid
Violate vibes that are vain make 'em vanish
Why in my world would a wise wordsmith just
Weaving up words, weeded up on my workshift
Xerox my X-radiation holes extra large
X-height letters and xylophone tones
Yellow-back, yak mouth, young ones' yaws
Yesterday's lawn yardsale, I yawn
Zig-Zag zombies, zooming to the zenith
Zero in, Zen thoughts, overzealous rhyme
Zealots!

[Intro]
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
It is not a fuckin' game (You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play)
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
If it's fuck me, nigga, you know it's fuck you

[Verse 1]
I kick it to shorty to try to help him understand (Uh)
Hit him with work, 'cause yo, that's my little man (Uh-huh)
He asked a few questions 'bout the game and I told him (Yeah)
So when he made a bad move, it was my place to scold him (A'ight)
Never told him nothin' wrong, kept it fair
Didn't listen, so I might as well have been talkin' to the air (Damn)
Everybody makes mistakes, a mistake is a'ight
But if it ain't, I'ma tell you straight, time to say goodnight
Nobody likes to be played, regardless of the relationship
But shorty's fuckin' up big time, I hate this shit I'm caught in the middle of havin' love for a lil nigga
And knowin' what's expected of me as a real nigga (Damn)
My next move is crucial, what do I do?
How do I keep it real with shorty and my crew?
Didn't wanna kill him, so instead of puttin' the MAC on him
I did the only thing I could do, turn my back on him

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me, nigga, then you know it's fuck you

[Verse 2]
Niggas that I fuck with wanna get him dead
But I'm cool with shorty's peoples, so I let him live
Under normal circumstances, he would be a marked man
But I hit him with a grand, just didn't shake his hand (Ooh)
Go about your business (Uh-huh), do what you gon' do (Uh)
Be what you gon' be, I wash my hands, I'm through (A'ight)
I can forgive, I just can't forget
You're on your own, little man, don't ask me for shit (No)
If you paid attention to what I taught you, then you good (Uh)
If I see you again, get it, understood?
Go 'head before I change my mind 'cause you know you should be dead
""I just wanted to say—,"" ah, go ahead
Instinct told me to kill him, but the savior is
I'm a good nigga, plus I owed his peeps a favor (Mmm)
But I also knew the decision I just made (Yeah)
Went against the rules of the game that we play (Damn)

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me, nigga, then you know it's fuck you

[Verse 3]
I should've followed my first instinct 'cause I knew (Right)
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do (True)
Now this nigga's fuckin' with the competition (What)
Ungrateful motherfucker, should've got him missin' (What)
This nigga got the nerve to take my kindness for a weakness
Gots to get back on some street shit so I can creep this
Rat, when I act, take one, set him up
Take two, get him there, take three, get him done
Wasn't hard for me to get him where I wanted him, confronted him
Bzzt, click, there was a bullet in one of them
Feelin' lucky? Click, looks like you are
Click-click-click, luck ain't goin' too far (Uh)
What you did was put on another pair of shoes
And they just happened to be too big
What you did was stupid (Damn), real fuckin' stupid (A'ight)
Well, shorty, I gave you a chance and what did you do?
Threw it back in my fuckin' face, so fuck you too (A'ight)

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me, nigga, then you know it's fuck you
Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me, nigga, then you know it's fuck you

375,Things That U Do,Volume. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter,JAY-Z,1999-12-28,292400,37,"

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Uh-huh, uh
Jigga Man, uh-huh MC
That's right
Swizz Beatz
Uh, uh, come on

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)]
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain
(Uh)
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, bounce)
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain (Yeah)
I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You know the flow sicker, know Jigga, mo' sicker now right
You know what me and Swizz's shit sound like
Crazed and demonic, uh, without blazin' chronic
Product of Reaganomics
You know that motherfuckin' stoop raised me
Ringin' in the hoops but I was too lazy
School made me sick, teachers said I was too crazy
Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z
Let me explain this to you, baby
I spent nights out, days in
Niggas was blazing
Twelve noon where I was raised in
I felt caged in but kept roaming
Prayed for the Day of Atonement
Married to the streets no date of annulment
It seems every time it comes up, they postpone it
So I kept my chrome at the waist, waiting for the omen
Savoring the moment and now you know
The reason that I flow the way I flow, baby

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)]
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain
(Uh)
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, bounce)
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Exhale breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain (Yeah)
I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You know I move like an ounce
Bottled up like crack
That's how I make you bounce like that
Defy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that
That's why no other rapper got a sound like that
Trap, trap of my life
Flashback, kill niggas
Rap skills unmatched, Jigga Man baby
I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it
God given, guess it was all for hard living
Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom
Could've been lost in the system
Instead I'm involved with the rhythm
I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions
I know I must be part of some mission
Shit, I used take it for granted
Why they placed me on this planet
I would ask myself while writin' raps to myself
But right there under my nose
Was the flow of all flows
Not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)]
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Come on, inhale, exhale, breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain
(Uh)
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, bounce)
It's the things that you do
That make me feel so
(Exhale breathe on it for me)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can't explain (Yeah)
I love you
(Uh come on)
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
You know I've traveled through zones
Homes spazzed like a bad back
I came into this game on Jaz's back
I jumped off stood on my own two like boom, that's that
Yeah I'm here to show and prove
Don't matter to me the Garden or flowin' on Clue
Whatever niggas wanna do - it's alright with me
Whether you big or bossy, jig or flossy
Dusty or musty, sober or saucy
Broker than Todd Bridges, richer than Bill Cosby
Forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty?
Past on to the next life and you still haunt me
I'ma keep doing me unfortunately
I make the club rock, make thugs pop guns
Make old folks do the bus stop; can't stop son
Shit I give you what's hot and what's not, I never knew
Y'all (niggas) know (niggas) how (niggas) do

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Jay-Z)]
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
(Uh, exhale, inhale)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can explain
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Uh, bounce, shake, what? uh-huh)
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
(Uh-huh, inhale, exhale)
And I don't know the way I feel I can explain
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Bounce, shake ladies)
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
(Uh-huh, breathe for me, uh, uh-huh)
And I don't know the way I feel
I can explain
(Uh)
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
(Lights out niggas)
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
And I don't know the way I feel I can explain
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
And I don't know the way I feel I can explain
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
It's the things that you do that make me feel so
And I don't know the way I feel I can explain
I love you
You thug you, look what you make the clubs do
