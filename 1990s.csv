[Intro]
I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom!
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
I will not give you up (Freedom!)
Gotta have some faith in the sound
(You got to give what you take)
It's the one good thing that I've got, (Freedom!)
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
So please don't give me up (Freedom!)
Cause I would really, really love to stick around (You got to give what you take)

[Verse 2]
Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy
What a kick, just a buddy and me
(What a kick, just a buddy and me)
We had every big-shot goodtime band on the run, boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race, got out of the place
Went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don’t think that I’ll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
I will not give you up, (Freedom!)
Gotta have some faith in the sound
(You got to give what you take)
It's the one good thing that I've got (Freedom!)
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
So please don't give me up (Freedom!)
Cause I would really, really love to stick around (You got to give what you take)

[Bridge]
Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last
That's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing your mind
And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom! (Oh!)
Freedom!
(My) Freedom!
You got to give what you take!
Freedom!
I'll hold on to my (Freedom!)
My (Freedom!)
You got to give what you take! (You got to give what, to give what, to give what you take!)

[Outro]
Yeah!
You got to give what, to give what, to give
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live

[Verse 1]
The night seems to fade
But the moonlight lingers on
There are wonders for everyone
The stars shine so bright
But they're fading after dawn
There is magic in Kingston Town

[Bridge]
Oh, Kingston Town
The place I long to be
If I had the whole world
I would give it away
Just to see the girls at play

[Verse 2]
And when I am king
Surely I would need a queen
And a palace and everything, yeah
And now I am king
And my queen will come at dawn
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town

4,The King of Wishful Thinking,Indian Summer,Go West,1992-11-14,241760,63,"

[Verse 1:]
I don't need to fall at your feet
Just cause you cut me to the bone
And I won't miss
The way that you kiss me
We were never carved in stone

If I don't listen
To the talk of the town
Then maybe I can fool myself

[Chorus:]
I'll get over you
I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking

And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
I am the king of wishful thinking

[Verse 2:]
I refuse to give in to my blues
That's not how it's going to be
And I deny the tears in my eyes
I don't want to let you see
No
That you have made a hole in my heart
And now I've got to fool myself

[Chorus:]
I'll get over you
I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking

And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking

I'll get over you
I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking

[Bridge:]
I will never, never
Shed a tear for you
I'll get over you
If I don't listen to the talk of the town
Then maybe I can fool myself

[Chorus:]
I'll get over you
I know I will
I'll pretend my ship's not sinking
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
I'm the king of wishful thinking

I'll get over you
I know I will
You made a hole in my heart
But I won't shed a tear for you
I'll be the king of wishful thinking

I'll get over you
I'll pretend my heart's still beating
Cause I've got no more tears for you
I'm the king of wishful thinking

I'll get over you
I know I will
You made a hole in my heart
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you
Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking

5,All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You,Brigade,Heart,1990-03-25,310893,66,"

It was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said, ""Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can""

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too

All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew

[Verse 1]
Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
The boy could sing
Knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more
He'd leave you longing for

Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

[Verse 2]
Up in Memphis
The music's like a heatwave
White lightning
Bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl
""Love Me Tender"" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

[Pre-Chorus]
The way he moved
It was a sin
So sweet and true
Always wanting more
He'd leave you longing for

[Chorus]
Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

[Bridge]
Every word of every song
That he sang was for you
In a flash, he was gone
It happened so soon
What could you do?

[Chorus]
Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Black velvet
And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees

[Outro]
Black velvet if you please
If you please
If you please
If you please

You told me I'd never leave you baby
But I don't believe this is happening all over again

I was such a fool
To think that you would ever change your ways
Even put your hand upon your heart
And said that no-one else can take my place
How was I so blind
I trusted every single word you said
I know I should have seen the light
But I just let your love go to my head

Ive taken you back before 'cause you told me you've changed
Looked in my eyes and said

Believe me, then you
Broke my heart and deceived me, when you
Said you never could leave me
But its happening all over again (no, no, no)

I promised to myself
I'd never make the same mistakes again (same mistakes)
And though I looked for someone else
I never really want to walk away

It seems that your just the same, I forgot all the pain
Look in your eyes, you said

Believe me, then you
Broke my heart and deceived me, when you
Said you never could leave me
But its happening all over again
But its happening all over again
(You said believe me)
But its happening all over again
(Deceived me)
But its happening all over again

But its happening all over again
But its happening all over again

I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me
Release me, release me

[Verse 3]
I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing
Though very slow
So stop coming around my door
'Cause you're not gonna find what you're looking for

[Chorus]
Ohh, come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
Somehow it's just not that easy
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me

[Bridge]
Now tell me
What is this power you've got on me?
What is this power? Ohh

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me

[Outro]
Release me, release me
Release me, will you release me?
Ahh, release me
Release me, will you release me?

[Verse 1]
Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (Life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor
And here's what it's for, so

Hey, hey, hey

All you need is your own imagination
So use it that's what it's for (That's what it's for)
Go inside, for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door (Open up the door)
It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it will give you new life
You're a superstar
Yes, that's what you are, you know it

14,Sit Down,Gold Mother,James,1990,244866,63,"

[Verse 1]
I'll sing myself to sleep
A song from the darkest hour
Secrets I can't keep inside of the day
Swing from high to lean
Extremes of sweet and sour
Hope that God exists
I hope, I pray
Drawn by the undertow
My life is out of control
I believe this wave will bear my weight
So let it flow

[Chorus]
Oh, sit down, oh, sit down, oh, sit down
Sit down next to me
Sit down, down, down, down, down
In sympathy

[Verse 2]
I'm relieved to hear
That you've been to some far out places
It's hard to carry on
When you feel all alone
Now I've swung back down again
It's worse than it was before
If I hadn't seen such riches
I could live with being poor

[Chorus]
Oh, sit down, oh, sit down, oh, sit down
Sit down next to me
Sit down, down, down, down, down
In sympathy

[Bridge]
Those who feel the breath of sadness
Sit down next to me
Those who find they're touched by madness
Sit down next to me
Those who find themselves ridiculous
Sit down next to me
In love and fear and hate and tears
In love and fear and hate and tears
In love and fear and hate and tears
In love and fear and hate...
Down
Down

[Chorus]
Oh, sit down, oh, sit down, oh, sit down
Sit down next to me
Sit down, down, down, down, down
In sympathy
Oh, sit down, oh, sit down, oh, sit down
Sit down next to me
Sit down, down, down, down, down
In sympathy

[Verse 1]
I need a little time to think it over
I need a little space just on my own
I need a little time to find my freedom
I need a little...

[Counter-Verse 1]
Funny how quick the milk turns sour
Isn't it, isn't it?
Your face has been looking like that for hours
Hasn't it, hasn't it?
Promises, promises turn to dust
Wedding bells just turn to rust
Trust into mistrust...

[Verse 2]
I need a little room to find myself
I need a little space to work it out
I need a little room all alone
I need a little...

[Counter-Verse 2]
You need a little room for your big head
Don't you, don't you?
You need a little space for a thousand beds
Won't you, won't you?
Lips that promise, fear the worst
Tongue so sharp, the bubble burst
Just into unjust...

[Verse 3]
I've had a little time to find the truth
Now I've had a little room to check what's wrong
I've had a little time, and I still love you
I've had a little...

[Counter-Verse 3]
You had a little time and you had a little fun
Didn't ya, didn't you?
While you had yours, do you think I had none
Do you, do ya?
The freedom that you wanted bad
Is yours for good, I hope you're glad
Sad into unsad...

[Verse 4]
I had a little time to think it over
Had a little room to work it out
I found a little courage to call it off
I've had a little time...

[Outro] x3
I've had a little time...

[Verse 1]
All the lonely nights, I spend alone
Never around to love me, you're always gone
Cause you're hanging out, breaking the rules
Oh, the man has come looking for you
You're a rebel now, don't give a damn
Always carrying on with the gang
I'm trying to tell you, boy, it's a mistake
You won't realize 'til it's too late

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

[Chorus]
Black cat, nine lives, short days, long nights
Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

[Verse 2]
You're so together, boy but just at a glance
You'll do anything if given a chance
Scheming, planning lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep
Don't you tell yourself that it's okay
Sick and tired of all of your games
And you want me to stay, ah, better change
Makes no sense to me, your crazy ways

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Not afraid to die

Man, I don't understand your ways
Living on the edge

Don't understand why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time, you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies

Living on the edge, not afraid to die
Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

Heartbeat, real strong but not for long
Better watch your step or you're gonna die

I'm M.C. Kat on the rap so mic it
Here's a little story and you're sure to like it
Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool
With my home girl, Paula Abdul

[Verse 1: Paula Abdul & The Wild Pair]
Baby, it seems we never ever agree
You like the movies and I like TV
I take things serious and you take 'em light
I go to bed early and I party all night

[Verse 2: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
Our friends are sayin' we ain't gonna last
'Cause I move slowly and baby, I'm fast
I like it quiet and I love to shout
But when we get together, it just all works out

[Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

[Verse 3: Paula Abdul & The Wild Pair]
Who'd-a thought we could be lovers?
She makes the bed and he steals the covers
She likes it neat and he makes a mess
I take it easy, baby, I get obsessed

[Verse 4: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
She's got the money and he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes and I like to smoke
Things in common? There just ain't a one!
But when we get together, we have nothin' but fun

[Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract
A two steps forward, a two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

[Breakdown: Paul Abdul and The Wild Pair]
You know it, baby, baby
We come together
We come together

[Verse 5: Paula Abdul & The Wild Pair]
Baby, ain't it somethin' how we lasted this long?
You and me provin' everyone wrong
Don't think we'll ever get our differences patched
Don't really matter 'cause we're perfectly matched

[Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact

A two steps forward, a two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

Two steps forward, two steps back
Two steps back

Yo VIP, let's kick it

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, baby
Ice, ice, baby

[Verse 1]
Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with a brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
""Will it ever stop?"" Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, huh, and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance, rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit the bullseye, the kid don't play
And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby

[Verse 2]
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burnin' them if you're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin'
In my 5.0
With the rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
“Did you stop?” No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots raged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Chorus]
Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Ice, ice, baby

[Verse 3]
Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, “Damn!”
If rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Chorus]
Ice ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Ice ice, baby
Vanilla Ice

[Outro]
Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)

From a distance
The world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance
The ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

From a distance
There is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope
It's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

From a distance
We all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed
From a Distance
We are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope
Playing songs of peace
They are the songs of every man

God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us
From a distance

From a distance
You look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance
I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for
From a distance
There is harmony
And it echoes through the land
And it's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man

It's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
This is the song of every man

God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us

[Verse 1]
You can reach me by railway
You can reach me by trail-way
You can reach me on an airplane
You can reach me with your mind
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can

You can reach me by sailboat
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down slow, into these arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt
Cross the border in a blaze of hope
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can

There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, then surely you would be closer
I need you closer

(Musical break)
There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
If I had my way, then surely you would be closer
I need you closer

You can windsurf into my life
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon
But you better make it soon
You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here, just get here if you can

I don't care, I don't care, I need you right here right now
I need you right here, right now, right by my side
Yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't care how you get here, just- get here if you can

And right now... right now... right now it's time to...
Kick out the JAMS motherfuckers!

The lyrics'll flow, yo -- for the words I speak
Rap is weak so I teach and I reach
A positive vibe, a way of life is how I'm livin'
So get hype to the rhythm

Design a rhyme I just won't fear
Back to react, enough is enough
Let me ask you a question -- What Time Is Love?
What time is love?

When I'm done, this calls for anesthetic
Get to, step to, let an MC
Come in effect with Kingboy D

A feat, a dream, a-yeah seem bright

28,Praying for Time,Ladies And Gentlemen... The Best Of George Michael,George Michael,1998-11-09,281333,43,"

These are the days of the open hand, they will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man, whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor, and most of us are not sure
If we have too much, but we'll take our chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way he must have let us all out to play
Turned his back, and all god's children crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand, oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man, your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say ""What's mine is mine and not yours""
I may have too much but i'll take my chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time

29,I Promised Myself,Move Until We Fly,Nick Kamen,1990,240773,61,"

I promised myself
I promised I'd wait for you
The midnight hour
I know you'll shine on through
I promised myself

I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers
You made my dreams come true

How many of us out there
Feel the need to run
And look for shelter?

I promised myself
That I'd say a prayer for you
A brand new tomorrow
Where all you wish comes true

I promised myself
That I'd make it up to you
My sister and brother
Know I'm in love with you

How many of us out there
Feel the pain of losing
What was once there?

God I know what people
Say about her
No mistake who can live
Without love

In the midnight hour
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait for you

30,Where Does My Heart Beat Now,Unison,Céline Dion,1990-08-10,272866,51,"

[Verse 1]
So much to believe in, we were lost in time
Everything I needed
I feel in your eyes
Always thought of keeping
Your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave
Without a trace
Where do silent hearts go

[Chorus]
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

[Verse 2]
Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder
Come and rescue me
Driven by hunger
Of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go

[Chorus]
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

[Verse 3]
Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

[Chorus]
Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night?
Where does my heart beat now?
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go?

[Bridge]
I've got someone to give my heart to
Feel it getting stronger and stronger
And stronger
And I feel inside

[Outro]
Hearts are made to last
Until the end of time

It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns

Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through

And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all

In no time you'll be fine
Don't worry...

You met a guy he said he was your lover
He said he loved you like no other
Told you that you were the only one
How could he say that when he's having so much fun
Now he says you're making him said
How he says that when he treats you so bad
Now he's gone left you for another
You're not the first you now discover

Don't you cry you'll get by you'll be back
On your feet in no time you'll be fine don't worry
You got hurt you got heard you're not the first
Your heart aches it won't last it will pass don't worry

Don't waste your time thinking of the past
Love like that it could never last girl
Don't you know things happen for a reason
It's meant to be just like the change of seasons
You're not to blame don't you feel so bad
He was the one who was making you sad
Now he's gone left you for another
It's for the best you will discover

Don't you cry you'll get by you'll be back
On your feet in no time you'll be fine don't worry
You got hurt you got heard you're not the first
Your heart aches it won't last it will pass don't worry
Don't worry don't worry

Standing all on my own love will never be the same without him
Trying hard to be strong how can I go on now he's gone

Don't worry… don't worry…

Don't you cry you'll get by you'll be back
On your feet in no time you'll be fine don't worry
You got hurt you got heard you're not the first
Your heart aches it won't last it will pass don't worry

Don't you cry you'll get by you'll be back
On your feet in no time you'll be fine don't worry
You got hurt you got heard you're not the first

Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

[Bridge]
I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

[Verse 3]
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be

Miss Brixton queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream
Telling me lies when the truth was clear

Spinning around
Like a wheel on fire
Walking the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escaping me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you

Holding you's just like a dream
Love is never what it seems

And you're holding me the way you feel

You make my dreams come true

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you

She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back
But she goes too far
Winding me up just to let me down

So emotional
Gagged and bound
There's more to this than meets the eye

A devil woman locked inside
With the formal rising
I was scared
I think I was possesed

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
Everytime your body's next to mine
Somethin' deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly

When we touch
Girl, you don't know
How it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real!

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

[Verse 4:]
She had an attitude
I can't explain
You never know if your in flame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on a countdown till I get hurt

Her blood was hot
She burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

[Chorus:]
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you

This bursting queen
Living her life like a bad sweet dream)

Telling me lies
When the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

I just wanna be close to you

Walkin' the tightrope on love's highwire

She said ""Wait a minute, Bret, there's something I must say...""

She said 'If you wanna talk that's fine with me
But if you want more you'd better let me be'

Cause you can look but you can't touch
Cause the best things in life ain't cheap
You can look but you can't touch
Cause baby I ain't for keeps

Well maybe I'm a bad boy
Ok, so I've been around the block
But I am good at one thing
And believe me it ain't talk

She says ""You must be kidding
I've heard this all before
Other girls might buy it
But I don't, that's for sure""

Now wait a minute baby
I don't want you to go
She said ""Don't get no closer
The answer still is no""

So I wined her, dined her, fancy talked
Acted cool and smooth
Got my hands around her shoulder
Two inches from the move

Well I guess I'm about as close as I could be
So I finally made my move, she just said to me

Cause you can look but you can't touch
Cause the best things in life ain't cheap
You can look but you can't touch
Cause baby I ain't for keeps

Let me show you something
Mmm, let me set the pace
Slid my hand up her leg
As she slapped me across my face

Can't blame a man for tryin'
Wantin' action ain't a crime
I didn't plan on spending money
Just to get a piece of mind

Solo

So I started really thinkin'
And I got myself a plan
I opened up a cold beer
And I handed her the can

She drank it down real fast until she nearly choked
Jumped up on my bed, tore off all her clothes and said

Cause you can look but you can't touch
Cause the best things in life ain't cheap
You can look but you can't touch
Cause baby I ain't for keeps

You can look (look), but don't touch, no!
You can look (look), but don't touch, no!
You can look (look), but don't touch, no!
You can look (look), but don't touch, no!

Quality I possess, some say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh

[Verse 1]
You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself ""I just don't need her now""
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

[Chorus]
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause, baby, I'm the one who's keeping score

[Verse 2]
You'll change your mind and call my name
As soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you shoulda have known
Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
Because I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

[Chorus]
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey

Someday hey, hey

[Bridge]
Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll never come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only?
But when your down in your time in need
And you're thinking 'bout how you might be coming back to hold me
Just think again because I won't need your love anymore

[Chorus]
Someday
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for

Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet
But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet

How can you be so far away lying by my side?

You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move outta yo seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on!

Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much

Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn

That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump

Remember when we said, “Girl, please don’t go”
And how I’d be loving you, forever?
Taught you ‘bout hangin’ tough
As long as you’ve got the right stuff
Didn’t we, girl?
Ooh ooh
Didn’t we, girl?

Every time we hear the curtain call
See the girls with the curls in their hair
The buttons and the pins and the loud fanfares

Remember when we traveled 'round the world
We met a lot of people and girls
Fan mail from everywhere
Showed us how you care

Used to be so easy
To give my heart away
But I found out the hard way
There's a price you have to pay

I found out that love
Was no friend of mine
I should have known
Time after time

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

Used to be so easy
To fall in love again
But I found out the hard way
It's a road that leads to pain
I found out that love
Was more than just a game
Playing to win
But you lose just the same

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

So many years since I've seen your face
But here in my heart there's an empty space
Where you used to be

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

Though the days come and go
There is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you

58,I can't stand it,Streetmoves (Album),Twenty 4 Seven,1989,249412,38,"

Wake up, wake up, better stand up
We know what time it is, we better stop
If you care for you life, pay attention
But even if you don't I wanna mention
Have fun and have a good time
Make the best of life and do it fine
But you gotta think
You know you gotta behave, cause...

Just take it easy when you go
Cause there's time enough for the show
Don't forget the feeling of romance
Even though your mind is in trance
Don't be mislead by vision
Cause it's more that just a decision
It is a rule and a new way of living
And it's the only chance that is given

Nothing's wrong is dreaming
About the way your life used to be
But let me tell you life is beaming
Just look around and you'll see
Get with it and stick with the program
Don't take the risk if you can
I believe it's more than just a wave, and ...

Can we try, try to make a new life
Let's start right now, don't jive

I'm gonna be number one in proving
That I think before I start moving
Let's get it right, don't hesitate
Don't wait to long cause it's late
And if you know there's danger baby
It is guarantee, no maybe
Bang! An explosion
Can you feel the vibe and it's strong
Bang! Bang! That's the notion
Taking care of life can't be wrong
Keep on loving, cause it's good
And standing tall is brave
I really hope that you understood, that...

Oh let it go through your body
Oh let it go through your soul
Oh if you wanna dance with somebody
Yhere's one thing you should know

Do you know
What you can do if you want to?
Do you know
Don't let your mind run free
Do you know
Better be safe than sorry
Do you know
That is the one for me

VERSE 1:
Can you tell me where we're going to
Can you tell me what it is we really want to find
Is the truth really there or is it right under our hair
For all we know it's been there all the time

CHORUS:
I say, nothin' comes from dreamers but dreams
I say, sittin' idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream
Nothin' comes from talkers but sound
We can talk all we want to
But the world still goes around and round
Round and round
We go round and round and round
And what we're lookin' for still isn't found

CHORUS:

VERSE 2:
Can you tell me when we gonna get to it
I'm tired of foolin' around I said I want to do it
I learned my lesson young I say, if you really want two have fun
Go for it and when you win, say ""I go for it""

[Verse 4: Michael Bivins]
I was at the park, shake, breakin and takin 'em all
And that night, I played the wall
Checkin' out the fellas, the highs and lows
Keepin' one eye open, still clockin' the hoes
There was one particular girl that stood out from the rest
Poison as can be, the high power chest
Michael Biv here and I'm runnin' the show
Bell, Biv DeVoe [Ronnie laughs]
..now you know!
Yo, Slick, blow..

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Bivins]
It's drivin' me out of my mind!
That's why it's HARD for me to find
Can't get it out of my head!
Miss her, kiss her, love her
(Wrong move you're dead!)

[Chorus: Michael Bivins]
That girl is (Poison)...
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is (Poison)..
(""POISON!!"")

Yo' fellas, that was my end of..
You know what I'm sayin', Mike?
Yeah, B.B.D. in full effect
Yo', wassup to Ralph T and Johnny G
And I can't forget about my boy, B. Brown
And the whole NE crew

70,Have You Seen Her,Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em,MC Hammer,1990-02-20,282800,45,"

Ah yeah, I'm glad I put this tape in
I'm just gon' cruise down the road
Look at the stars in the sky
And drift off into the sweet memories that I have
Of a love that my heart has been searching for
For so long, and I know somewhere
If I keep looking, that love I'll find
The picture grows clearer and clearer
From the back to the front of my mind
And like love, a love I know I'll have
The girl that I want, she'll be mine, she'll be fly, and it'll last

I see her face and I can't let go
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that love
She's a thought and a vision in my memory
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love
(Love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that the Hammer definitely needs
(Please be mine)
Baby be mine
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
So why don't you be mine
The search is going on
From coast to coast
A women for the man, who's propping the most
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is beating strong
This love cannot be wrong
I need her and I want her, so come on to my home
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm a keep looking
At the movies, in my car, on my stereo
At a game of Different World or the Cosby Show
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Yo Bill, tell me what's up
At the track, at the club, or out buying dub
If you've seen her, then I'll have her, cause I'm in love
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is hurting so bad
(Love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that I know I need
(Please be mine)
Be mine baby
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
Why don't you be mine
(Baby, be mine)
Where could she be?
At the store around the corner
Or wondering at night
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Hammer, you know I'm looking
Calling all my friends all around the place
Guy, Levert, or my homey Rob Base
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
If you've peeped her out, tell me
Yo, veo on the phone
Ted, Dre, or Ed Lover
Fab Five, homeys won't you help a young brother
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I got a picture in my mind
The thought is so clear of the love I need here
Like D-B magic, and why don't you appear
(Have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo' face
I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Oh, my sweet love
Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?
The girl is hard to see like an unseen VJ
(Have you seen her? Tell me have you seen her? Have you seen her?)

This is a song about those bad days
Start up happy and end up sad days
Talking about that Murphy's law chill
If it can go wrong, yes it will

Went to the store to cop some groceries
Friday night and I had the munchies
Filled the cart till it could not take it
One more bag of chips would break it

Went to the cheek out stood in line
Behind me a girl who was just too fine
Got in the ear while they rang the total
Reached for my wallet uh oh a bolo

Not my day I felt like a dummy
Went to the store and forgot the money

Oops up inside your head
Oops up inside your head
Say oops up

Me and amy under the covers
Scene is hot potential lovers
Demon in the sack is her reputation
In school then she is graduation

Touching holding heavy breathing
I knew I'd get it she is not about teasing
Left on the light so I could see reaction
Amy is a freak guaranteed satisfaction

She is soft as bubble bath
I am as hard as chinese math
Ready for the ultimate affection
Took out a pack obtain my protection

Rolled it on one hard stroke
It was my last and yes it broke

Oops up inside your head
Oops up inside your head
Say oops up

Yo, Vanilla. Kick it one time, boy!

Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy

I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell
In ecstasy in the back of me
Well that's my DJ D-Shay cuttin' all them Z's
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy

I'm lettin' my drug kick in
It controls my mouth and I begin
To just let it flow, let my concepts go
My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go!

Smooth cause that's the way I will be
And if you don't give a damn, then
Why you starin' at me
So get off cause I control the stage
There's no dissin' allowed
I'm in my own phase
The girlies say they love me and that is ok
And I can dance better than any Kid 'N Play

Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music, white boy I can't hear you, say it
Play that funky music say it, say it, say
Play that funky music, white boy it, come on
Yea, a little bit louder
Now come on, come on

Stage 2—Yea the one ya' wanna listen to
It's off my head so let the beat play through
So I can funk it up and make it sound good
1-2-3 Yo—Knock on some wood
For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious
Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
I'm an effect and that you can bet
I can take a fly girl and make her wet

I'm like Samson—Samson to Delilah
There's no denyin', You can try to hang
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style
Over and over, practice makes perfect
But not if you're a loafer

You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls
Soon—Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat
Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music white boy Let's do it

VIP. Vanilla Ice yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino
Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino
So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin'
Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin'
Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along
All through the ghetto groovin' this here song
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse

Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi
Startled by the bases hittin' ground
There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down
Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic
You trapped me once and I thought that
You might have it
So step down and lend me your ear
'89 is my time! Yo, '90 is my year
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, I
Play that funky music white boy can't hear you

You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it
Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it
So don't be mad and don't be sad
Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure
So come up close and don't be square
You wanna battle me—Anytime, anywhere

You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong
So come on, everybody and sing this song

Say—Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go
Play that funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go
Lay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear
Play that funky music white boy you say it, say it
Play that funky music A little louder now
Play that funky music, white boy Come on, Come on, Come on
Play that funky music

[Verse 1]
You had something to hide
Should have hidden it, shouldn't you?
Now you're not satisfied
With what you're being put through

[Chorus]
It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth

[Verse 2]
Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied

[Chorus]
It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth

[Post-Chorus]
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before

[Verse 3]
Now you're standing there tongue-tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell

[Chorus]
You'll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth

[Post-Chorus]
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before

[Outro]
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore

The time before
Never again is what you swore

Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping, it's hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She's sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey-coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one for me)
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

[Verse 2]
Silky, milky, her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent, so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay (On your loving)
Come around my way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one for me, to the bridge)
I need an around the way girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

[Verse 3]
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With your New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way, you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your bikin' shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee (On your loving)
I love you, you're from around the way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only— You got me sh—)
I need an around the way girl (An around the way girl)
Fine as can be (On your loving), she's all I ask
I need an around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me
I need an around the way girl (An around the way—)
Fine as can be (Way)

[Outro]
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out—

Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms

Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it

I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost, and blinded fool, fool

The hint of the century
Consider this the slip

Yo, I don't think we should talk about this
(Come on, why not?)
People might misunderstand what we're tryin' to say, you know?
(No, but that's a part of life)
Come on

[Chorus 1]
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

[Verse 1]
Let's talk about sex for now
To the people at home or in the crowd
It keeps coming up anyhow
Don't be coy, avoid, or make void the topic
Cause that ain't gonna stop it
Now we talk about sex on the radio and video shows
Many will know, anything goes
Let's tell it like it is, and how it could be
How it was, and of course, how it should be
Those who think it's dirty have a choice
Pick up the needle, press pause, or turn the radio off
Will that stop us, Pep? I doubt it
All right then, come on, Spin

Let's talk about sex, baby

And the bad things that may be

[Verse 2]
Hot to trot, make any man's eyes pop
She use what she got to get whatever she don't got
Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'
Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates, heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag so she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope

[Bridge 1]
Oh, hey, ooh, ooh, ooh, take it easy now
Uh, alright

[Chorus 2]
Let's talk about sex, baby (Sing it)
Let's talk about you and me (Sing it, sing it)

And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex (Come on)
Let's talk about sex (Do it)
Let's talk about sex (Uh-huh)
Let's talk about sex

[Bridge 2]
Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies, let's talk about sex, all right
Come on, all the ladies, let's talk about sex, all right
Yo, Pep, I don't think they're gonna play this on the radio
(And why not? Everybody has sex)
I mean, everybody should be makin' love
(Come on, how many guys you know make love?)

Let's talk about sex, baby

[Verse 3]
What we have here is subject to controversy
A three-letter word some regard as a curse, see
He may fiend and have a wet dream
Because he seen a teen in tight jeans
What makes him react like that is biological
But scheme of gettin' in those jeans, is diabolical
But of course he does it, and she gives him rap
And before you even know it, they jump in the sack
As a matter of fact, sometimes it’s like that
But anyway, ready or not, here he cums
And like a dumb son-of-a-gun, oops, he forgot the condoms
“Oh well,” you say, “what the hell, it’s chill
I won’t get got, I’m on the pill""
Until the sores start to puff and spore
He gave it to you, and now it’s yours

Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex

And the bad things that may be

[Verse 1]
Well, I started out down a dirty road
Started out all alone
And the sun went down as I crossed the hill
And the town lit up, the world got still

[Chorus]
I'm learning to fly but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing

[Verse 2]
Well, the good old days may not return
And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn

[Chorus]
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings (Learning to fly)
Coming down (Learning to fly)
Is the hardest thing (Learning to fly)

[Verse 3]
Well, some say life will beat you down
Break your heart, steal your crown
So I've started out for God knows where
I guess I'll know when I get there

[Chorus]
I'm learning to fly around the clouds
But what goes up (Learning to fly)
Must come down

[Outro]
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly)
Around the clouds
But what goes up (Learning to fly)
Must come down
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly)
I'm learning to fly (Learning to fly, learning to fly)

Life´s ambition occupy my time
Priorities confuse the mind
Happiness one step behind
This inner peace I've yet to find

[Pre-Chorus]
Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I´m not blind why can't I see
That a circle can´t fit where a square should be?

There´s a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can´t be filled with the things I do
Hole hearted
Hole hearted

This heart of stone is where I hide
These feet of clay keep warm inside
Day by day less satisfied
Not fade away before I die

If I´m not blind why can´t I see
Ooh, that a circle can´t fit where a square should be?

That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can´t be filled with the things I do

Should have known from the start
I´d fall short with the things I do
Hole hearted,  hole hearted
Hole hearted,  hole hearted

[Verse 1]
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all the cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hills
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, get back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

I am the one and only, oh yeah

Call me, call me by my name or call me by number
You put me through it
I'll still be doing it the way I do it
And yet, you try to make me forget
Who I really am, don't tell me I know best
I'm not the same as all the rest

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I've been a player in the crowd scene
A flicker on the big screen
My soul embraces one more in a million faces
High hopes and aspirations, and years above my station
Maybe but all this time I've tried to walk with dignity and pride

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I can't wear this uniform without some compromises
Because you'll find out that we come
In different shapes and sizes
No one can be myself like I can
For this job I'm the best man
And while this may be true
You are the one and only you

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

Across the street, the river runs
Down in the gutter, life is slipping away
Let me still exist, in another place
Running under cover of a helicopter blade
Flames are getting higher in effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere, someway
Where they're downing only deer, a hundred steel towns away

Is beating like a drum
With the words, ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing

Photographs and kerosene
Light up my darkness
Light it up! Light it up!
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley, I've got my eyes all over you, baby

Is beating like a drum

Shifting like the handle of a slot machine

No expression on my face

As long as you
Are by my side

Talk or just say nothing
I don't mind your looks never lie
I was always on the run
Finding out what I was looking for

And I was always insecure
Just until I found

Words often don't come easy
I never learned
To show you the inside of me
Oh no my baby

You were always patient
Dragging out what I try to hide

I was always on the run
Finding out what I was looking for
And I was always insecure
Until I found

You, you were always on my mind
You, you're the one I've been living for
You, you're my everlasting fire
You're my always shining star

A glass of wine, and the lights are low
You lying beside me, me full of love
And filled with hope....

No place for the brokenhearted
I can't stop this thing we started, no way
I'm goin' your way, yeah

You might stop the world spinning around
Might even walk on holy ground
I ain't Superman and I can't fly
But if you wanna stop me baby, don't even try
I'm going one way
Your way
Oh, it's such a strong way
Let's make it our way
Now baby...

You gotta know it's right

That's where I'm goin'

Oh, why take it slow

Hey, 'cause nothing can stop
This thing that we got, yeah

Yeah, you gotta know it's right

[Verse 1]
What's the time? Seems it's already morning
I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue
The TV's on, but the only thing showing is a picture of you

[Verse 2]
Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee
I try to read a bit, but the story is too thin
I thank the Lord above that you're not here to see me
In this shape I'm in

[Chorus]
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time

[Verse 3]
I try to call but I don't know what to tell you
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
Oh help me please, is there someone who can make me
Wake up from this dream?

[Chorus]
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you are missing me too
I'm spending my time (spending my time)
Watching the sun go down (I fall asleep)
I fall asleep to the sound
Of ""Tears of a Clown""
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time

[Bridge]
My friends keep telling me, ""Hey, life will go on""
Time will make sure I'll get over you, ooh
This silly game of love - you play, you win only to lose
Ohuhohuhoh

[Chorus]
I'm spending my time (spending my time, spending my time)
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time (spending my time, spending my time)
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound
Of ""Tears of a Clown""
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time

[Outro]
(Spending my time)
I can't live without your love
(Spending my time)
Uh, I'm spending my time, my time, my time
Bed's too big without you honey, honey

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee!

But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh!

They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality

I am tired of this devil

I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee-hee!

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

I see you comb your hair and gimme that grin
It's makin me spin now, spinning within
Before I melt like snow, I say hello
How do you do!

I love the way you undress now, baby begin
Do your caress, honey, my heart's in a mess
I love your blue eyed voice, like Tiny Tim shines through
How do you do!

Well, here we are, crackin' jokes in the corner of our mouths
And I feel like I'm laughin' in a dream
If I was young, I would wait outside your school
'Cause your face is like the cover of a magazine

How do you do the things that you do?
No-one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do!
Did it ever make sense to you to say bye, bye, bye?

I see you in that chair with perfect skin
Well, how have you been, baby, livin' in sin?
Hey, I gotta know did you say hello? How do you do?

Well, here we are, spending time in the louder part of town
And it feels like everything's surreal
When I get old I will wait outside your house
'Cause your hands have got the power meant to heal

How do you do the things that you do?
No-one I know could ever keep up with you
How do you do!
Did it ever make sense to you to say bye, bye, bye?

111,Disappear,X (Remastered),INXS,1990,249053,53,"

Say I'm crying
I'm looking at what's on T.V
Pain and suffering
And the struggle to be free

It can't ever be denied, and I
Never will ignore
But when I see you coming
I can take it all

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

Say you're mine
And give yourself to the
Feelings that you know
I'm needing
All that you can give me
All the things
That you do so well
Words are healing
Sweet anticipation
Making spells
As the shadows close in
Fall across all our yesterdays

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

[Chorus]
Disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear

Say if I could
Look into myself and reason
But I could never never see or
Make sense of the dealings

Turn around
Am I looking at salvation?
Make me realize all that I am, baby
You put the light inside this man

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

You're so fine
Lose my mind...

Birds fly, they don't think twice
They simply spread their wings
The sun shines, it don't ask why
Or what the whole thing means

The same applies to you and I
We never question that
So good, it's just understood
Ain't no conjecture
Just a matter of fact

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing

The only thing a river knows
Is runnin' to the sea
And every spring when a flower grows
It happens naturally

The same magic when you're in my arms
No logic can define
Don't know why, just feels so right
I only know it happens every time

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing

Oh when the cold wind blows
I know you're gonna be there to warm me
That's what keeps me goin'
And our sweet love will keep on growin'

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing

Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
It's what makes honey taste sweet
It's what makes your life complete

113,Cry for Help,Free,Rick Astley,1991,291800,3,"

She's taken my time
Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves
I'm not so sure

It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame

Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as she seems

Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all

The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste

Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?

All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help
All I can do is cry for help

No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain
Cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Why must we hide emotions?
Why can't we ever break down and cry?

All that I need is to cry for help
I will be there when you cry for help
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help
All I can do is cry for help

All that I need is to cry for help
I will be there when you cry for help
Is it so hard to cry for help?

(Cry for help is all I need)
No need to feel ashamed
(All I need is a cry for help)
Come on and release the pain
(Cry for help is all I need)
Put your trust in me
(All I need is a cry for help)
My love is gonna set you free

Born in Kansas
On an ordinary plain
Ran to New York
But ran away from fame
Only seventeen
When all your dreams came true
But all you wanted
Was someone to undress you

And all the stars you kissed
Could never ease the pain
Still the grace remains
And though the face has changed
You're still the same

And it's a long long way
From where you want to be
And it's a long long way
But you're too blind to see

Frame of silence
Of an innocence divine
Is a dangerous creation
When you fail the test of time

And all the photographs
Of ghosts of long ago
Still they hurt you so
Won't let you go
And you still don't know

And it's a long long way
From where you want to be
And it's a long long way
But you're too blind to see

When you look around yourself now
Do you recognize the girl
The one who broke a thousand hearts
Terrified the world

And all the stars you kissed
Could never ease the pain
And if the face has changed
The grace remains
And you're still the same

And it's a long long way
From where you want to be
And it's a long long way
But you're too blind to see

I'm hoping that you feel the same way

Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea

Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows

Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly like a silent tear
All this time the river flowed
Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?

[Bridge]
Teachers told the Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town
They lived and they died
They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found

[Outro]
All this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a Northern sun
If I had my way, take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations, they only get better one by one
One by one

123,Secret Love,High Civilization,Bee Gees,1991-03-25,222800,46,"

When do I cry
This breakin' heart
Just hurts me more
When we're apart
And there are two of us
With our secret love

Sleep pretty baby while you wait so long
Livin' with a love that's not just make believe
Lonely nights, I see your candle glow
And in my mind, I trace
Together we can take away
The time and the space

Baby when you got a secret love
Every little touch is not enough
Every little moment we're apart is pain to me
Maybe we can find some hideaway
Everybody knows but who can say
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy

Anyway you want me I'll be standing by
I don't wanna lose the one I hunger for
Naked eyes, they watch us everywhere
Nowhere to run, I cry
Everything to lose and no alibi

Baby when you got a secret love
Nothin' you can do but rise above
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy

When do I cry
This breakin' heart
Just hurts me more
When we're apart
And there are two of us
With our secret love (together we can take away the time and the space)

Baby when you got a secret love
Nothin' you can do but rise above
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy

In the hopes that there's a Heaven

You say that love will capture me
But not unless you give it free
We're sailing on the seven seas

The light of love that shines so bright
That the F.B.I. won't sleep tonight
Because I'm so in awe of you
That I don't know what to do
And I'm sailing on the seven seas so blue

Sick and tired, and I don't know why
Skin and bone won't touch the sky
Sex and lies can't bring me down
Because I've sold my soul all over town
And I'm so in awe of you
That I don't know what to do
And I'm sailing on the seven seas so blue

People try and drag us down
So we learn to swim before we drown
'Cause I'm so in awe of you
That I don't know what to do
And I'm sailing on the seven seas so blue
And I'm so in awe of you
That I don't know what to do

Eddie waited 'til he finished high school
He went to Hollywood, got a tattoo
He met a girl out there with a tattoo, too
The future was wide open
They moved into a place they both could afford
He found a night club he could work at the door
She had a guitar and she taught him some chords
The sky was the limit

Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue

The papers said Ed always played from the heart
He got an agent and a roadie named Bart
They made a record and it went in the charts
The sky was the limit
His leather jacket had chains that would jingle
They both met movie stars, partied and mingled
Their A&R man said, ""I don't hear a single""
The future was wide open (Oh)

Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue
Out in the great wide open
A rebel without a clue
Into the great wide open
Under them skies of blue

{PROLOGUE}

[NARRATOR]

Some folks dream of the wonders they'll do
Before their time on this planet is through
Some just don't have anything planned
They hide their hopes and their heads in the sand
Now I don't say who is wrong, who is right
But if by chance you are here for the night
Then all I need is an hour or two

To tell the tale of a dreamer like you

We all dream a lot -- some are lucky, some are not
But if you think it, want it, dream it, then it's real
You are what you feel

But all that I say can be told another way
In the story of a boy whose dreams came true
And he could be you

[Joseph]
I closed my eyes, drew back the curtain
To see for certain what I thought I knew
Far far away, someone was weeping
But the world was sleeping
Any dream will do

[JOSEPH]
I wore my coat
With golden lining
Bright colors shining, wonderful and new
And in the east
The dawn was breaking
And the world was waking
Any dream will do
[CHILDREN]
I wore my coat
Aah
 
And in the east
Aah
Aah
[Joseph]
A crash of drums, a flash of light
My golden coat flew out of sight
The colors faded into darkness
I was left alone

[JOSEPH]
May I return
To the beginning
The light is dimming
And the dream is too
The world and I
We are still waiting
Still hesitating
Any dream will do
[CHILDREN]
May I return
Aah
Aah
 
The world and I
Aah
Aah
[Joseph]
A crash of drums, a flash of light
My golden coat flew out of sight
The colors faded into darkness
I was left alone

[JOSEPH]
May I return
To the beginning
The light is dimming
And the dream is too
The world and I
We are still waiting
Still hesitating
Any dream will do

May I return

The world and I

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Bridge]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

[Verse 3]
I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
Show must go on
Show must go on

A woman on the radio talks about revolution
When it's already passed her by
Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about
You know it feels good to be alive

I was alive and I waited, waited
I was alive and I waited for this
Right here, right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history

Oh, I saw the decade in
When it seemed the world could change at the blink of an eye
And if anything, then there's your sign
Of the times

I was alive and I waited, waited
I was alive and I waited for this
Right here, right now

I was alive and I waited, waited
I was alive and I waited for this
Right here, right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history

Right here, right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history

Right here, right now
There is no other place I want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up

[Intro]
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

[Verse 1]
One two, tell me what you got
Let me slip my quarters inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up, rev me up my little buttercup
We can tug sheets snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not, here comes the brother with glow
A strugglin', bubblin' overweight lover hug pro
So what's it gonna be, me or the TV
Now let me take time to set your mind and your body free
So why don't you just stretch stretch for a sec
Lay down your problems so I can cop a quick wreck
Shake me, shake me baby Baby bake me
No need to fake here I am come on and take me
Wind your body baby move your body
I see you slip sliding come on and do it hottie
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling hunky–dory about this thing that I found

[Chorus]
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

[Verse 2]
I like the way you wiggle you don't jingle, but you jiggle
So spread open your love cause it's Heavy in the middle
Move it like a mover she wanted to groove so I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn so we played school and I schooled her
(Mary had a little lamb) But not like this
We can toss and turn, rumble, tumble and twist
Anything you want, I'll give it fantasies we'll live it
So lay down and relax, lover, my lady
Lady lover, my baby girl
Spread your wings so we can fly around the world
Harmony, charming me your fingertips are calming me
When you dropped the kisses, Suzie Q, you dropped the bomb on me
Stretch it, stretch it, flex it, flex it
Gimme the permission okey-dokey I'll bless it
Bless it like buddha, buddha has to bless
We can lay down after loving put your head on my chest

[Chorus]
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

[Verse 3]
What can we do what are we gonna do
Roses are red and violets are blue
Love is good and plenty if you get plenty good lovin'
Kiss you where you're hot give what I got to keep you bubblin'
Do me right, do me right my lonesome dove
Tell ya man one time what is this thing called love
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feelin' hunky–dory about this thing I found

[Chorus]
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

[Outro]
Here we go, keep it funky
Put your hands together, y'all come on
Bring it back one time
All up in money earning Mount Vernon
This one's dedicated to you
Know what I'm saying
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Manhattan
The whole New York City
I said I love ya to death
And ya don't stop
Ya don't quit, ya gotta keep on
Until the d-d-do it like this
Ya don't stop, ya don't quit
Ya gotta keep on and on and on

Yeah
Alright
Oh yeah

You burden me with your questions
You'd have me tell no lies
You're always asking what it's all about
But don't listen to my replies
You say to me I don't talk enough
But when I do I'm a fool
These times I've spent, I've realized
I'm going to shoot through
And leave you

Your purple prose just give you away
The things, you say

You burden me with your problems
By telling me more than mine

To think of us being one

You can ask us
Pushing down the relative
Bringing out your higher self
Think of the fine times, pushing
Down the better few, instead of
Bringing out the clues, to what the
World and everything anger to, brace
Yourself with the grace of ease
I know this world ain't what it seems

I'm crazy flowing over with ideas
A thousand ways to woo a lover so sincere?
Love and hate what a beautiful combination
Sending shivers up and down my spine

For every Casanova that appears
My sense of hesitation disappears
Love and hate what a beautiful combination
Sending shivers up and down my spine

And the lovers that you sent for me
Didn't come with any satisfaction guarantee
So I return them to the sender
And the note attached will read
How I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you

Oh you really still expect me to believe
Every single letter I receive
Sorry you what a shameful situation
Sending shivers up and down my spine

Oh I like to read murder mystery
I like to know the killer isn't me
Love and hate what a beautiful combination
Sending shivers make me quiver
Feel it sliver up and down my spine

And the lovers that you sent for me
Didn't come with any satisfaction guarantee
So I return them to the sender
And the note attached will read
How I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you

When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd trade the world
For the good thing he's found

If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he puts her down

When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on
To what he needs

He'd give up all his comforts
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It oughtta be, hey

When a man loves a woman, hey
I give you everything I've got
Trying to hold on to your precious love
Baby, baby please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down in his soul
She can bring him
Such misery

If she is playing him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes
Can never see

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause, baby, baby

When a man loves a woman, oh
When a man loves a woman, yeah
When a man loves a woman
When a man, when a man, when a man loves a woman

Ok, so your heart is broken
You're sitting around mopin', cryin', cryin'
You say you even think about dying
Well, before you do anything rash, baby, listen to this

Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

Fallin' in love is such an easy thing to do
But there's no guarantee that the one you love, is gonna love you
Oh, loving eyes they cannot see a certain person could never be
Love runs deeper than any ocean, it clouds your mind with emotion

Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

How can you help it, when the music starts to play
And your ability to reason, is swept away
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see, you're out of touch with reality
And now you cry, but when you do, next time around someone cries for you

Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime
Use your heart just like a tool, listen baby
They never tell you so in school, I wanna say it again
Everybody plays the fool

Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by the moon
Y' know I don't see you when she walks in the room

It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So I'm telling you, child

A man will beg (Love, we shine like a)
A man will crawl (Burning star)
On the sheer face of love (We're falling from)
Like a fly on a wall (The sky... tonight)
It's no secret at all

It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief;
All kill their inspiration and sing about the grief

A man will rise (Love, we shine like a)
A man will fall (Burning star)
From the sheer face of love (We're falling from)
Like a fly from a wall. (The sky... tonight)
It's no secret at all

Love, we shine like a burning star
We're falling from the sky tonight

A man will rise (Love, we shine like a)
A man will fall (Burning star)
From the sheer face of love (We're falling from)

Drums Please!

[Chorus]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 1]
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

[Chorus]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 2]
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kissed
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

[Chorus]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

There were times I wasn't kind
And there were times I wasn't even around

156,Set Adrift on Memory Bliss (Re-Recorded),Latest & Greatest,P.M. Dawn,2014-02-24,235800,52,"

Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

The camera pans to a cocktail glass
Behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring
Then you know I can't remember a damn thing

I think its one of those déjà vu things
Or a dream that's trying to tell me something
Or will I ever stop thinking about it
I don't know, I doubt it

Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find if I met you
Let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Misses Princess who?

Often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone, solitaire

I can remember when I caught up
With a past-time intimate friend, she said
""Bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me.""

She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring

An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning

Reality used to be a friend of mine
Caused complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
Guess whose piece of the cake is Jack gone

She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do
I feel for her, I really do

And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big P.M. Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me
Baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

You know just how to hurt me
And how to take all the pain away
Girl, you must be the devil in disguise
There were times, I think you knew
When I was so afraid of you
There's some kind of madness in your eyes

You know a place buried deep in my heart
Nobody else can see
Something in you has taken some kind of hold on me

Chorus
I don't know why I keep coming back to you, baby
I don't know why I keep coming back to you
To you baby

You say we shouldn't be lovers
And I say we can't just be friends
And all this talking just makes me want you more
You've got a way of confusing a heart
That nobody else could do
Why should I try, I don't want to get over you

Repeat Chorus

I'm so in love, so in love with the games that you play
So in love, and nothing can keep me away

You've got a way of confusing a heart
That nobody else could do
Why should I try, I don't want to get over you

I don't know why I keep coming back to you
Just tell me why I keep coming back to you

You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

Honey them hips is gone

Remind me of something James used to say...
""I like 'em fat""

[Verse 2]
I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack
Thursday never looking back
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Verse 3]
Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday, I'm in love

[Chorus]
Saturday, wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday, never hesitate

[Bridge]
Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love

[Verse 4]
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

168,Weather With You,Woodface,Crowded House,1991-01-01,224466,71,"

[Verse 1]
Walking 'round the room singin' Stormy Weather
At Fifty Seven Mount Pleasant Street
Well it's the same room
But everything's different
You can fight the sleep
But not the dream

[Verse 2]
Things ain't cookin' in my kitchen
Strange affliction wash over me
Julius Caesar
And the Roman Empire
Couldn't conquer the blue sky

[Verse 3]
Well, there's a small boat made of china
It's going nowhere on the mantlepiece
Well, do I lie like a lounge-room lizard
Or do I sing like a bird released?

[Chorus]
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather
The weather with you

[Instrumental Break]
1:55 - 2:14

[Chorus]
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather
Everywhere you go
You always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather
Take the weather
The weather with you

[Chorus]
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather with you
Everywhere you go
Always take the weather

Take the weather

169,Hazard,Rush Street,Richard Marx,1991-01-01,317306,61,"

[Verse 1]
My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right

Three years ago when I came in on Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
Saw the man inside

[Chorus 1]
We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town

[Verse 2]
No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking all alone
And never came home

Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

[Chorus 2]
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

[Bridge]
I think about my life gone by
How it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone

[Chorus 2]
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

170,Just Another Day,Jon Secada,Jon Secada,1992-01-01,327426,63,"

Mornings alone
When you come home I breathe a little faster
Every time we're together
It'd never be the same (It'd never be the same)
If you're not here
How can you stay away (How can you stay away so long)
Away so long

Why can't we stay together
Give me a reason, give me a reason

Cause I, I don't want to say it
I don't want to find another way
Make it through the day without you
I - I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you
It's just another day, oh

Making the time
(Find the right lines) to make you stay forever
What do I have to tell you
I'm just trying to hold on to something
(Trying to hold on to something good)
Oh, give us a chance to make it, (give us a chance to make it)
To make it
Oh, no no

Don't wanna hold on to never
I'm not that strong, I'm not that strong

I - I don't want to say it
I don't want to find another way
Make it through the day without you
I - I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you
No

Why can't you stay forever
Just give me a reason, give me a reason

Cause I, I don't want to say it
I don't want to find another way (Don't want to find a way)
Make it through the day without you
(I want to make it through the day, no)
I - I can't resist (baby, no)
Trying to find exactly what I miss
It's just another day without you
I - I don't want to say it (Don't want to find a way no)
I don't want to find another way
Make it through the day without you

Laughter in the rain

She says 'it's not you - it's me
I need a little time, a little space
A place to find myself again you know?'
Oh yes, I know a goodbye when I hear it
She smiles
But her heart's already out there
Walking down the street

She says
'I don't want nobody else, I love you'
She's lying
'there won't be somebody else, and that's true'
She's lying
'say you'll always be my friend, sweet darling'
Why does she pretend?

Ain't no doubt, it's plain to see
A woman like you is no good for me
Your heart's beating at another door
I'm a damned fool for to ask for more

She says
It's like in a song, remember?
If you love someone, set them free
Well, that's how it is for me
But you know I'll always come back
And then she kisses me
And somewhere I hear a door slam
So I say 'fine'
And just hope that I'm a better liar
Than she is

She says
'I don't want nobody else
I love you'
She's lying
'say you'll always be my friend
Sweet darling'
Why does she pretend?

Ain't no doubt, it's plain to see

Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass

You were the sweetest thing
That I ever knew
But I don't care for sugar, honey
If I can't have you
Since you've abandoned me
My whole life has crashed
Won't you pick the pieces up
'Cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass

[Chorus]
Walking on, walking on broken glass (Woohoo, yeah)
Walking on, walking on broken glass

[Verse 2]
The sun's still shining in the big blue sky
But it don't mean nothing to me
Ohoh, let the rain come down
Let the wind blow through me
I'm living in an empty room
With all the windows smashed
And I've got so little left to lose
That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass

[Chorus]
Walking on, walking on broken glass (Woohoo)

[Bridge]
And if you're trying to cut me down
You know that I might bleed
'Cause if you're trying to cut me down
I know that you'll succeed
And if you want to hurt me
There's nothing left to fear
'Cause if you want to hurt me
You're doing really well my dear

[Verse 3]
Now every one of us was made to suffer
Every one of us was made to weep
But we've been hurting one another
And now the pain has cut too deep
So take me from the wreckage
Save me from the blast
Lift me up and take me back
Don't let me keep on walking (don't let me keep on walking)
I can't keep on walking (keep on walking on)
Keep on walking on broken glass

Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?

Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all the cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hills
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, get back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test if you let me try (Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test if you let me try (Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)

[Verse 1]
Sitting in my class
Just drifting away
Staring into the windows of the world
Yeah
I can't hear the teacher
His books don't call me at all
I don't see the bad boys trying to catch some play

[Chorus]
'Cause I love your smile
I love your smile

[Verse 2]
The clock at work says three
And I wanna be free
Free to scream, free to bathe
Free to paint my toes all day, woo!
My boss is lame you know
And so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway

[Chorus]
'Cause I love your smile
Hey, said I love your smile

[Bridge]
Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl
With the love you give
You rock my world
You dig?

[Rap]
I'm showin' the life that I'm living
This is the life that I have and it's given to you
Yeah and it's true
La-dee-da
Twinkly dee
Do you, believe in a girl like me?
Shanice is the one for you to be with
But when I'm caught all alone
I start fessing
It's from a state of depression
And the thunder clouds of doubt move in
I begin to wonder
""Do you still love me?""
But after that
My whole world is beautiful

Blow, Branford, blow

Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

[Verse 1]
Don't look back, keep your head held high, don't ask them why
Because life is short, and before you know, you're feeling old
And your heart is breaking, don't hold on to the past
Well, that's too much to ask

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need of a friend
Why did it have to end? And why do they always say

[Verse 2]
No regrets, but I wish that you were here with me
Well, then there's hope yet, I can see your face In our secret place
You're not just a memory, say goodbye to yesterday
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground (Used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me
This used to be our playground (Used to be)
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me

[Verse 1]
I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one

[Verse 2]
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Ooh, baby, you're the one

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun

When stars collide like you and I

Took a drive in the dirty rain
To a place where the wind calls your name
Under the trees, the river laughing at you and me

186,Sleeping Satellite,Great Expectations,Tasmin Archer,1992-10-19,281853,60,"

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite

Did we fly to the moon too soon
Did we squander the chance
In the rush of the race
The reason we chase is lost in romance
And still we try
To justify the waste
For a taste of man's greatest adventure

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite

Have we lost what it takes to advance?
Have we peaked too soon?
If the world is so green
Then why does it scream under a blue moon
We wonder why
If the earth's sacrificed
For the price of it's greatest treasure

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite

And when we shoot for stars
What a giant step
Have we got what it takes
To carry the weight of this concept
Or pass it by like a shot in the dark
Miss the mark with a sense of adventure

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite

And see how I try
You feel me, so heal me
And tear me apart

And I won't tell a soul

About my goodnight girl

Caught up in your wishin' well
You hopes inside it
Take your love 'n' promises
And make them last (you make them last)

You keep me so near you
And see me so far
And hold me and send me
And deep in your heart

And make them last (you make them last)

It doesn't matter how sad
I made you
Doesn't matter how hard

Just remember the same
Old reason
Reflected in your eyes
You said you wanted me

Caught up in your wishin' well
Your hopes inside it
Take your love 'n' promises
And make them last (you make them last)

Caught up in your wishin' well
Your hopes inside it
Take your love 'n' promises

You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart

I saw you walk down the street
With some other girl
Always thought that I was the only one in your world
Baby can you tell me so
Out of sight out of mind ain't what love ought to be
And I hoped all the time that you'd be faithful to me
Faithful to me
All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
I just want to be sure
That forever and more
You would be my baby

Love is just like a flower baby it has to grow
And when you are away I'm even loving you more
I just have to let you know
One on one is the way and that's the way it should be
So if you're not gonna stay
Then don't be playing with me
You can set me free

All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
'Cause all this love is for you
And you know that I'm true
And I'll be your baby

All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
'Cause you knew from the start
That you were working my heart
Won't you be my baby

I remember our walk the other Saturday night
Sweet harmonies filled and floated through our minds
Never felt this way before
We were riding so high an love and understanding
So why go wasting your time when you have got such a find
That is everlasting

All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
I just want to be sure
That forever and more
You would be my baby

All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
'Cause all this love is for you and you know
That I'm true
And I'll be your baby
And I want you to love me baby

The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first

Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you was just burning me up inside

I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night

What in this world
Keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go I hear
The beating of our one heart
I think about you when the night is cold and dark
Uh-huh, yeah
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and yoooooou
Ohhhhhhh

Woke you from your sleep to make love to you

I was yours and you were mine forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies

Months roll past, the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won you give for free

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you

Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out

Your smile got me boasting, my pulse roller-coastering
Anyway the four winds that blow
They're gonna send me sailing home to you
Or I'll fly with the force of a rainbow
The dream of gold will be waiting in your eyes

The pain that she goes through contained in the hope for you
Your whole world has changed
The years spent before seem more cloudy than blue
In many ways your baby's controlling
When you haven't laid down for days
For the poor no time to be thinking
They're too busy finding ways

My feelings can't describe it

[Intro]
Nothing but love, baby
Mm-mm-mm
My, my, my, my, my girl (Look into my eyes)
Would I lie to you, yeah? (Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah?

[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to know the truth
In my arms is the only proof
I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door
Now it's open, I can't do no more

[PreChorus]
I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?

Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)

Everybody's got their history (History)
On every page a mystery (It's a mystery, yeah)
You can read my diary, you're in every line
Jealous minds, never satisfied

I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (In this heart of mine)

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?

Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)

[Bridge]
(Would I lie to you?) When you wanna see me night and day
(Would I lie?) If I tell you that I'm here to stay
(Would I lie to you?) Do you think I give my love away?
(Would I lie?) That's not the kind of game I play

[PreChorus]
I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (In this heart of mine, deep in my heart)
Whoo

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)
(Would I lie to you, baby?)

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?

I've been where you are before
No one understands you more
You fear every step you take
So sure that your heart will break
It's not how the story ends
You'll be back on your feet again

Baby, this time
There ain't nothing gonna take this heart away
No more goodbyes
There ain't nothing gonna take my heart away

The pain's still alive in you
For what one man puts you through
You say that we're all the same
But I'm called by no other name
We all need a place to run
Won't you let me be the one

Baby, this time
There ain't nothing gonna take this heart away
No more goodbyes
There ain't nothing gonna take my heart away

Don't keep a dream in you locked outside your door
Just believe in this love
And don't be afraid anymore
Come on, come on

I need you to please be strong
I've waited for you too long

Baby, this time
There ain't nothing gonna take this heart away
No more long nights
There ain't nothing gonna take my heart away

This time
There ain't nothing gonna take this heart away
No more goodbyes
There ain't nothing gonna take my heart away
There ain't nothing gonna take my heart away

Back to the B-B-Brown
Now come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
Stop
The attitude you got has got to drop
It's no happs, so hold up
You told me that you jumped me from the get go
But when I'm gone, you get to gassin' and that's a no no
'Cause I catch you with the flip and goings like this tip
It's going down to what I'm about to get off the tizinip, yeah
Y'all can't deal with the flavor (True, true, true, true)
You know what it is

[Verse 1: Bobby Brown]
When you trust someonе
And you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trustin' about you
And you claim that you
Don't care whеre I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you
Say you trust someone
Why you calling all around?
Think I've got some dip on the side
Girl, you don't trust no one
And you're constantly in doubt
You lose the game if you play that way

Come on
Come on, come on
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Come on, dance
Come on

[Verse 2: Bobby Brown]
When you love someone
And you wanna love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
When you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you
Say that you love someone
Why you calling all my friends?
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl, you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game if you, if you play that way

[Chorus: Background Singers & Bobby Brown]
Get up off my back
Save your heart attack (Come on)

My name is Brown, that's what I'm called, so
Don't try to step to be wrong or you'll fall slow

Maybe baby take control of ya
Just like I told ya, I wanna roll
On a tip that's movin'
I'm gonna make ya move and groove and
Leave ya like ""Ooh"" when I touch ya
Give you so much of
The feeling of the deck that I'm dealin'
When I rub ya up and down
Yo, Stylz, kick it

[Verse 4: Stylz]
Well, I know it's been a while since you heard a change in a style
So what I'm gonna do is kick it something fly and new
A change, different from the typical
A bit more than regular, I'm not the others, original
'Cause originality and creativity
Added up together equals the BBB Posse
Yeah, we in the house, yo, kick it

[Intro]
Why?
Why?

[Verse 1]
How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done?
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
""Hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun""
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut?
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth

[Chorus]
Tell me
Why?
Why?

[Verse 2]
I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off
Besides, why can't you see this boat is sinking?
This boat is sinking (this boat is sinking)
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out
Turning inside out

[Chorus]
Tell me
Why?
Tell me
Why?

[Outro]
(Why?) This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
(Why?) This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tears, the tears we shed
This is the fear, this is the dread
These are the contents of my head
(Why?) And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
‘Cause I don't think you how I feel
I don't think you know what I fear
(Why?) I don't think you know what I fear
You don't know what I fear

Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past

When this fire is an ember
Later on

You get brave
When I get shy
Just another reason why
I think you could be so good for me
So good

[Verse 2:]
You like to drive
Like Mario Andretti
I like it
Taking my time

But let me say
Wherever you are going
You know it suits me just fine

[Repeat Pre-Chorus:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

Could be so good for me
You could be so good
Could be so good
Could be so good for me

You get brave
When I get shy
I know the reason why
You could be so good for
Good for me, baby
Good for me, baby

When I want to sing the blues
Good for me, baby
Oh
When I want to sing the blues
Good for me, baby

You could be so good
Good for me, baby
When I want to sing the blues
Good for me, baby

Here, have a dollar
In fact, no brotherman - here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you
Be strong, serve God only
Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused

Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal

Mr. Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr. Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize that all in all you stand tall

Mr. Wendal
Lord, Mr. Wendal

Give me one more chance, and you'll be satisfied
Give me two more chances, you won't be denied

My head is somewhere in between

The sun won't melt our wings tonight

CHORUS:
Everybody in the house of love
Everybody in the house of love
One love, one God
Everybody in the house of love

We've got to stop the pain, and put the wars on hold
Let the power of love, inside the soul unfold
Free the mind, let it rise above
We've got to change this world to a world of love
Mother Earth she's on overload
One more war and she might explode
We've got to look back and see a love from the past
We've got the time to change it but it's running out fast

BRIDGE:
Not bothered about your colour, concerned about your creed
In the house of love, everybody's free
Not bothered about your colour, concerned about your creed
In the house of love, everybody's free

CHORUS x2

How many more tears must she cry
How many more fears must be felt inside
Before we realise we're going too far
The Creator created, we tore it apart
But love can guide us back to the right road
We gotta save the planet, before she explodes
We've got to love our mother gotta let her know
Boom, boom, before she blows

Not bothered about religion, not bothered about belief
In the house of love, everybody's free
Not bothered about religion, not bothered about belief
In the house of love, everybody's free

CHORUS x2

Born to live, we live to die
Our eyes can't see they can only cry
But our mother's tired of crying, she's had enough
She's gonna surely blow, 'cause we're giving up
Build the house of love while we've got the time
Too many bombs in a world it's like a living mine
The house of love is what we must build
The past won't lost if the present is killed!

BRIDGE

CHORUS x4

Everybody in the house of love (x8)

Everybody in the house of love

[Verse 1]
Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone, I could trust someone
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again, darlin'
I said I'd never let nobody in

[Chorus]
But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you asked me to

[Verse 2]
Somehow ever since I've been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
Can't help feeling, darlin', since I've found you
That I've found my home, that I'm finally home
I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me, darlin'
I said I needed, needed to be free

[Chorus]
But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to

[Verse 1: Sting]
If the night turned cold and the stars looked down
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground
You wake the morning in a stranger's coat
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who's watched for me
My only friend, who could it be
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

[Verse 2: Sting]
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who's watched for me
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I had to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

[Bridge: Sting]
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I Hate to say It
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

[Verse 3: Sting]
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
And the jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I Hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

[Outro: Sting]
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
I hate to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

216,On Every Street,On Every Street,Dire Straits,1991-09-10,301893,55,"

[Verse]
There's gotta be a record of you someplace
You gotta be on somebody's books
The lowdown a picture of your face
Your injured looks
The sacred and profane
The pleasure and the pain
Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

A ladykiller regulation tattoo
Silver spurs on his heels
Says ""What can I tell you as I'm standing next to you""
She threw herself under my wheels
Oh it's a dangerous road
And a hazardous load
And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

A three-chord symphony crashes into space
The moon is hanging upside down
I don't know why it is I'm still on the case
It's a ravenous town
And you still refuse to be traced
Seems to me such a waste
And every victory has a taste that's bittersweet
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street
Yeah it's your face I'm looking for on every street

We'd throw at least one away
And walk the streets for half the year
Tryin' to find a new career

For thirty days you're on your back
Doing not a single dance

You can spend your life reading signs
Waiting for your interview
They can shoot the whole day for you
Now winter's gonna turn to spring
And you haven't accomplished a thing
So baby can't you make me just a little time
Cause you never know what's on my mind

It only takes a minute girl (only takes a minute girl)

They only talk to her, because she looks like a total prostitute, okay? I mean, her butt, it's just so big. Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross. Look! She's just so black!""

[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's wet, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *moan*
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!

Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

224,Let's Get Rocked,Adrenalize (Deluxe),Def Leppard,1992-03-31,295957,55,"

[Intro]
Do you wanna get rocked?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

[Verse 1]
I'm your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothing, in fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day but daddy don't agree
Because when I try to get away, he says, he got plans for me
""Get your butt right out of bed""
Stop bugging me
""Get up and move your sleepy head""
Don't shake my tree
He said, ""Mow the lawn"", who me?
""Walk the dog"", not my style, man
""Take out the trash"", no way
""Tidy your room"", come on, get real
Sorry Dad, got to disappear
Let's get the rock out of here

[Chorus 1]
Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

[Chorus 2]
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

[Verse 2]
I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Driving with my baby to get her in the mood
She's dialing through my radio and I'm ready to make my move
What she got ain't rock 'n' roll and it really blew my groove
It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me want to scream
Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins
Turn it off, that ain't my scene
Well, I'm sorry, girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question

[Chorus 1]
Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

[Chorus 2]
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

[Verse 3]
Hey, all I want to do is take a ride into the blue
Every time I want to love you, I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick and tired of dancing with this broom
I feel lucky today
Hey, look at that, man
Do you want to get rocked?
Do you want to get rocked?
Ho, it won't take you a minute
It won't take that long
So get on, get with it
Oh, come on everybody

[Chorus 2]
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Do you wanna, do you wanna?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top of it
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Love to rock your body baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way, get it night and day
Let's get out and play, rock the night away
Come on, let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked

[Outro]
Do you want to get rocked?

225,I Wonder Why,Curtis Stigers,Curtis Stigers,1991-09-22,267240,43,"

Love is a hunger
That burns in my soul
But you never notice the pain
Love is an anchor
That won't let me go
I reach out to hold you
But you push me away
You always convince to stay

And I wonder why
We hold on with tears in your eyes
And I wonder why
We have to break down to just make things right
And I wonder why
I can't seem to tell you goodbye
Yeah, I wonder why

I'm no angel
With my selfish pride
But I love you more everyday
Love is an anger
That builds up inside
As the tears of frustation
Roll down my face
Why does love always have to turn out this way

I don't want to fight again tonight
About the little things please baby
I just want to find my way
Back to love
And I'll need you there, baby

[Intro: Bobby Brown]
Come on, damn
Come on, kick it
Come on, damn
Come on, kick it
Now back to the B-B-Brown
Back to the B-B-Brown
Uh, ow
Come on, everybody, let's go
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

[Verse 1: Bobby Brown]
When you trust someone
And you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trustin' about you
And you claim that you
Don't care what where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby Brown]
Say you trust someone
Why are you calling all around
Think I've got some dip on the side
Girl, you don't trust no one
And you're constantly in doubt
You lose the game if you play that way

[Chorus: Background Singers & Bobby Brown]
Get up off my back (Get off)
Save your heart attack (Yeah, baby)
Ain't nobody humpin' around (Ain't nobody humpin' around)
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

[Post-Chorus: Bobby Brown]
Come on
Dance
Flip it back

[Verse 2: Bobby Brown]
When you love someone
And you wanna love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
And you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby Brown]
Say that you love someone
Why you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl, you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game if you, if you play that way, yeah

[Chorus: Background Singers & Bobby Brown]
Get up off my back
Save your heart attack (Uh)
Ain't nobody humpin' around (Ain't nobody humpin' around)
No matter what they say (No)
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around
Get up off my back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody humpin' around
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

[Bridge: Bobby Brown]
Girl, when you trust someone
You don't call on everybody
Ain't nobody foolin' around
And the more I think about it
You lose all your clout and
You lose the game, baby, if you play that way, yeah
Back to the B-B-Brown
(I think I wanna dance)
Back to the B-B-Brown
Back to the B-B-Brown

[Verse 3: Bobby Brown]
When you love someone
And you wanna love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
When you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby Brown]
Say that you love someone
Why you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl, you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game if you, if you play that way, yeah

[Chorus: Background Singers & Bobby Brown]
Get up off my back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody humpin' around
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around
Get up off my back
Save your heart attack
Ain't nobody humpin' around
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(STOP!)

[Verse 4: Bobby Brown]
My name is Brown, that's what I'm called, so
Don't try to step to be wrong or you'll fall slow
'Cause I just wanna kick soul to ya
Maybe, baby, take control of ya just like I told ya
I wanna roll
On the tip that's smooth and
Gonna make ya move and groove and
Leaves ya like ""ooh"" when I touch ya
Give ya so much of
The feeling of the deck that I'm dealin'
When I rub ya up and down
Yo Stylz, kick it

[Verse 5: Stylz]
Well, I know it's been a while
Since you heard a change in a style
So what I'm gonna do is kick in something fly and new
A change, this one from the typical
A bit more than regular, I'm not like the others, original
'Cause originality and creativity
Added up together equals the BBB Posse
Yeah, we in the house, yo, kick it

[Chorus: Background Singers & Bobby Brown]
Get up off my back (Come on)
Save your heart attack (Come on)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Throw your hands in the air, come on, come on)
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
(I can make you bounce)
Ain't nobody humpin' around

[Bridge: Bobby Brown]
Girl, you said you love me
And you said you trust me
Why you think I'm foolin' around?
I can't stand the pressure
You know I'm yours forever
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody humpin' around, baby

[Chorus: Background Singers & Bobby Brown]
Get up off my back (Uh)
Save your heart attack (Ow)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Come on, everybody, let's go)
No matter what they say
(Bounce, bounce)
No, it ain't that way
(Bounce, bounce)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Bounce, bounce, throw your hands in the air, come on)
Get up off my back (Come on)
Save your heart attack (Come on)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Throw your hands in the air, come on, come on)
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

[Produced by DJ Muggs]

[Verse 1: Everlast]
Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me, that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk, you better back up
Try and play the role and yo, the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up (C'mon!) c'mon, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling, jump up, touch the ceiling
Muggs lets the funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo, I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's ho
Feelin', funkin', amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
Than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

[Chorus]
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump!

[Verse 2: Everlast]
I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle, bring your shotgun (Shotgun)
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

[Chorus]
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump!

[Verse 3: Everlast]
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig 'cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Try to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
It up, up and around, then buck, buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie, I'll wet ya
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

[Chorus]
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump around! (Jump around!)
Jump up, jump up and get down!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! (Everybody jump)
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump!

I, I can't read the future
But I still wanna hold you close
Right now, I need that from you
So give me the morning
Sharing another day with you
Is all I want to know

And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes
Still shines, you shine like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go

And I, I didn't wanna tell you
Things I didn't wanna know myself
I was afraid to show
But you, you gave me a reason
A reason to face the truth, oh yes you did
To face the truth, face the truth
Face the truth

And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes
Still shines, you shine like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go
Won't let me go, let go of my heart

[Verse 1: Speech]
Lord, I've really been real stressed
Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin' up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)
But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

[Chorus]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Verse 2: Speech]
Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talking to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree, my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

[Chorus]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Interlude: Aerle Taree]
Eshe, she went down to Holly Springs
Rasadon and Baba, they went down to Peachtree
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes, a game of horseshoes

[Verse 3: Speech]
Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

[Chorus]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Outro: Aerle Taree]
Headliner, I won the game of horseshoes
Now you owe me a watermelon
Let's go climb trees and skip over rocks
Do like they do below the border
Speech's hair
Don't it look like the roots of the tree that the ancestors were hung from
But that's okay, get it cause he's down to Earth

In a word or two, it's you I wanna do
No not your body, your mind you fool
Come here baby, yeah

We're all alone in a villa on the Rivera
That's in France on the south side in case you care
Out of all your friends I wanna be the closest
That's why I tell you things so you'll be the mostest
When it comes to life, to be this man's wife
You got to be well educated on the subject of fights
I mean prevention of, in other words
It's R-E-A-L meaning of this thing called love
Are you up on this?
If so, then you can get up off hug and a kiss

Come here baby, yeah

We need to talk about things, tell me what cha do
Tell me whatcha eat, I might cook for you
See it really don't matter 'cause it's all about me and you
Ain't no one else around
I'm even with the blindfold, gagged and bound
I don't mind, see this ain't about sex
It's all about love being in charge of this life and the next
Why all the cosmic talk?

The sexy motherfucker's so fine I could drink her bathwater
A long, leggy 5 foot 8, packing an ass as tight as a grape
I want to spit some game but I said to myself
Just conversate, 'cause I'm usually quite the calm one
You never found me out prowling boy, I'm just havin' fun
I'm happy to change my state of mind for this behind
I bet that if you threw that ass into the air it would turn into sunshine

236,Real Love,What's The 411?,Mary J. Blige,1992-01-01,269973,62,"

[Produced by Mark Morales & Mark C. Rooney]

[Verse 1]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I’ve been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won’t you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I’m not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

[Bridge]
Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I’ll find
A real love

[Verse 3]
So I’ve tried my best and prayed to God he’ll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love

[Bridge]
See, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
(Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love

The homies got at me collab creations bump like acne
No doubt I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch
A dog couldn’t catch me, straight up

Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got them up open all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound

Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can’t get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

I like the way you work it

Here we go again

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm out to have a real good time
And now you wanna try to fade me
But friends of yours are friends of mine
So don't even try to play me
If you don't have nothing good to say
The words you will be withholding
These kinds of games a girl will play
Just like mother told me, so

[Chorus]
Here we go
Going through the same thing
(Here we go again)
Here we go
Don't wanna play the same game
(No, not again, I don't wanna go through it)

[Verse 2]
Now this ain't the time to make a scene
Because I'm out with my homies
I know you know just what I mean
So don't just walk up on me
There's a time and there's a place
Where we can talk about it
'Cause I don't want to be disgraced
With all your screams and shouting, but

[Chorus]
Here we go
(Here we go again)
Going through the same thing
(Here we go again)
Here we go
Don't wanna play the same game
(No, not again, I don't wanna go through it)

Climb the mountain
(What mountain?)
Swim the sea

See what I mean?

Going through the same thing

Here we go

Don't wanna play the same game

[Verse 3]
Now there's no need to explain
You know how I feel about you
So don't you take my words in vain
You know I can't live without you

I need some time to unwind
So try to be understanding
I hope that you would change your mind
Instead of being so demanding, 'cause

Here we go
(Here we go again)
Going through the same thing
(Here we go again)
Here we go

Don't wanna play the same game

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
""What's going on?""

243,I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That),Bat Out Of Hell II: Back Into Hell...,Meat Loaf,1993,721000,54,"

[Intro]
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Verse 1]
And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm crazy
Oh, it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Post-Chorus]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that

[Verse 2]
And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No no no, I won't do that

[Hook]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do

[Verse 3]
But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Call (and Response)]
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
(I can do that
Oh, I can do that)
Will you hold me sacred
Will you hold me tight
Will you colorize my life
I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?
(I can do that
Oh no now, I can do that)
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?
(Now, I can do that
Ooh now, I can do that)
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
(Now, I can do that
Oh now, I can do that)
After a while you'll forget everything
As a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
Then you'll see that it's time to move on
(I won't do that
I won't do that)
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later, you'll be screwing around
(I won't do that
No, I won't do that)

[Outro]
Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

244,Runaway Train,Grave Dancers Union,Soul Asylum,1992-01-01,265866,69,"

[Verse 1]
Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

[Pre-Chrous 1]
It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[Verse 2]
Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night
Earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[Outro]
Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
Runaway but it always seems the same

[Verse 1]
When she woke up late in the morning light
And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought
""Oh, what a morning""
It's not a day for work
It's a day for catching tan
Just lying on the beach and having fun
She's going to get you

All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby

So if you are in sight and the day is right
She's the hunter, you're the fox
The gentle voice that talks to you won't talk forever
It is a night for passion
But the morning means goodbye
Beware of what is flashing in her eyes
She's going to get you

[Chorus]
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy
All that she wants is another baby, yeah
All that she wants is another baby
She's gone tomorrow, boy

There was a time
When I was so broken hearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
Now listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

Now I'm trying to forget you
Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dying 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me

Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same

[Verse 2]
It's down on me
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist

Shalalala la la la
Uh huh

[Verse 1]
I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know she dances while his father plays guitar
She's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man, I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the morning
Shalalala la la la la, yeah..
Uh huh, yeah.. Cut up, Maria!
Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me, help me believe in anything
'Cause I wanna be someone who believes, yeah

[Chorus for Verse 1]
Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""
Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
Yeah, well, you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday
If I knew Picasso, I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

[Chorus for Verse 2]
Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you. I don't think so. She's looking at me.""
Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely

I'll never be lonely
Said I'm never gonna be lonely

[Verse 3]
I want to be a lion
Yeah, everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big, big stars, yeah
But we got different reasons for that
Believe in me, 'cause I don't believe in anything
And I, I want to be someone to believe
To believe, to believe, yeah!

[Chorus for Verse 3]
Mr. Jones and me, stumbling through the barrio
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""
I want to be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, ah son
That's just about as funky as you can be

[Chorus]
Mr. Jones and me, staring at the video
When I look at the television, I want to see me
Staring right back at me
We all want to be big stars
But we don't know why, and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I want to be just about as happy as I can be

Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars

So she took her love for to gaze awhile
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth

And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold

Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

[Verse 1]
And even though I know
The river is wide
I walk down every evening
And I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find
What I've been looking for

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

[Verse 2]
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't
Want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is
That I've been looking for

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

[Verse 3]
I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never
Been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire
I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

Came in from a rainy Thursday
On the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?

You've done me wrong
Your time is up
You took a sip (just a sip)
From the devil's cup
You broke my heart
There's no way back
Move right outta here baby
Go on pack your bags

Just who do you think you are
Stop acting like some kinda star
Just who do you think you are
Take it like a man baby if that's what you are

Cause I'm moving on up
You're moving on out
Moving on up
Nothing can stop me
I'm moving on up
You're moving on out
Time to break free
Nothing can stop me

They brag a man has walked in space
But you can't even find my place
Mm there ain't nothing (not a thing)
You can do
Cause I've had enough of me baby
Being part of you

Just who do you think you are
This time you've gone too far
Just who do you think you are
Take it like a man baby if that's what you are

Cause I'm moving on up
You're moving on out
Moving on up
Nothing can stop me
I'm moving on up
You're moving on out
Time to break free
Nothing can stop me

You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
You would say I lost my sense of direction
Yes, you could say all of this and worse but

If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do

There'd be nothing left for me to do

I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face

I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a - a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse but
Let me say this first

[Verse 1]
If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I might be rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

[Chorus]
But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just want to be with you

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger

There's a pale moon in the sky
The kind you make your wishes on
Oh, like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon
It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere and we both know why
But me, I'm getting stronger
We must stop pretending, I can't live this life

I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking, babe
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go

I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesn't bother me
Can't you see that I don't care
Or are you looking right through me?
It seems to me that lately (Seems to me that lately)
You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry
Could it be that maybe (Could it be that maybe)

Hanging on to the past
It only stands in our way
We had to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart

Too much talking, babe
Don't care now who's to blame

My therapist said not to see you no more
She said you're like a disease without any cure
She said I'm so obsessed that I'm becoming a bore, oh no
Ah, you think you're so pretty

Caught your hand inside a till
Slammed your fingers in the door
Fought with kitchen knives and skewers
Dressed me up in women's clothes
Messed around with gender roles
Line my eyes and call me pretty

Moved out of the house, so you moved next door
I locked you out, you cut a hole in the wall
I found you sleeping next to me, I thought I was alone
You're driving me crazy, when are you coming home

I stumble in the night
Never really knew what it would've been like
You're no longer there to break my fall
The heartache over you
I'd give it everything but I couldn't live through
I never saw the signs
You're the last to know when love is blind

All the tears and the turbulent years
When I would not wait for no one
Didn't stop, take a look at myself
See me losing you

[Chorus]
When the lonely heart breaks, it's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more than the fire that will roar
A hole in my soul
For you it's good-bye, for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls, for me

[Verse 2]
Seen you in a magazine
A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been
Hanging on the arm of someone else
I'm still in love with you
Won't you come back to your little boy blue
I've come to feel inside
This precious love was never mine

Now I know but a little too late
That I could not live without you
In the dark or the broad daylight
I promise I'll be there

[Chorus]
When the lonely heart breaks, it's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more than the fire that will roar
A hole in my soul
For you it's good-bye, for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls

[Verse 3]
Now I know there'll be times like this
When I couldn't reach out to no one
Am I never gonna find someone who knows me like you do
Are you leaving me a helpless child
When it took so long to save me fight the Devil and the deep blue sea
I'll follow you anywhere, I promise I'll be there

[Chorus] [x2]
When the lonely heart breaks, it's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more than the fire that will roar

Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

[Verse 2]
With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down

Now as you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend

Dreams can come true
Look at me, babe, I'm with you
You know you got to have hope
You know you got to be strong

Once there was this kid who
Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
But when he finally came back
His hair had turned from black into bright white
He said that it was from when
The cars had smashed so hard

[Chorus]
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

[Verse 2]
Once there was this girl who
Wouldn't go and change with the girls in the change room
But when they finally made her
They saw birthmarks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just been there

[Chorus]
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

But both girl and boy were glad
'Cause one kid had it worse than that

[Verse 3]
'Cause then there was this boy whose
Parents made him come directly home right after school
And when they went to their church
They shook and lurched all over the church floor
He couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just gone there

My child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew, he said
""I'm gonna be like you, Dad""
""You know, I'm gonna be like you""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play""
""Could you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today""
""I got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away
And he smiled and he said
""You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah""

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
""I'm proud of you, could you sit for a while?""
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys""
""See you later. Can I have them, please?""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""

I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time""
""You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu""
""But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad, it's been sure nice talkin' to you""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""

And maybe live within our possibilities

There's a place in your heart

Love's enough for us growing

And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace

This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into
Ploughshares

You are the candle, love's the flame
A fire that burns through wind and rain
Shine your light on this heart of mine
Till the end of time
You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

With all my soul I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain
This taste of heaven so deep so true
I've found in you
So many reasons in so many ways
My life has just begun
Need you forever, I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one

Call me raider, call me wrong
Call me insane, call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like
As long as you call me, time and again
Feel the presence of the aura
Of the man, none to compare
Loveless dying
For a chance just to touch a hand
Or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge, that makes them
Want to lose themselves to the debonair one
Hold me back, the simple fact is
That I'm all that, and I'm always near
One sexy can't perplex me
Now you know who's raw
As if you didn't know before
I know what I want, and I want it now

They hope, and pray, and die for men like me
Cause I'm the one, begotten son
That breaks the mold, get a look at male epitome
Style has never seen
That makes you want to grab, and hold, and squeeze real tight
Who's gonna be the one to save you from yourself
When you wanna take a bite
Please, oh baby, please
You beg, you want to stay, you got to get some
Caught up in the charm, that I laid on thick
And now there's nowhere to run
Just another fish to pick the worm on the hook of my line
Yeah, I keep many
Females longing for a chance to win my heart
With S.E.X. and plenty

One night in heaven. One night in heaven
One night in heaven. One night in heaven. (One Night)
One night in heaven. One night in heaven
One night in heaven. One night in heaven. (Yeaah)

Sometimes I get to thinking. While you are far away
Just how much I miss you and how time it ticks away
So sad when we are fighting, too much tension too much hate
Sometimes I need reminding, before it gets too late
Just one moment in my day. Take me up to a place
So far away in your heavenly space

Chorus-Heather Small:
One night (one night),hmm one night in heaven. When you touch me
You take me up high with the clouds in the sky
One night (one night),ooh one night in heaven. When you kiss me
You light up my life, make me feel so alive

While people create problems, lie cheat in vain
Come lay with me in my bed and wash away the pain
Take me on a journey let the pleasure start
Take me on a journey that leads straight to your heart
Just one look I can see in your face, yeah
You're my love satellite in orbit with you. Such a beautiful place

[Verse 1]
When the time grew near
For me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for
Hiding from a word I need to hear now
Don't think I'll hear it again (don't think I'll hear it again)

[Pre-Chorus]
But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (right by my side)
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (close my eyes)

[Chorus]
All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within

[Verse 2]
If you can't forgive the past
I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights so I regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

[Pre-Chorus]
But the nights were always warm with you (my love)
Holding you right by my side (right by my side)
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (close my eyes)

All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within

[Bridge]
Surely we must be in sight
Of the dream we long to live (we long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes
You'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone
Straight on back to me

[Chorus]
All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within

Come on
Time is running out
You and me
Harmony
You and me...
You and me..
Forever more

Please, baby, can't you see
My mind's a burnin' hell
I got razors a-rippin' and tearin' and strippin'
My heart apart as well
Tonight you told me
That you ache for something new
And some other woman is looking like somethin'
That might be good for you

[Chorus]
Go on, and hold her 'til the screaming is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you
Nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across the fire for you
I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

[Verse 2]
Please baby can't you see
I'm trying to explain
I've been here before and I'm locking the door
And I'm not going back again
Her eyes and arms and skin won't make
It go away
You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today

[Chorus]
Go on, and hold her 'til the screaming is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you
Nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across the fire for you
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

Go on, and hold her 'til the screaming is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you
Nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across the fire for you
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone

And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you

[Hook]:
Every hour of every day I'm learning more
The more I learn, the less I know about before
The less I know, the more I want to look around
Digging deep for clues on higher ground

Moon and stars sit way up high
Earth and trees beneath them lie
The wind blows fragrant lullaby
To cool the night for you and I

On the wing the birds fly free
Leviathan tames angry sea
The flower waits for honeybee
The sunrise wakes new life in me

[Hook]

The fishes swim while rivers run
Through fields to feast my eyes upon
Intoxicated drinking from
The loving cup of burning sun

In dreams I'll crave familiar taste
Of whispered rain on weary face
Of kisses sweet and warm embrace
Another time, another place

297,Come To My Window,Yes I Am,Melissa Etheridge,1993-01-01,236000,54,"

[Intro]
Come to my window
Crawl inside, wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon

[Verse 1]
I would dial the numbers just to listen to your breath
And I would stand inside my hell and hold the hand of death
You don't know how far I'd go to ease this precious ache
And you don't know how much I'd give or how much I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
Just to reach you
Just to reach you
Oh...to reach you
Oh...

[Chorus]
Come to my window
Crawl inside, wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon

[Verse 2]
Keeping my eyes open, I cannot afford to sleep
Giving away promises I know that I can't keep
Nothing fills the blackness that has seeped into my chest
I need you in my blood, I am forsaking all the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
Just to reach you
Just to reach you
Oh...to reach you
Oh...

[Chorus]
Come to my window
Crawl inside, wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon

[Bridge]
I don't care what they think
I don't care what they say
What do they know about this love
Anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Come, come to my window
I'll be home
I'll be home
I'll be home
I'm coming home

[Chorus]
Come to my window
Oh... crawl inside, wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon
I'll be home
I'll be home
I'm coming home
Come to my window
Oh... crawl inside, wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon
I'll be home
I'll be home

[Prelude]
Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt!
Über Sternen muss er wohnen

[Verse 1]
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

[Verse 2]
Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

[Verse 3]
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show it to me?
That you'll be there for me and care enough to bear me

[Verse 4: Michael Jackson & Cleveland Orchestra]
Hold me
Show me
Lay your head lowly
Told me
Softly then boldly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human
Lead me
Hold me
Love me and feed me
Yeah, yeah
Kiss me and free me
Yeah
I will feel blessed
I'm only human
Carry
Carry
Carry me boldly
Carry me
Lift me up slowly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human!
Save me
Lift me
Heal me and bathe me
Lift me up, lift me up
Softly you say to me
I will be there
I will be there
Lift me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly
Yeah
Show me you care
Hold me
Hoo!
Lay your head lowly
It gets lonely sometimes
I get lonely, yeah, yeah
Softly then boldly
Carry me there
Need me
Hoo!
Love me and feed me
Lift me up, hold me up
Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed

[Spoken]
In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart

299,"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)",Zooropa,U2,1993-07-05,298426,61,"

[Verse 1]
Green light, Seven Eleven
You stop in for a pack of cigarettes
You don't smoke, don't even want to
Hey now, check your change
Dressed up like a car crash
Your wheels are turnin' but you're upside down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You say when he hits you, you don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive
Oh no, is that what it is?

[Verse 2]
Red lights, grey morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim
It depends on who's around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip-synch to the talk shows

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing

[Chorus]
If I could stay, then the night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay, and the night would be enough

[Verse 3]
Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satellite television
You can go anywhere:
Miami, New Orleans
London, Belfast and Berlin

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And, if you listen, I can't call
And, if you jump, you just might fall
And, if you shout, I'll only hear you

[Chorus]
If I could stay, then the night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay with the demons you drowned
Stay with the spirit I found
Stay, and the night would be enough

[Verse 4]
Three o'clock in the morning
It's quiet, there's no one around
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel runs to ground
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel hits the ground

[Verse 1]
Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love, I'll remember forever

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me

All last summer in case you don't recall
I was yours and you were mine forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies

Months roll past, the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won you give for free

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard

But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh

A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

[Verse 3: Spinderella]
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Nah don' rush me good, and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac (shit)
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Ohh, uuuh
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
You know what I'm sayin', he's a mighty mighty good man
Y'all hear me, now check it out

[Verse 4: Salt]
My man gives real loving, that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that
I've got a good man

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
What a mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a mighty mighty good man
Tell me like that sugar
Now break it down
I break it down one time
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man

Right In The Night

That if you wanna fall in love, you fall in love
Right in the night
Right in the night
Right in the night, a sweet thing is what you get
When you fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love with music, fall in love with dance
Fall in love with anything that makes you want romance
Make a little soft on the way that you go
Just think that everything you touch can turn to gold
Fall in love with everything that you'd love to love
You know that laughter is a kind form to wake you up
So don't make me feel unpleasant like you do
You know that everything will fall right back on you
So fall in love with everything, fall in love with life
Forget about your troubles and be a little nice
You will not see me if you don't wanna look
Just come and get me in my big, big bed of love
Big, big bed of love
So fall in love with stories, fairy tales of truth
Innocence is part of what you lose with you youth
Show a little confidence, and show a little class
Don't kiss the past, the past ain't gonna last
Just fall in love with passion, fall in love with lust
Fall in love with all the things you're dreaming of
Fall in love with music
And you will get back

311,Round Here,August And Everything After,Counting Crows,1993-01-01,331400,61,"

[Verse 1]
Step out the front door like a ghost into a fog
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
In between the moon and you, the angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right

Well, I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying
Through the door, I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

[Chorus]
'Round here, we always stand up straight
'Round here, something radiates

[Verse 2]
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus

She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

[Chorus]
'Round here, we're carving out our names
'Round here, we all look the same
'Round here, we talk just like lions but we sacrifice like lambs
'Round here, she's slipping though my hands

[Bridge]
Sleeping children better run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

[Verse 3]
She says, ""It's only in my head""
She says, ""Shh, I know it's only in my head""

But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says, ""Man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?""
Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something

[Chorus]
'Round here, she's always on my mind
'Round here, hey man, got lots of time
Round here, we're never sent to bed early
Man, nobody makes us wait
'Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late

I, I can't see nothing, nothing 'round here
You catch me if I'm falling, you catch me if I'm falling
Will you catch me? 'Cause I'm falling down on you

[Outro]
I said I'm under the gun 'round here
Oh man, I said I'm under the gun 'round here
Well I can't see nothing, nothing 'round here

[Intro]
If the shoe fits
I want you to wear it and wear it good

[Verse 1]
Talking 'bout them times when I was by myself
I would always be looking for somebody else
But, as time went on, I had a talk with my mind
Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind

[Chorus]
And so, you call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

[Verse 2]
Friends and enemies around me every day
I can't believe half the things they say
Taking me for granted giving no credit at all
I'll just keep bouncing like a bouncing ball
Everybody seems to disappear on me
Can't trust no one as far, as I can see
If I could be that fly that's on the wall
Listening to my friends talk about it all

[Chorus]
You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you
Sons of Soul, y'all

[Guitar Solo]

I don't mean to step on nobody's foot, but ah -

[Verse 3]
When I need somebody there's nobody to call
When they need me, my phone rings off the wall
But these are my friends, and that's what they say
Constantly taking from me every day
You say...

[Chorus]
You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you
Sons of Soul, y'all

[Bridge]

[Chorus x2]
You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

Boom, keep in tune
Hollywood will zoom
Left to the point, right to the point
Smoke it, like it's a joint

Everything without shakin'
Yo, here with the bacon
Happy is how we should be
Realise that we are wealthy
Livin' here on this Earth
Enjoy what it's worth
Anger left behind you
Just don't let it find you
Love will not remain
As long as you complain

Pump the music and jam
There's no time for the problem
Not a thought to solve 'em
But just make sure you get it
Show the fella's you with it
Being proud you did it
Never will you forget it
There's a way to stop this
Listen to the prophets
Everything they said
Yo, it should be read
Paul, he had to tell
Things that made him well
L.I.G.H.T. shinin'
And my brother's heart cryin'

I come to your door
To see you again
But where you once stood
Was an old man instead
I asked where you'd be
He said ""she's moved on, you see
All I have is a number
You'd better ask her, not me""

And dialled your number
Not sure to put it down or speak
Then a voice I once knew answered
In a sweet voice
She said hello then paused
Before I began to speak

There were tears I could tell
But where were you now
Was you gonna tell me in time
Just give me a town
And I'll be straight down

About where I have been

As I walk down your road
Can't wait to be near you

[Verse 1]
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

[Verse 2]
You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me

[Bridge]
You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay and it's okay
You won't be laughing, girl, when I'm not around

Better, a peace of mind, no

I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna hear it

Colors your eyes with what's not there

324,Shape Of My Heart,Ten Summoner's Tales,Sting,1993-03-09,279226,71,"

[Verse 1]
He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect

[Verse 2]
He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance

[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

[Verse 3]
He may play the jack of diamonds
He may lay the queen of spades
He may conceal a king in his hand
While a memory of it fades

[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

[Bridge]
That's not the shape, shape of my heart

[​​Harmonica Solo]​​

[Verse 4]
And if I told you that I loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one

[Verse 5]
But those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost
Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost

[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

[Outro]
That's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape, the shape of my heart

Sittin' over here, starin' in your face
With lust in my eyes, sure don't give a damn
And ya don't know that I've been dreamin'
Of ya in my fantasy
Never once you looked at me
Don't even realize that I'm wantin' you to fulfill my needs?
Think what you want, let your mind free
Run free to a place no one dares to

[Pre-Chorus]
How many nights I've laid in bed
Excited over you?
I've closed my eyes and thought of us
A hundred different ways
I've gotten there so many times
I wonder how 'bout you
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

[Chorus]
If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl

[Verse 2]
Allow me some time to play with your mind
And you'll get there again and again
Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
Take your time cause we've got all night, ooh
You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs
And let me know what you like, if you like I'll go
Down, down, down, down, da, down, down
I'll hold you in my hand and maybe

Your smooth and shiny feels so good
Against my lips, sugar
I want you so bad
I can taste your love right now, baby
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl
If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl

[Bridge]
I've laid in bed excited over you
One hundred different ways
I've thought of many, many
All I want to say is

Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me
I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me

AAOW!

The way you had expected
We're having for the end
Party that was another story
For the party man, and his clan
So they will come again
Show and improve you, it's not the end
It's jam session
My profession
A truly hard yeah one an obsession
But the joke is over, you know what I mean
The party is gone and I'm out of the scene...

I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me
I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me

332,One Last Cry,Brian McKnight,Brian McKnight,1992-06-23,295357,62,"

[Verse 1]
My shattered dreams and broken heart
Are mending on the shelf
I saw you holding hands
Standing close to someone else
Now I sit all alone
Wishing all my feeling was gone
I gave my best to you

[Chorus]
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down to my last cry

[Verse 2]
I was here, you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you
I need some love to rain on me
Still I sit all alone
Wishing all my feeling was gone
Gotta get over you

[Chorus]
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind this time
Stop living a lie

[Bridge]
I know I gotta be strong
'Cause round me life goes on and on and on and on

[Break]
I'm gonna dry my eyes
Right after I end my one last cry

[Chorus]
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind for the very last time
Been living a lie
I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down
I guess I'm down
To my last cry

[Verse 1]
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

[Pre-Chorus]
But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

[Chorus]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du

[Verse 2]
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

[Chorus]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra

334,Always,Cross Road,Bon Jovi,1994-10-18,353026,73,"

[Verse 1]
This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

[Verse 2]
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'till the end of time

[Chorus]
Yeah, I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

[Bridge]
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

[Guitar Solo]

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

How could a person like me care for you?
(Ah) Why do I bother

Ooh, is enough enough?

Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes

No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong...
But where do you belong?

For so many years, I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon
Where I see a lot of stars
Ooh, is enough enough?

Hit it!
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA!

[Verse 1]
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William, but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if
He's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Verse 2]
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Bridge]
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
Cars
The sun and the moon but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party's just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Things can only get better
Can only get, can only get
They get on from here
You know, I know that
Things can only get better

I sometimes lose myself in me
I lose track of time
And I can't see the woods for the trees
You set them alight, burning the bridges as you go
I'm too weak to fight you
I got my personal health to deal with
And you say

Walk my path
Wear my shoes
Talk like me
I'll be an angel and

And you and you...
You... show me prejudice and greed
You show me how
I must learn to deal with this disease
I look at things now
In a different light than I did before
I found the cause
And I think that you could be my cure
So teach me to

Walk your path
Wear your shoes
Talk like that

From a phone booth in Vegas
Jessie calls at five a.m
To tell me how she's tired
Of all of them
She says
""Baby, I've been thinking
'Bout a trailer by the sea
We could go to Mexico
You, the cat and me
We'll drink tequila
And look for seashells
Now doesn't that sound sweet""
Oh Jessie, you always do this
Every time I get back on my feet

Jessie, paint your pictures
About how it's gonna be
By now I should know better
Your dreams are never free
But tell me all about our little trailer by the sea

You can always sell
Any dream to me
Oh Jessie
You can always sell
Any dream to me

She asked me how the cat's been
I say, ""Moses, he's just fine""
But he used to think about you
All the time
We finally took your pictures
Down off the wall
Jessie
How do you always seem to know just when to call?
She says, ""Get your stuff together
Bring Mose and drive real fast""
And I listened to her promise
""I swear to God, this time it's gonna last""

Jessie, paint your pictures
About how it's gonna be
By now I should know better
Your dreams are never free
But tell me all about our little
Trailer by the sea

Lay you down in the warm, white sand
And who knows, maybe this time
Things will turn out just the way you planned

About how it's gonna be

I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
I, I've been kissed by a rose on the grey

I, I've been kissed by a rose on the grey

[Verse 2]
There is so much a man can tell you
So much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah
Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?

[Pre-Chorus]
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large and
The light that you shine can't be seen?

[Chorus]
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey
Yes, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey

Now that your rose is in bloom

You say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time.  So?

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you

And you say I only hear what I want to:
I don't listen hard
I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
Or to anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative: no, no, no (bad)

And so I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singin' my song:
The lover's in love and the other's run away
The lover is crying cause the other won't stay

Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
Dying since the day they were born
Well.  Well, this is not that:
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure

You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take my anyhow, or anywhere with you

You said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, ""hey, I can leave, I can leave.""
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong, cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you

You said you caught me ‘cause you want me
And one day you’d let me go
You try to give away a keeper, but keep me cause you know you're just so scared to lose
And you say, ""Stay.""

And you say I only hear what I want to

346,Right Beside You,Whaler,Sophie B. Hawkins,1994-07-21,286666,47,"

I'm dancing in the shadows of life
And death is all around me tonight
I miss you making love to me right
Beside myself I'm holding you tight
Someone is waiting for me to rise
And dive into the ocean I cried
And I cried and I cried my baby to sleep
Beside myself my soul to keep

Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always

We're dancing in the shade of the summer sun
The drums are playing
The change to come was yesterday
In the heat beside myself I need to keep

Right beside you I feel
Right beside you I am
Right beside you I kneel
Right beside you I stand
Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always

Driving into town with the top down
Sun sinking low into the water I can feel your speed
One hand on the wheel one hand on my knee
I can tell you what I want you can do what you need
Darling nights are getting cooler in the city so close
There's a place we can do it somewhere right along the coast
We'll arrive on time just a little bit late
It's not a matter of style just a lesson in taste

I remember when I was your child
You made me up to be your lover
Now I'm standing right beside you
Other people still exsist
I don't pretend to love them less but darling
When you drive this way I lose my breath

Right beside you I feel
Right beside you I am
Right beside you I kneel
Right beside you I stand
Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Always

Right beside you I feel
Right beside you I am
Right beside you I kneel
Right beside you I stand
Right beside you I see
Right beside you I stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always

Don't need no drugs, to make me high!

Girl, come on over here
Let me hold you for a little while
And remember I'll always love you
Forever, everything changes but you

[Pre-Chorus]
We've said goodbye, the taxi cab is waiting
Now don't you cry, just one more kiss
Before I have to go
Hey, girl I know the situation changed
And so much is new but something in my life
Remains the same 'cause

Everything changes but you
We're a thousand miles apart
But you know I love you
Everything changes but you
You know everything single day
I'll be thinking about you

[Verse 2]
The rumors true, you know that there've been others
What can I do, I tell you baby they don't mean a thing
Now girl don't go and throw our love away
I'll be home soon back in your arms to hear you say that

Everything changes but you
We're a thousand miles apart

My love won't age at all

Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes, I give myself the creeps
Sometimes, my mind plays tricks on me

It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

Yeah
Oh
Been around the world
Been around the world
Seen the seas seven sailed across them all
Seen the moon rise over paris and I watched her gently fall
On to the beat
Keep moving never stopping
Though sometimes
I feel like dropping gotta keep on and be strong avoid the wrong
Cos in this life you walk alone
Through the danger zone until you get home
Been around the world but there's no place like home
Oh baby
Been around the world but there's no place like home
Oh baby
Take me home where my soul belongs
Been above the clouds that paint the sky
Stood below the cosmos and I pondered on a way
Back to the track in fact I'm breaking
Through I never knew that you would
Turn and walk away to stay
And leave me standing on my own
Far from meLike a nomad
Sad bad
Dreams about togetherness that we never had
Been around the world but ther's no place like home
Oh baby
(gotta keep on and be strong)
Been around the world but ther's no place like home
(until you get home)
Oh baby
Take me home where my soul belongs
Shout to the north to the south to the east to the west
To the home I love best where my soul can rest
Yes
Been around the world but there's no place like home
Oh baby
(to the home I love best)
Been around the world but there's no place like home

Your arms are warm but they make me feel
As if they're made of cold, cold steel
A simple kiss like a turnin' key
A little click and the lock's on me

Can't move my arms
Can't lift my hands
I won't admit to where I am
But I know baby

I'm in chains
I'm in chains

I pretend I can always leave
Free to go whenever I please
But then the sound of my desperate calls
Echo off these dungeon walls

I've crossed the line from mad to sane
A thousand times and back again
I love you baby

I'm in chains
I'm in chains
I'm in chains

Should have known passin' through the gate
That once inside I could not escape
I never thought this could happen to me
I never thought this is where I'd be

When you trust someonе
And you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trustin' about you
And you claim that you
Don't care whеre I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you
Say you trust someone
Why you calling all around?
Think I've got some dip on the side
Girl, you don't trust no one
And you're constantly in doubt
You lose the game if you play that way

When you love someone
And you wanna love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
When you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you
Say that you love someone
Why you calling all my friends?
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl, you don't love no one

You lose the game if you, if you play that way

So what I'm gonna do is kick it something fly and new

Added up together equals the BBB Posse

Ladies and gentlemen, as you know we have something special down here at Birdland this evening
A recording for Blue Note Records

What's that? Yeah...yeah...yeah
Funky, funky
How 'bout a big hand now
Wait, wait a minute

[Verse 1]
Groovy groovy jazzy funky pounce bounce dance as we
Dip in the melodic sea, the rhythm keeps flowin', and drips to MC
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks it pop
Ya dont stop 'til the sweet beat drops
I show and prove as I stick and move
Vivid poems recited on top of the groove
Smooth, my, floating like a butterfly
Notes set afloat, sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya
Dip trip, flip fantasia

(Yeah...yeah...yeah...What's that?)
Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)

[Verse 2]
Feel the beat drop, jazz and hip hop
Drippin' in your dome, makes you zone and bop
Funk and fusion, a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the rhythm you're cruisin'
Up down, round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless ya gots to get down
Fantasy freak thru the beat so unique
Ya move your feet, the sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhymes, some would call me a poet
Poems steady flowin', growin', showin' sights and sound
Caught in the groove in Fantasia I'm found
Many trip the tour upon the rhymes they soar
To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go off I take ya
Dip trip, flip fantasia

Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)

(Yeah...yeah...yeah...What's that?)
(Yeah...yeah...yeah...Funky, funky)

[Verse 3]
Jump to the jam, boogie woogie jam slam
Bust the dialect, I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic master
Rhyming on the mic, I'm bringing suckas their disaster
Beaucoup ducs but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, words manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia
Dip trip, flip fantasia
Out

[Outro]
Ya don't stop
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Rainy night, I'm all alone
Sittin here waiting for your voice on the phone
Fever turns
To cold, cold sweat thinkin about things we ain't done yet
Tell me now
I gotta know, do you feel the same?
Do you just light up at the mention of my name?

Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin new
That's just love sneakin up on you
And if your whole work is shakin, feel like I do
That's just love sneakin up on you

Hey heyyy yea

Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneakin up on your blind side
You might as well
Try to stop the rain
Stand in the track of a runaway train
Just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be yea
Come on let's finish what you started with me
Yeeaahhh

Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin new
That's just love sneakin up on you
And if your whole work is shakin, feel like I do
That's just love sneakin up on you

Heeey yea

Don't worry baby, it ain't nothin new
That's just love sneakin up on you
And if your whole work is shakin, feel like I do
That's just love sneakin up on you

Call me for the pleasure
You can call me for the pain
Call me on the phone
Or on the mental plane

I contain what you came for
Come without Karma
To destruct the dancefloor
Rise to the top, never stop
Drop like cream
You bring the body and
I'll bring the steam
You bring the body and
I'll bring the steam

Love can love you
Love can heal you
Love can see you
Love can feel you
Love can warm you (oh babe)
Love can calm you
Love will help you
Love won't harm you

There's no need to be afraid
Steam, steam
Let the lake of love flow
Steam, steam
Tonight let's become one soul

Steam, like a cream dream
Never stop rising
I'll rub you like a wave
Going out while the tides in
Precious bubbilicious
Hard or nice n' easy
Smooth with the move to sooth
Dry or greasy
Here is your harmony
Here is your friend
Kindred spirit of ethereal blend
Meet me on a cloud
Go on a journey, sure
I'll take your body on a mystery tour

The clock upon your wall
Is tickin' slower and slower
Time disappears as I go
Lower and lower
I know your final fantasy
But I can't repeat that
Doubting about me
Bet you doubt, I'll defeat that
I'm your spiritual dancer
Your emotion enhancer
Anyway you wanna go
Whether below or on top
I'll love you down
All around in and out and all about
I got your drinkable water
I'm your lover non-stop

Outside it's raining but inside is wet

[Verse 1]
It's twelve past midnight
Don't close your eyes
Your soul's half alive
And I'll be by your side

I've come to take you there
Show you how to care
Just be aware
That you'll have to share

[Hook]
I want your love
I want it tonight
I'm taking your heart
So don't you fight

I'll be your answer
I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
Your favorite dish

[Chorus]
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love

[Verse 2]
You saw a brand new high
Thought that you could fly
Did I hear you cry
Or did you like the ride?

You call my name again
No, it's not a sin
I'll show you how to win
And where I've been

[Hook]
I want your love
I want it tonight
I'm taking your heart
So don't you fight

I'll be your answer
I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
Your favorite dish

[Chorus]
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again (Don't you want it, don't you want it?)
I'm gonna be there till the end (Don't you want it, don't you want it?)
100% pure love (Don't you want it, don't you want it?)
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again (Don't you want it, don't you want it?)
I'm gonna be there till the end (Don't you want it, don't you want it?)
100% pure love (Don't you want it, don't you want it?)

[Bridge]
You'll never have to run away
You'll always have a friend to play
You'll never go out on your own
In me
You will find a home
Home

[Chorus]
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again (I'm gonna be there)
I'm gonna be there till the end (I'm gonna be there)
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
The back to the middle
And around again
The back to the middle
And around again
The back to the middle

Whenever I'm weary
From the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness
When my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still you seem to understand
Now and forever, I will be your man

Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune
That heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever, I will be your man

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
If I'd only known you were there all the time
All this time

Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever, I will be your man
Now and forever, I will be your man

You can try to move on so nothing will go wrong
Maybe he will be back to search for you, oh

[Verse 1]
In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

[Verse 2]
The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel, and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat, for the body, for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

[Verse 2]
So, so, so, so listen up, 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button
But, yo, I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on

[Verse 3]
'Cause what you see, you might not get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing, that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage

[Pre-Chorus]
Whhhhhyyyyyy
(Our backs are now against the wall)

[Chorus]
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage

[Verse 4]
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be – it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Want a love that is based on truth, not just dare

[Bridge]
You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine, in the light and the dark

[Chorus]
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it

[Verse 2]
You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go

You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start

[Verse 1]
She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights
Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on
Keep movin' on""

[Chorus]
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

[Verse 2]
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
Tired of myself, tired of this town

[Refrain]
Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
The nightfall will be comin' soon

[Refrain]
Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
You got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number and walked to the road

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

If you could give me one good reason
Why I should believe you
Believe in all the things that you tell
I would sure like to believe you
My heart wants to receive you
Just make me know that you are sincere
You know I'd love for you to lead me
And follow through completely
So won't you give me all I ask for?
And if you give your very best
To bring me happiness
I'll show you just how much I adore you

'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything
I swear the only thing that matters
Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
'cause you mean so much to me

Now it's gonna take some workin'
But I believe you're worth it
Long as your intentions are good (so good)
There is just one way to show it
And boy I hope you know it
That no one could love you like I could
Lord knows I want to trust you
And always how I'd love you
I'm not sure if love is enough
And I will not be forsaken
And I hope there's no mistakin'
So tell me that you'll always be true

'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything

Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Matters to me

There's a feeling in my heart that I know I can't escape
So please don't let me fall, don't let it be too late
There's a time when words are good then they just get in the way
So show me how you feel, baby I'm for real
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

'Cause you mean the world to me
You are my everything

Matters to me
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys

I wants to get fucked up when I'm chillin', whoa
The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill-in
You let her funk me cause my funk is the best
Comin from the West
Kickin that shit be occupied, dedicated to the preservation motion of hips
Hittin them dips, cd skips but I'm straight
As I bounce, rock, skate, now I'll toast to that
If it's rough, make the girls say
""Do that stuff! Aw, do that stuff!""
But ya got to be, you got to be a freak of the week
For the top gun, hit you with the bop gun

As the buffalo bitch go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip

And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale
Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes

I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
Unaware but underlined I figured out this story
It wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
And we'll be together, this time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I guess now it's time, that you came back for good

[Recording Info]

[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

[Chorus: LV]
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know

[Refrain: LV]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

[Chorus: LV]
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin'; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

[Chorus: LV]
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time, he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus: TLC]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem

Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease

Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah

Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby

It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know

Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found
Something going on

But take your time, think a lot
Think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

How can I try to explain?
When I do, it turns away again
And it's always been the same, same old story

From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away

I know I have to go

It's not time to make a change
Just sit down and take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through

Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

All the times that I've cried
Keeping all the things I know inside
And it's hard
But it's harder to ignore it

If they were right I'd agree
But it's them they know, not me
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away

I know I have to go

God, I feel like hell tonight
Tears of rage I cannot fight
I'd be the last to help you understand
Are you strong enough to be my man?
My man

Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
'Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man?

Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave, don't leave

Are you strong enough to be my man?

Look around your world pretty baby
Is it everything you hoped it'd be
The wrong guy, the wrong situation
The right time to roll to me
Roll to me

Look into your heart pretty baby
Is it aching with some nameless need
Is there something wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Right then, roll to me

And I don't think I have ever seen a soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there?

So don't try to deny it pretty baby
You've been down so long you can hardly see
When the engine's stalled and it won't stop raining
It's the right time to roll to me
Roll to me, Roll to me

So look around your world pretty baby
Is it everything you hoped it'd be
The wrong guy, the wrong situation
The right time to roll to me
The right time to roll to me
The right time to roll to me

425,Independent Love Song,Naked,Scarlet,1995-02-27,234826,44,"

You could say this was an independent love song
It's nothing like to us what love meant to them
But, that's not to say the love we have isn't big or that strong
I'm doing it a different way
I'm doing it a different way

You might say this is another boring love song
To be together and forever be true
And so today it's much the same as it was then
I'm doing it a different way
I'm doing it a different way

I'll show you how to take me
Go down go down
And I'll show you how to turn me
Right on right on
And I'll show you how to touch me
Right on right on right on
Right on right on right on

Now it's fine that many men will look my way
And I'll let them take me home and let them show me the way
And sure I'll like a few but I'll leave the rest to play
I'm doing it a different way
I'm doing it a different way

I'm gonna show you how to take me
Go down go down
And I'll show you how to turn me
Right on right on
And I'll show you how to touch me
Right on right on right on
Right on right on right on

In a different way, in a different way
In a different way, in a different way
In a different way, in a different way
In a different way

I'll show you how to take me
Go down go down
And I'll show you how to turn me
Right on right on
And I'll show you how to touch me
Right on right on right on
Right on right on right on

You could say this was an independent love song
It's nothing like to us what love meant to them
But that's not to say the love we have isn't good or that strong

426,Never Forget,Nobody Else (Expanded Edition),Take That,1995-05-08,311133,41,"

[Intro]
We've come so far
And we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young
And we hope for more

We've come a long way
But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this

[Verse 1]
Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just cause I looked so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

[Chorus]
Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

[Verse 2]
Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I understand the meaning of I can't explain this feeling now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make
And the fact of reality

[Chorus]
Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

[Bridge]
We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more
But remember this
We're not invincible
We're not invincible, no
We're only people
We're only people
(we're not invincible)
Hey we're not invincible
We're not invincible
So again I'll tell you

[Chorus]
Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

Never, everybody sing, oh baby
Never, no never, never forget for love
Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud

Never, everybody sing that song
Never, yeah, louder, louder, louder, louder loud
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream

[Outro]
We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And we're still so young and we hope for more

You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
Instead of slamming down the phone girl, for the hundredth time
I got your number on my wall, but I ain't gonna make that call
When divided we stand baby, united we fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Got the time got a chance gonna make it
Got my hands on your heart gonna take it
All I know I can't fight this flame
You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind
Cause I'm crazy 'bout you baby, time after time

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna fight no more, I don't know what we're fighting for
When we treat each other baby, like an act of war
I could tell a million lies and it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger, hits you right between the eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a time and a place and a reason
And I know I got a love to believe in
All I know got to win this time

Without you
One night alone
Is like a year without you baby
Do you have a heart of stone
Without you
Can't stop the hurt inside
When love and hate collide

You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind

How you control me
You bend and you fold me
Any way you please
It must be easy for you
The lovely things that you do
But just a pastime for you

Lazy so your summer days different

She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College

Caught her eye

She said ""fine""
And then in thirty seconds time she said

""I wanna live like common people
I wanna do whatever common people do
Wanna sleep with common people
I wanna sleep with common people like you.""
Well,​ what else could I do?
I said ""I'll... I'll see what I can do""

I don't know why but I had to start it somewhere
So it started there

I'd really love to be alone without
All the ache and pain and the April showers
But it ain't long before I long for you
Like a ray of hope coming through the blue moon

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When it all gets dark again
The whole thing falls apart I guess
It doesn't even matter 'bout the rain
Cause we'll get through it anyway
We'll get up and start again

[Chorus]
Cause we could be lifted, lifted, lifted
We could be lifted from the shadows, lifted
Oh, we could be lifted up today
Lifted all the way, you and I forever baby
Lifted, lifted, lifted, hey yeah yeah

It's undisturbable, the peace we found
In a bright new space up above the clouds
Where everything is understandable
You don't have to say anything too loud

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When all our luck runs out again
We're brought back down to solid ground
I wouldn't say I'm mad about the rain
But we'll get through it anyway
We'll get back to the start again

Cause we could be lifted, lifted, lifted
We could be lifted from the shadows, lifted
Oh, we could be lifted up today

[Verse 1: Madonna, Babyface]
Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
(No one around)
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Verse 2: Madonna, Babyface]
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(Role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

I'd never tell you one lie, I'd never let you down
I'd never leave, I'd be the one who'd always be around
Baby give me a chance

I'd pull the sun down from the sky to light your darkest night
I wouldn't let one drop of rain fall down into your life
Put your heart in my hands

Baby, believe me I could never do you wrong
And I would never paint your world blue
And if sometimes it seems I must have lost my mind
I might be crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you

Do anything you asked me to
I'd even sell my soul for you
I'd do it all for you
If you'd just believe in me

Just take a look in my eyes, you'll see a love that's blind
Just take a hold of my hand, I'll take you to paradise
Ain't a star that's too far

Your every wish will be a wish that I will make come true
And if you want the moon I swear I'll bring it down for you
Let me into your heart

Believe me baby, got your name carved on my soul
'Cause you're the only one that I'll give it too
Go let'em say that I'm a fool to act this way

I'd walk across the fire for you
I'd walk on the wild for you
If you'd just believe in me

You'll see the sky fall down before it ever gets that far

Walk blindly to the light and reach out for his hand
Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand
Open up your mind and then open up your heart
And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart

'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way

Violence is spread worldwide and there's families on-the street
And we sell drugs to children now oh why can't we just see
That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay

But I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way

Ooooh

I've been seeing Lisa now for a little over a year
She said she's never been so happy but Lisa lives in fear
That one day daddy's gonna find out she's in love
With a nigga from the streets
Oh how he would lose it then but she's still here with me
'Cause she believes that love will see it through
And one day he'll understand
And he'll see me as a person and not just a black man

'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
I believe I believe I believe I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
Love will find the way (x7)

I don't wanna see you ever sad
And everything that I've got you can have
When it's all too much
You need some human touch
To see that it's really not so bad

But still, you feel like you're on your own

Can you see through your tears
I will always be here
And you're not out there all alone

Hold on, till you feel a little stronger
Hold on to me
Hold on, everything's gonna be alright
Just hold on to me tonight

Anything that hurts you, hurts me too
I´m not gonna let your world turn blue
Will you take my hand
And feel how close I am
There ain't nothin' I won't do for you

Chorus
Hold on, till you feel a little stronger
Hold on to me
Hold on, everything's gonna be alright

Standin' in the pourin' rain

[Verse 1]
It doesn't matter what I say
So long as I sing with inflection
That makes you feel I'll convey
Some inner truth or vast reflection
But I've said nothing so far
And I can keep it up for as long as it takes
And it don't matter who you are
If I'm doing my job, it's your resolve that breaks

[Hook]
Because the Hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The Hook brings you back
On that you can rely

[Verse 2]
There is something amiss
I am being insincere
In fact I don't mean any of this
Still my confession draws you near
To confuse the issue I'll refer
To familiar heroes from long ago
No matter how much Peter loved her
What made the Pan refuse to grow

Was that the hook that brings you back
I ain't telling you no lie
The hook brings you back
On that you can rely

[Verse 3]
Suck it in, suck it in, suck it in
If you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn
Make a desperate move or else you'll win
And then begin to see what you're doing to me
This MTV is not for free
It's so PC it's killing me
So, desperately, I sing to thee of love
Sure, but also of rage and hate and pain and fear of self
And I can't keep these feelings on the shelf
I've tried -- well, no, in fact, I lied
Could be financial suicide but I've got too much pride inside
To hide or slide I'll do as I'll decide
And let it ride until I've died
And only then shall I abide this tide
Of catchy little tunes
Of hip three minute ditties
I wanna bust all your balloons
I wanna burn all of your cities to the ground
I've found I will not mess around
Unless I play, then hey, I will go on all day
Hear what I say, I have a prayer to pray
That's really all this was
And when I'm feeling stuck and need a buck
I don't rely on luck because

The hook brings you back
I ain't telling you no lie
The hook
On that you can rely

You dream of love that's everlasting
Well baby open up your eyes

If you want tenderness
I got tenderness
And I see through
To the heart of you
If you want a man
Who will understand
You don't have to look very far
I can love you
Girl, I can love you

[Chorus]
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and Earth
If you were my girl
I can give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything
That's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that
I can love you like that
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move heaven and Earth
If you were my girl
I can give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything
That's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that
I can love you like that

[Collision]
I can, I can love you
Always kiss and hug you
Baby be mine
My one and only girl
My heart
My world
You're everything to me
I can, I can love you
If you let me love you
My one girl

[Verse 1]
You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take

Don't ever stand aside
Don't ever be denied
You wanna be who you'd be
If you're coming with me
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I'm gonna take me away and hide
I'm thinking of things that I just can't abide

I know the roads down which your life will drive (Life will drive)
I'll find the key that lets you slip inside (Slip inside)
Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door (Behind the door)

But I've never seen you before

Here we go again, thru the backstreets of my mind
It seems my life was standing still
Who's sorry now, it's funny how I didn't know it
Here we go again, fighting things we never win
It seems our love was standing still I'm sorry now
It's funny how I don't feel the love
I just hear the words, Julia says
She doesn't know what it's all about
She doesn't seem to care at all
Open your eyes and see
Love hurts
I won't be fooled again, looking for the dreams I couldn't find
The dreams for me were left behind
I'm sorry now, It's funny how
I don't feel the love
I just hear the words, Julia says
She doesn't know what it's all about
She doesn't seem to care at all
Open your eyes and see, love hurts
Julia please, open your eyes and see
Julia wants to be on here own
Sharing her thoughts, she is all alone
Dreaming of the things she wants to be
Where Julia don't belong
Julia said
She doesn't know what it's all about
She doesn't know, C'Mon Julia
She doesn't know what it's all about

451,Run-Around,Four,Blues Traveler,1994-01-01,279800,65,"

Oh, once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek, so shall we find
And when you're feeling open, I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

And shake me and my confidence
'Bout a great many things
But I've been there, I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing, ""Hey babe, let's keep in touch
Hey baby, let's keep in touch""

But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Ha la la la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking
And I got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Oh sure, the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah, I will drink in and always be full

Oh, I like coffee and I like tea
Like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well, all right, okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Oh, you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

You and I
In this moment
Holding the night so close

Hanging on
Still unbroken
While outside the thunder rolls

Listen now
You can hear our heartbeat
Warm against life's bitter cold
These are the days
The sweetest days we'll know

There are times that scare me
Were rattle the house like a wind
Both of ours so unbending
We battle the fear within

All the while
Life is rushing by us
Hold it now and don't let go
These are the days
The sweetest days we'll know

So we'll whisper a dream here in the darkness
Watching the stars
Till they're gone
And then even the memories have all faded away
These days go on and on

Hold me now and don't let go
These are the days
Every day is the sweetest day we'll know

These are the days
The sweetest days we'll know

Contagious as you think I am
Just tilt my sun towards your domain

Lost as you swear I am
Don't throw away your basic needs
Ambiance and vanity

Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
And I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?

Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

I'm Gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It'll heal all things
It won't hurt anymore
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back

Tell me when
Will I?
Tell me when
Will I?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when

Kelly took a lifetime
Searching for the bottom line
I wasn't into searching
'Cause I was doing fine
I wasn't into fighting, chasing
Sweating, slaving, fretting, racing
Any waste of effort
Isn't part of my design
Billy was an inspiration
Positive and kind
Until he let confusion
Overcome his youthful mind
Common sense dictated
I could never be so blind
And then
Then I see you

Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Happenstance an episode unplanned
Alone in time
Coincidence, the second chance
Re-sounding like a rhyme
How paths may cross against the odds
To wreck the plans you made
Among the crowd a face that smiles
To melt your masquerade
If only I could see you
Says the stranger deep inside
And lets you know that when you were
So sure you really lied
If only I could see you
Says the voice within your brain
And quietly, insistently
It says it once again
And then, I really need to know

Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Tell me when
Tell me when

It wouldn't seem so lonely
If only I could see you
Baby, you can be free
If only I could see you
You'll never have to doubt me
If only I could see you
Baby, you could free me
If only I could see you
If only I could see you

Tell me when
Tell me when
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?

Then
I really need to know

If only if only if only I could see you
If only I could see you
If only if only if only I could see you

If only if only if only I could see you
Will I see you again?
Will I see you again?
If only if only if only I could see you
Will I see you again?

If only if only if only I could see you
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
Tell me when
Will I see you again?
If only if only if only I could see you
Tell me when
Will I see you again?

If only if only if only I could see you
If only if only if only I could see you

Now, now they can see the tears in our eyes

Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
I never knew that you'd get married
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago

[Outro]
Oh, what are you doing Sunday, baby?
Would you like to come and meet me maybe?
You can even bring your baby
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
What are you doing Sunday, baby?
Would you like to come and meet me maybe?
You can even bring your baby
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Intro]
I'll give you love
The things you want
Ohhh... Ahh...
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you...

[Verse 1]
Sitting at home another lonely night
Wish you were here so I can hold you tight
Pain in my heart because I'm all alone
Why did you leave
Why did your love have to gooo
And I would do anything for you
I would
Thinking of ways that I could win your heart
But I'm so confused, I don't know where to start
Visions of love forever in my mind
I wait for the day when I can say that love's mine
'Cause I would do anything for you
Yes, I would

[Chorus]
I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you

[Verse 2]
So what can I do to prove I need your love
What will it take because I won't give up
Open your heart and let your feelings show
'Cause deep down inside my heart just won't let you gooo
Girl, I would do anything for you
Yes, I would

[Chorus]
I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you

[Verse 3]
So if there ever comes a time
When it's true love you hope to find
Just call out my name
And girl, that's when I would do anything

I'll give you love
(I'll give you love oh, I'll give you love girl)
(I'll give you love oh, I'll give you love girl)
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you

I'll give you love
The things you want...

See now what I can find
Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel
Speedin down the lane even
Though the speed limit's twenty five
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie

Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey

And the clothes she wear
Some burn off them with tyre
And a draw down a gear
Some a shine up wax up
Not a sign of snare

Taking care of our career

Speedin down the lane even
Though the speed limit's twenty five
And when the sun goes down

Sweat a run off her body
With her caramel skin
I man smiled at her she
Looked at me and gave me a grin
I offered her a drink she said
Juice and Gin
And I whispered in her ear
I asked how you doin
Where was it that I reside
And I told her Brooklyn
Atmosphere filled with romance
Her eyes sparkling
Just her voice and what
She said let my poor head spin
Raggamuffin Shaggy
With a musical swing

(Background chatter)
This is how we do it!
(This is how we do it!)
Sha la la la la la lo
Shabada lo lo lo, whoa
(This is how we do it!)
Lo lo lo low-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, ""Monty, yo, we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

[Verse 2]
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say...

[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
Y?N-Vee, SCC (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)

[Verse 3]
Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6' 8"" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're makin' tha dash

[Chorus]
Ohh, I'm buzzin' because... (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)

[Outro]
Oh, it's party time! (This is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the West Side (This is how we do it)
OG's got the flavor, yeah (This is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
C'mon now, Def Jam, you know what it is (This is how we do it)

Yo Montell, this Percy, man

Man I'm sitting up here listening to ya tape, dude
And this shit is on, man

When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on

I was like deep in a cool
What'nt gon' be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly conversations
Had no time for new relation-ships

I must admit to you, when I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
But this time you have turned me on
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on and I am

Oh why do I feel the way I do? (Diggin', diggin', diggin' on you)
When all I can think about is you
What was it in a line, that made me fall for you?
Do you know, why I'm diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you?

Diggin' the scene

472,Who Will Save Your Soul,Pieces Of You,Jewel,1995-02-28,239293,53,"

[Verse 1]
People livin' their lives for you on TV
They say they're better than you and you agree
He says, ""Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls""
Says, ""Come here boys, there ain't nothing for free""
Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill, another cute cheap thrill
You know you love him if you put in your will, but

[Chorus]
Who will save your souls when it comes to the powers now?
Who, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?
La dee-dee-da, dee-da, dee-da-da, da-la-da

[Verse 2]
We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss 'em
And the cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day, another dollar, another war
Another tower went up where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many different Gods as there are flowers
But we call religion our friend
We're so worried about saving our souls
Afraid that God will take His toll that we forget to begin, but

[Chorus]
Who will save your soul when it comes to the babies now?
Who, who will save your soul after all those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
La dee-dee-da, dee-da, dee-da-da, da-la-da

[Verse 3]
Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking their kill
Got social security but it doesn't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
So you bargain with the Devil, but you're okay for today, say
That you love them, take their money and run
Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts

[Chorus]
Who will save-ave your soul when it comes to the babies?
Oh, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save-ave your souls if you won't save your own?

I was young (BOP)
And didn't have no where to run
I needed to wake up (Wake up) and see (And see)
What's in front of me (na-na-op)
There had to be a better way
Sing it again a better way
To show I'm grateful (hum)
So I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know much you mean to me

[Chorus: All]
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

[Verse 2: Wanya & Mike]
All through my life
I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing everywhere I go
Things you taught me they would show
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
I sho nuff couldn't have survived without you, you

To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me, oh

You're the key to my life...

Rain on the window covers the trace
Of all the tears that I've had to waste
And now I'm missing you so
And I won't let you go away
Stain on the desktop where coffee cups lay
And memories of you forever will stay
And the scent of your perfume
And the smile on your face will remain...

And I never gave up hope when things got me down
But I just bit on my lip and my face began to frown
Cos that was just my pride and I've nothing else to hide
And now the way is clear and all I want to say is

All of my life the doors have been closed now
And all of my dreams have been locked up inside
But you came along and captured my heart, girl
You're the key to my life
Yeah

Year after year, was blaming myself (blaming myself.)
For what I'd done, just thought of myself
I know that you'll understand (you'll understand...)
This was all my own fault, don't go away

And I never gave up hope when things got me down
But I just bit on my lip
And my face began to frown
Cos that was just my pride and I've nothing left to hide
And now the way is clear and all I want to say is...

CHORUS

Girl you know that I feel for you
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Stop the thunder and the pouring rain
You're the one that's going to stop the pain
Girl you know that I feel for you
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
Stop the thunder and the pouring rain
Listen to me can't you hear what I say...

I was in love with you
I gave my heart to you
I did my best to keep you satisfied
You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back your love to me at all

I gave the sun to you
You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine
I gave my world to you
You said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done to make you be so rough

[Chorus]
'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
And 'til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

Girl I was there for you
Someone you could talk to
How could you just keep breaking my heart?
What did I do to you
To make you be so cruel?
I don't understand why you've been so wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I tried to be your strength
You said I was too strong
I tried to compromise
So we could get along
I gave my love to you
Despite your evil ways
I guess it's clear to me, there's only one thing left to say

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

There's a time when you know what you feel inside your heart
It's telling you that something is strange
Ooh girl, you don't have to deny it
All you got to do is just try it
You'll find our love is stronger if you're willing to change

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you

I should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are ""know-it-alls"" and I played that fool for you

I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

[Verse 2]
Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving

[Chorus]
If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

Where would I be if you hadn't discovered? (Where would I be?)
Which I did, inside of me

From a portrait hung up high (Hangs so high)

And the laughter we left behind

I made the choice, I was wrong, you were right
Deep down inside, I apologize

[Verse 1]
Brother Pele's in the back, Sweet Zina's in the front
Cruisin' down the freeway in the hot, hot sun
Suddenly red-blue lights flash us from behind
Loud voice booming, ""Please step out onto the line""
Pele preaches words of comfort, Zina just hides her eyes
Policeman taps his shades, ""Is that a Chevy '69?""

[Chorus]
How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre

[Verse 2]
Destination unknown as we pull in for some gas
A freshly pasted poster reveals a smile from the past
Elephants and acrobats, lions, snakes, monkey
Pele speaks ""righteous,"" Sister Zina says ""funky""

[Chorus]
How bizarre
How bizarre, how bizarre
Ooh, baby (Ooh, baby)
It's making me crazy (It's making me crazy)
Every time I look around (Look around)
Every time I look around (Every time I look around)
Every time I look around
It's in my face

[Verse 3]
Ringmaster steps out and says ""The elephants left town""
People jump and jive and the clowns have stuck around
TV news and cameras, there's choppers in the sky
Marines, police, reporters ask where, for and why
Pele yells, ""We're outta here,"" Zina says, ""Right on""
Making moves and starting grooves before they knew we were gone
Jumped into the Chevy and headed for big lights
Wanna know the rest? Hey, buy the rights

How bizarre

496,It's All Coming Back to Me Now,Falling into You,Céline Dion,1996-02-28,456866,67,"

[Verse 1]
There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

[Chorus]
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 2]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby, baby

[Chorus]
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

[Verse 3]
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

[Chorus]
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 4]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

[Chorus]
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now

[Outro]
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when I touch you like that

If you do it like this
(It's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 1]
When you pray with every breath
You know that is free as the love you have
Where does it end?
It's too much for me to take
There's no peace
You close your eyes
I'm all out of truth, I'm out of alibis
Where does it end?
It's too much for me to take

We're gonna love one another 'til morning comes
Seek the sweet salvation for what we've done
Give up resisting one by one, one by one

I know that I could never love any other man
One of these days he'll understand, understand

[Verse 2]
And his face, his heaven scent
He makes me believe there must be something else
Where does it end?
It's too much for me to take
I can feel the need in you
There isn't a thing I won't let you do
Where does it end?
It's too much for me to take

We're gonna love one another 'til morning comes
Seek the sweet salvation for what we've done
Give up resisting one by one, one by one

We're gonna love one another 'til morning comes

I hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man
He said he's been down this road more than twice
He was high on intellectualism
I've never been there, but the brochure looks nice

Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low

Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

He's got a daughter, he calls Easter
She was born on a Tuesday night
I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone
Why I'm a stranger in my own life

Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low

I've been swimmin' in a sea of anarchy
I've been living on coffee and nicotine
I've been wondering if all the things I've seen
Were ever real, were ever really happening (Really happening)

Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a winding road

Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought just to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me

Leave me, leave me

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care about anything but you

[Verse 2]
Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

If I could reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth

That this love I have inside

You would think my love was really something good

I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs, I got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you

Wipe the spots up off the mirror
Don't leave my keys in the door

I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie and it just wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad 'cause

Besides, what would I say if I had you on the line?
Same old story, not much to say
Hearts are broken, every day

I brush my teeth, I put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up and I turn the sheets down
And take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pj's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll all be alright
I shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause...

Dreams last so long

I feel you touch my hand in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep you warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?

Cos were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they
All should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know you're the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall

And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really need to learn
Cos were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they
All should let us be

Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo

Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you French toast again

The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

Put those patent leather pants - in the circular file
Sometimes I think - I might be lookin' good
But there's only one thing that fits like it should

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

Yeah it's you - it could only be you
Nobody else will ever do
Ya baby it's you - that I stick to
Ya we stick like glue

Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

The only thing I want - Yeah

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

[Outro]
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger
I heard you say
At least not today

I didn't ask
They shouldn't have told me
At first I'd laugh, but now
It's sinking in fast
Whatever they've sold me

Well baby I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you

It gets hard
The memory's faded
Who gets what they say
It's likely they're just jealous and jaded

Well maybe I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you
Until I hear it from you

I can't let it get me off
Or break up my train of thought
As far as I know, nothing's wrong
Until I hear it from you

Still thinking about not living without it
Outside looking in
Til we're talking about it, not stepping around it
Maybe
I don't want to take advice from fools
I'll just figure everything is cool
Until I hear it from you (hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you (hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you (hear it from you)
Until I hear it from you
Until I hear it from you
Until I hear it from you (won't take advice from fools)
Ooh (I'll figure everything is cool)
Until I hear it from you (won't take advice from fools)

Love, it has so many beautiful faces
Sharing lives and sharing days
My love it had so many empty spaces
I'm sharing a memory now
I hope that's how it stays

Now I'm deep inside love and still breathing
She is holding my heart in her hand
I'm the closest I've been to believing
This could be love forever

All throughout my life
The reasons I've demanded
But how can I reason
With the reason I'm a man

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh yeah
Hmm

In a minute I'm needing to hold her
In an hour I'm cold, cold as stone
When she leaves it gets harder and harder
To face life alone

Now my dreams are filled
With times when we're together
Guess what I need from her
Is forever love

Ooh, Ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, mm-mm-mm
Oh, oh, yeah
Now I feel forever love

Ooh, ooh
Oh yeah
Well I feel...

Ooo heh hey
Oh
What we’re living in
Let me tell ya

It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell
What magic spells
We’ll be doing for us
And I’m giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can’t see
I can’t breathe
No more will we be

And nothing’s going to change the way we live
’Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Whoa
It’s a crazy world we’re living in
And I just can’t see that half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these

Futures
Made of
Virtual insanity, now always
Seem to
Be governed by this love we have for, useless
Twisting
Of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
For we all live underground

And I’m thinking what a mess we’re in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip
The sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother
Can choose the colour
Of her child
That’s not nature’s way

Well that’s what they said yesterday
There’s nothing left to do but pray
I think it’s time to find a new religion
Whoa, it’s so insane
To synthesize another strain
There’s something in these futures that we have to be told

Futures
Made of
Virtual insanity, now always
Seem to
Be governed by this love we have for useless
Twisting
Of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
For we all live underground, whoa

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh
There's nothing so bad
As a man-made man
Oh, yeah
I know yeah

I know I can't go on

Ooh
Of this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change
Yeah
Things
Will never be the same
And I can't go on
Where we're living in
Oh
Oh, virtual insanity

Oh, this world
Has got to change
'Cause I just
I just can't keep going on in this virtual
Virtual insanity
That we're living in
Where we're living in
And that virtual insanity is what it is
Yeah
Ooh

Futures
Made of
Virtual insanity, now always
Seem to
Be governed by this love we have for useless
Twisting
Of our new technology, oh now there is no sound
For we all live underground, oh

Futures
Made of
Now virtual insanity
Now we all, we seem to be governed
By a love for this useless twisting
Of our new technology
And now there is no sound
For we all live underground
Yes we do
Oh

Now this life that we live in
It's all going wrong
Out of the window
Do you know
That
There is nothing worse than
A man-made man
I feel there's nothing worse than
A foolish man
Hey

Virtual insanity is what we're living in
Yeah
It is alright?

Maybe she'd be here right now
But instead...

I pretended I'm glad you went away
These four walls closin' more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say
The things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly
But you're nowhere around

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm tremblin' inside
And nobody knows it but me
I lie awake it's a quarter past three
I'm screamin' at night as if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah my heart is callin' you
And nobody knows it but me

How blue can I get
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know
I'll be lovin' you still

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

Tomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever, ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart
And hope you come back to me
Said when the nights are lonely...

And I just keep thinkin' about

Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come
But still I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing and I'll swear it might be fun
It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
How you gonna ever find your place
Running in an artificial pace?
Are they gonna find us lying face down in the sand?
So what the hell now, we've already been forever damned
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far

Rapping on the windows, whistling down the chimney pot
Blowing off the dust in the room where I forgot

Stepping through the door like a troubadour, whiling just an hour away
Looking at the trees on the roadside, feeling it's a holiday

Roll a number, write another song like Jimmy heard the day he caught the train

Ooh lala, ooh lala

He sips another rum and coke and told a dirty joke
Walking like Groucho, sucking on a number 10
Rolling on the floor with the cigarette burns walked in
I'll miss the crush and I'm home again

Stepping through the door with the night in store, whiling just an hour away
Step into the sky in the starbright, feeling it's a brighter day

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

Let's make sugar darlin', sweet surrender

(Y,o,u,r,e,g,o,r,g,e,o,u,s)

Remember that tank-top you bought me?
You wrote ""you're gorgeous"" on it
You took me to your rented motor car
And filmed me on the bonnet

You got me to hitch my knees up
And pulled my legs apart
You took an Instamatic camera
And pulled my sleeves around my heart

Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through

You said my clothes were sexy
You tore away my shirt
You rubbed an ice cube on my chest
Snapped me till it hurt

Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through

You said I wasn't cheap
You paid me twenty pounds
You promised to put me in a magazine
On every table in every lounge

Because you're gorgeous
I'd do anything for you
Because you're gorgeous
I know you'll get me through

527,One Headlight,Bringing Down The Horse,The Wallflowers,1996-01-01,312626,70,"

[Verse 1]
So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

[Verse 2]
I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
So I wondered why she hung around this place

[Bridge]
Hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We'll put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

[Verse 4]
She said, ""It's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade""
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

[Verse 5]
And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

[Bridge]
Hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 6]
Well, this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
What smells of cheap wine, cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn

[Verse 7]
I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
The city walls of dying dreams
I think her death, it must be killing me

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

LUTRICIA MCNEAL
He was a very special warm and gentle person
Who put in music in the world and spoken in rhyme
And it hurts me that i never really knew him
Cause all it would have taken was some time

You know he always seemed to be there when i stumbled
And when mountains got to steep for me to climb
And it tears me up to think i never touched him
Cause all it would have taken was some time

Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
But not gettin' into someone i should know

Now he's in another place and i can't reach him
And i feel as though i'm guilty of a crime
I took all he had to give and gave him nothin'
And all it would have taken was some time

Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
But not gettin' into someone i should know

Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
But not gettin' into someone i should know

Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere

Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
Gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down

529,If You Could Only See,Lemon Parade,Tonic,1996-07-15,261519,65,"

[Chorus:]
If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

[Verse 1:]
Well you got your reasons
And you got your lies
And you got your manipulations
They cut me down to size

[Bridge 1]
Sayin' you know but you don't
You give your love but you won't

[Chorus]
If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

[Verse 2]
Seems the road less traveled
Shows happiness unraveled
And you got to take a little dirt
To keep what you love
That's what you gotta do

[Bridge 2]
Sayin' you  know but you don't
You give your love but you won't
You're stretching out your arms to something that's just not there
Sayin' you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can

[Chorus]
If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

[Bridge 2]
Sayin' you  know but you don't
You give your love but you won't
You're stretching out your arms to something that's just not there
Sayin' you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can

[Bridge 2]
Sayin' you  know but you don't
You give your love but you won't
Stretching your arms
Sayin' you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can

[Chorus]
If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

[Verse 1]
To really love a woman
To understand her - You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Verse 2]
To really love a woman - Let her hold you
'Til you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody

Oh - You got to give her some faith - Hold her tight
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right

You really gotta love your woman

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one

See my girl, she shivers in her bones

There's a fire between us, so where is your God?
There's a fire between us
I can't get off the carousel, I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off the carousel, I can't get off this world

I killed you all, I killed you all
I killed..
I killed you all, I killed all

It's time to terminate the great wide world
Morbid fascinations, television takes control
Decimation, different races fall
Electronic information tampers with your soul

There's a fire between us, so where is your God?

I ain't got no mothafucking friends
What y'all niggas talking about?
Hell yeah I'ma do this mothafucking track
And they know exactly who I'm  talking about, too, you old bitch-made niggas

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
'Cause uh, niggas talk plenty shit, so many tricks
I fucked your bitch 'cause I'm true to this, witness the hit
You talk bad 'bout a nigga when I got blasted
Hope you made a little money while the funk lasted
Heard they call you Big Poppa nigga, how you figure?
'Cause to me you'll always be a phony fat nigga
I can't be copied even wearing Versace, nigga you run or ruck
Scared as fuck, if the guns would bust
Now niggas talk I got a list of player haters and fakes
You bitch niggas getting blown away
You cross-eyed Down syndrome crack baby
So you and Puffy are tough? Now that's crazy
I got your ass in my sight, niggas dying tonight
We screaming, ""West Side for life""
And I can't wait to see you niggas in traffic 'cause we gonna get 'em up
When you see me, you better bust
'Cause I'ma hit 'em up

[Hook: 2Pac]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga we hit 'em up

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
It's hard to explain, this wasn't my thang when I was younger
Before my shit, I swear to God, I'll leave you stiff just to make a come up
Niggas run up, 'cause more murder for the money
Got caught up tryna make a harder record, should've been on check[?]
'Cause I bet you and it's for life
You never gon' see a nigga like me wanting a battle up on T.V
I'd rather release some of these
And put a slug to you busta-ass niggas that continue to squeeze
I got some niggas back in Jersey that rather be jacking cars
And robbing bitch niggas like y'all for emergency
Let's take it back to the West Side
Them niggas sure gonna be riders and plus we Thug Life niggas, so call us multiply
Finger on the trigger, bitches stand and rise
But we don't trust 'em and they might be the first that we gon' bust on
Just label me a ""Bad Boy Killer""
Do Mobb Deep bitches gonna feel us when we turn into killers?
Hit 'em up

[Verse 3: E.D.I Mean]
Now this is me, BK all day, ain't no Bloodin', ain't no Crippin'
Strictly Bad Boy killer, shoot that ass like a squealer
Now let this motherfucka top down, I'm finna drop rounds
Letting these sounds, pop and then I hop up
Seeing them shatter, shooting my shit to work a lease go
What's up to the riders in a L.A. Long Beach on up to the East O
Shooting at you, C-Lo, circle, this is yo virtue
The beef for the rest of [?] meant to turn you purple
Wanna take no fame for being enemies to the game
Who'll get that ass tamed, simple and plain, y'all know the name
Drama, riders, through the whole line up
Niggas get tired of dumpin' with they gat four
Then we mobbin' through they hood slow
No need for running 'cause we's don't give a fuck
Besides beforehand, we gots to hit they ass on up

Get out the way, yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got shot
And I'm a true eagle storming, nigga laced your fat ass in California
I catch you on any East Coast corner and you's a goner
Puffy weaker than fucking block, I'm running through nigga
And I'm smoking Junior M.A.F.I.A in front of you nigga
With the ready power, tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty sour, I push packages every hour
My sons past moon slapping nickels on glass 40s
So hand me the cash, you made on the ave
But that’s yo' ass shorty
I got a team of simple bout-able souls
Move my ears like Yoda, quick as a cobra and never sober

[Verse 5: Kadafi]
I'm on a 12 O' Clock cruise to Brooklyn and I'm looking
For the thrill to see in your barrel ready to get his life tooken
So where you killers at? it's bang trick? don't tempt me to
Leave your coward ass stripped in a full clip emptied in your stomach
Jewels and all, yeah nigga run it
Dropping all you cowards that be jackin' a nigga behind it
You done just about made it an impossible to escape
Another 'mergency visit to the hospital I can't wait
To meet up with all you bitches in the streets
So I can leave all you cowards leaking in your fucking seats
When we hit 'em up

If you a big bad mothafucka, come step to this

Yo, Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow-wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up, girl)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

[Verse 3: Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low-key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Oh, yeah)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up, babe)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, play on)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a **** thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We bes the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-**** broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your **** Chauncy
I'll be sending the call, let's say, around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity (No diggity, no doubt, baby)

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hey, ooh)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hell, yeah, babe)

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent (No doubt)

Kindness in your eyes
I guess you heard me cry
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
I'm blessed I know
Heaven sent and heaven stole
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all this pain
I thought I never feel the same about anyone or anything again
But now I know

[Chorus]
When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

[Verse 2]
Sadness in my eyes
No one guessed and no one tried
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
Loveless and cold
With your last breath you saved my soul
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
And what have I learned from all these tears
I've waited for you all those years
Then just when it began he took your love away
But I still say

[Chorus]
When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

[Verse 3]
So the words you could not say
I'll sing them for you
And the love we would have made
I'll make it for two
For every single memory
Has become a part of me
You will always be my love
Well I've been loved so I know just what love is
And the lover that I kissed is always by my side
Oh the lover I still miss... was Jesus to a child

In the government yard in Brooklyn
Oba-observing the crookedness
As it mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost

For pain of losing family

And babes and babes and babes and babes and babes
And remembering nothing boy, when you like my tin horn boy
And get wet like an angel, derail

[Verse 2]
You got a velvet mouth, you're so succulent and beautiful
Shimmering and dirty wonderful
And hot times on your telephone line
You got to never land on your telephone and in walks an angel

[Verse 3]
And look at me, your mum squatting pissed in a tube hole
At Tottenham Court Road, I just come out of The Ship
Talking to the most blonde I ever met
Shouting, ""Lager, lager, lager, lager""
Shouting, ""Lager, lager, lager, lager""
Shouting, ""Lager, lager, lager, lager""
Shouting, ""Lager, lager, lager""
Shouting ""Mega, mega white thing, mega, mega
White thing, mega, mega white thing, mega, mega""
Shouting, ""Lager, lager, lager, lager
Mega, mega white thing, mega, mega white thing""
So many things to see and do in the tube hole, true blonde
Going back to Romford, mega, mega, mega
Going back to Romford, hi mum, are you having fun?
And now are you on your way to a new tension and headache?

[Intro: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
Now tell me, what ya gonna do
(Now, tell me what...)
When it ain't nowhere to run
When judgment comes for you
When judgment comes for you?
Now tell me, what ya gonna do
(Now, tell me what...)
When it ain't nowhere to hide
When judgment comes for you
'Cause it's gonna come for you?

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Dead souls, nigga, this for Wally
Eazy, C's Uncle Charlie
Little Boo, but God's got him
And I'm gonna miss everybody
I done rolled with blows like AIDS
Looked at him while he laid and prayed
But destiny played too deep for me to say
Lil' Layzie came to me
Told me if he should decease, ""well, then please
Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me.""

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days
God is who we praise
Even though the Devil's all up in my face
But He keepin' me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race
Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won't budge
Grudge, because there's no mercy for thugs
Ooh, what could I do?
It's all about a family and how we roll
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We livin' our lives to eternal our souls, hey-o-ayo

[Bridge: Krayzie Bone]
Pray and we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day
And we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Still we lacin'

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Now follow me, roll stroll
Whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit to the people that's long gone, they rest: Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
And still keepin' up with they family
Exactly how many days we got lastin'?
While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away
God, rest our souls
'Cause I know I might meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know, y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs, baby

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
Lil Eazy long gone
Really wish he could come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go, bye bye
All a lil' thug could do was cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dawg?
Damn, man, I miss my Uncle Charles, y'all
And he shouldn't be gone
In front of his home, what they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, was so wrong
Gotta hold on, gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on, lean on

[Bridge: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]
Pray and we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day
And we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray

[Chorus: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads

[Post-Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody (long gone, long gone)
And I'm gonna miss everybody (long gone)
And I'm gonna miss everybody (long gone)
And I'm gonna miss everybody (long gone, long gone)
And I'm gonna miss everybody

[Bridge 2: Layzie Bone]
Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me (straight to Heaven)
That's how we roll
Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me (straight to Heaven)
That's how we roll
Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me (straight to Heaven)
That's how we roll
And I asked the good Lord why
He sighed, he told me we live to die

[Verse 5: Krayzie Bone]
What's up with that murder, y'all?
See, my little cousin was hung
Somebody really wrong, anybody wanna test us, dawg?
And Ms. Sleazy set up Eazy to fall
You know while we sinnin'
He intendin' on endin' it when it ends
He comin' again and again and again
Now tell me, what ya gonna do?

[Verse 6: Wish Bone]
Can somebody anybody tell me why, hey
Can somebody anybody tell me why
We die, we die?
I don't wanna die
(Oh so wrong, oh wrong, oh so wrong, oh wrong)

[Chorus: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]

552,Cold Rock a Party,Bad As I Wanna B,MC Lyte,1996,247306,52,"

[Intro]
(To the beat y'all! To the beat y'all! Just clap your hands, just clap your hands...)
To the L, to the Y and the T to the E
So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me
(Rock the house, rock the house, rock the house)

[Hook]
Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

[Verse 1]
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred
I'm a veteran, which means that I've been
In the game too long, since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I flow like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Spectacular over M-I-C
I go for broke, never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request
You like the rhyme, bite if you dare
I get the paper so I don't care
Fly that's me; the epitomy
Of what a real MC is supposed to be
Fucking you up every time that I drop
I fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look, it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
It's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun
If you don't understand then say you don't (nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best (say what?)
West to East, see East to West
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive
Cause it's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics
I got many witnesses that can back this
Ruffnecks, from New York to L.A
Been down with me since Poor George
It's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
Make the ill type moves, I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Get out my shit, please let me be
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that
Trying to get over like a fat rat
But I understand I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop
It goes on, on, on, on
You see, the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver
Chilling with
A pina colada, kidada hooked me up
With Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere, that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you?
You better get down with your real crew
'Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it yeah?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alizé
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Nigga shot ya from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?

Beneath the riverbed

Close your eyes and bow your head
I need a little sympathy
'Cause fear is strong and love's for everyone
Who isn't me
So kill your health and kill yourself
And kill everything you love
And if you live you can fall to pieces
And suffer with my ghost

I shot my love today, would you cry for me?
I lost my head again, would you lie for me?
I left her in the sand just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again, would you cry for me?

It's just an anchor on my heart
It's just a tumor in my head

Where the moon is glued to a picture of heaven
And all the little pigs have God

Chokin' amateurs till they vomit

JD:
I make 'em sick cause I'm the williest

DA BRAT:
Too much for you to deal with
My ni**as that ride quick
Survive or die bitch

JD:
Why switch this remix hurts everyday
It's like this and I never stop puttin it in work
I rock from L.A. to Dru Hill
Something you can feel
All I'm about is that dolla dolla bill
What the deal?

DA BRAT:
Funkier than parliment
Stay bent behind tent
Keep ni**as payin' my rent
My goldier scent lingers
VVS describes best what's on the fingers

JD:
We make believers out of dreamers

DRU HILL:
Somebody's sleepin' in my bed
(Sleepin' in my bed)
Messin' with my head

Takin' my place
Sleepin' in my bed
Messin' with my head
(Said I can't sleep baby)
Takin' my place

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me (Yo)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill]
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake (Yeah)
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their four hundred-pound mate
If I could rule the world (If I ruled the world), everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto. of course, when giddy-upping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me (Yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Gore-Tex and sweats, I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo, I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies (Ha)
So while you imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away from these scars I got, oh, baby
Hey, baby, ‘cause I got a lot, oh, yeah
And anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know, oh, baby
Hey, baby, you can't hide from the block, oh, no

[Verse 3: Pras, Pras & Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber (Drop bombs)
Crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die (He's super fly)
Toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes, sir)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (Ayo, nobody move)
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide (Ayo, nobody move)
Gonna find you and make you want me (Come on)
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (You know the—)
Gonna find you and take it slowly (You know)
Ready or not (Uh-huh), here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

563,Ambitionz Az A Ridah,All Eyez On Me,2Pac,1996,278386,71,"

[Intro]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

[Verse 2]
It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
(That's all you niggas got?)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

[Verse 1]
I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well, you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know, or seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

[Chorus]
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

[Verse 2]
So I guess the fortune teller's right
Should've seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins, and now

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can touch, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real

A few questions that I need to know
How you could ever hurt me so
I need to know what I've done wrong
And how long it's been going on
Was it that I never paid enough attention?
Or did I not give enough affection?
Not only will your answers keep me sane
But I'll know never to make the same mistake again
You can tell me to my face or even on the phone
You can write it in a letter
Either way, I have to know
Did I never treat you right?
Did I always start the fight?
Either way, I'm going out of my mind
All the answers to my questions, I have to find

[Verse 1: Melanie & All]

Didn't they say that I would make a mistake?
Didn't they say you were gonna be trouble?
People told me you were too much to take
I couldn't see it, I didn't wanna know

I let you in, and then you let me down
You messed me up and you turned my life around
Left me feeling I had nowhere to go
I was alone, how was I to know that

You would be there when I needed somebody
You would be there the only one could help me

I had a picture of you in my mind
Never knew it could be so wrong
Why'd it take me so long just to find
The friend that was there all along

Who'd believe that after all we've been through
I'd be able to put my trust in you
Goes to show you can forgive and forget
Looking back I have no regrets 'cause

You would be there when I needed somebody
You would be there the only one could help me

I had a picture of you in my mind
Never knew it could be so wrong
Why'd it take me so long just to find
The friend that was there all along

You would be there when I needed somebody
You would be there the only one could help me

[Intro]
So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the peace in every eye

Doo doo doo doooo
Doo doo doo doooo

[Verse 1]
She had two babies, one was six months, one was three
In the war of '44
Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh, would her son grow to know his father?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be... sorry?

Doo doo doo doooo
Doo doo doo doooo
Doo doo doo doo doooo

[Verse 2]
He showed up all wet on the rainy front step
Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw lives inside him still
It's so hard to be gentle and warm
The years pass by and now he has granddaughters

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now, what will it be?
I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be?

[Verse 3]
Ohhh, so look at me from across the room
You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me, I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
Ohh, so breathe a little more deeply
All we have is this very moment
And I don't wanna do what his father
And his father, and his father did
I wanna be here now

So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the peace in every eye

I don't wanna wait for our lives to be over

[Verse 1]
I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man, I had a master plan
But I was alone

[Verse 2]
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh, what a night it's been and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone

[Bridge]
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone (always end up alone)
Always end up alone

[Chorus]
So I play, I'll wait
Cause you know that love takes time
We came so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

[Verse 3]
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone

[Verse 4]
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Cause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate?
Am I the subject of the pain? Am I the stranger in the rain?
I am alone

And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told

[Chorus]
So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

[Bridge]
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told

[Chorus]
So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

[Outro]
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone

Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home

Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone

Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean

And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home

I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate?
And do they know the places where we go
When we're grey and old?
'Cause I've been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Chorus]
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Verse 2]
When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one-way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Chorus]
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one

""Mama never loved her much
And Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away
From human affection.""

She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot to come

And crimes that were never defined

""Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith
Is, is like a journey

So, baby's gonna take a dive
And push the shift to overdrive

Been searching all along
Came facing twilight on and on
Without a clue
Without a sign
Without grasping yet
The real question to be asked
Where have I been?

I'm a shapeshifter
At Poe's Masquerade
Hiding both face and mind
All free for you to draw
I'm a shapeshifter
What else should I be?
Please don't take off my mask
Revealing dark

Moments of calm
Nothing left to be found
A mirror right in front of me
That's where I find
An empty glass
Reflecting the sad truth
It's telling words not to be told
I need the mask

I'm a shapeshifter
At Poe's Masquerade
Hiding both face and mind
All free for you to draw
I'm a shapeshifter
Chained down to my core
Please don't take off my mask
My place to hide

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch, we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset

Your legend ever will

May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed yourself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

[Outro]
Your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

[Verse 1]
I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling
She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she say

[Chorus]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Verse 2]
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

[Pre-Chorus]
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

[Chorus]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Bridge]
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

[Chorus]
And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
In the place we used to start our lives

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time

You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees

These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

[Verse 2]
You're always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art
Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must've gone off track with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Excuse me
Think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself

And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

Stood in the rain

Somebody's got to choose
We can make it if we try, for the sake of you and I
Together we can make it right

What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

[Bridge]
You've got the right to lose control
Don't let go
Don't let go 'cause I can't pretend

[Verse 1: Babyface]
There was a girl I used to know
She was oh so beautiful
But she's not here anymore
She had a college degree
Smart as anyone could be
Had so much to live for

[Pre-Chorus]
But she fell in love
With the wrong kinda of man
He abused her love and treated her so bad
There was not enough education in her world
That could save the life of this little girl

[Chorus]
How come, how long?
It's not right, it's so wrong
Do we let it just go on?
Turn our backs and carry on?
Wake up, it's too late
Right now, we can't wait
She won't have a second try
Open up your hearts
As well as your eyes

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder]
She tried to give a cry for help
She even blamed things on herself
But no one came to her aid
'Nothing was wrong as far as we could tell'
That's what we'd like to tell ourselves
But no, it wasn't that way

[Pre-Chorus]
So she fell in love
With the wrong kinda of man
And she paid with her life
For loving that man
So we cannot ignore
We must look for the signs
And maybe next time we might save somebody's life

[Chorus]
How come, how long?
It's not right, it's so wrong
Do we let it just go on?
Turn our backs and carry on?
Wake up, it's too late
Right now, we can't wait
She won't have a second try
Open up your hearts
As well as your eyes

[Harmonica solo]

[Bridge: Babyface + Stevie Wonder]
Oh, I on occasion met that guy
He stirred a feeling deep inside
Someth'n' about him wasn't right
Oh, the way he proves himself a man
By beating his woman with his hands
I wish that she had seen the light
How can someone like this call themselves a man?
(He's not a man)
'Cause in reality he's far more less than
And we cannot ignore whenever we see the signs
'Cause any kind of abuse God knows is a crime

[Chorus]
How come, how long?
It's not right, it's so wrong
Do we let it just go on?
Turn our backs and carry on?
Wake up, it's too late
Right now, we can't wait
She won't have a second try
Open up your hearts
As well as your eyes

I had a dream last night
You were there
You held my hand so tight
I thought I'd just die
Do you remember
When we use to have so much fun
I used to cry sometimes
Those days are gone
Do you remember?

I wanna go back to
Back to the days
When I needed
A little more fun
When I believed I
I believed I
Could fly so high
Through the clouds

Tear down these walls
If just for one day
Tear down these walls
I need you to stay
Stay!

Come on and stay
Stay
Stay

Turning back time to
Times we made love
All day
Under the sun
When I believed I
I believed I
Could fly so high
Through the clouds

Tear down these walls
If just for one day
Tear down these walls
I need you to stay
Stay!

Come on and stay
Stay
Stay

[Verse 1]
All bet, song set
All black everything
Can’t afford to see ‘em die
Pawn that wedding ring
Screams throughout the congregation
Sunday best is soaking wet
Tensions thick as shackles
And the casket ain’t been open yet
Babies feel the elders’ pain
They crying but they don’t know what’s wrong
But it won’t be long
Grief make you get your grown folk on
Choirs singing
Half are in the spirit
Half don’t hear it
Halfway broken
Met demise but met the maker
Pastor said it
Hard to see through blurry vision
Puffy-eyed, there’s mercer[?] victims
Word is healing
Some with comfort
Others here but spurn religion
Hallelujah while the mama holler too soon
But finally breaks her
And I relate but men don’t cry
We’re too cool so I refrain
See more die then get degrees
But who decides what’s meant to be
From suicide to centuries of you and I vs bigotry
Hope that heavens waiting
Maybe death is taking life’s control
But tell them that to his family
Right my bad, I’m quiet, eyes are closed

[Chorus]
Got my black shoes, got my black suit, oh
Tribute tattoos, R-I-P shirt, oh
Heard the bad news, left me confused, dumb
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Funeral processions
Mothers clutching casket handles
Dignified in shambles
Numbed in pain, no answers
The result of deadly force abused by fools with badges
White supremacists with mental illness and mega privilege
Can’t explain the pain
Galaxy await
[?] displays the love
Our foster raging hate
Justice is overdue
And I can hardly wait
My people know the truth
They speak it everyday
Politicians, those cowards deliver fake flowers
Helicopters they hover, big brother, state power
Bullets flowing endless, victims mainly defenseless
Not the aggressor, they reckless, police enforce repression
A life meaningless, fuck it now, I get tomorrow
Deepest sorrow, my soul hollow, no role models
COINTEL did them well, may they rot in hell
They been plotting our demises since we developed cells

[Chorus]
Got my black shoes, got my black suit, oh
Tribute tattoos, R-I-P shirt, oh
Heard the bad news, left me confused, dumb
(x2)

[Verse 3]
Got bodied by 12, then carried by 12
Men
All cried their tears
When no one was near
Them
Black life is in season
We grieving this evening
Abusing the rules and it happens too frequent
Eulogy while in your youth is nothing new to me
Even with the proper proof immune to scrutiny
Apparently my destiny is die from weaponry
We pouring out
Bottles
I bought extra Hennessy
No therapy gon’ give a nigga longevity
A rarity is making past age 70
Long as melodies play, we gon’ stay heavenly
Soon as we leave this space, it might get deadly
Money hungry on that power struggle
Quick to bring a trouble
Scared the youngins, waiting, getting scuffled
Must be slavery, muscle run up on your leave, you’re late in puddles
Mothers left to wondering, the moment’s notice
Life can turn to shambles, dreams will crumble

[Chorus]
Got my black shoes, got my black suit, oh
Tribute tattoos, R-I-P shirt, oh
Heard the bad news, left me confused, dumb

Summer stretching on the grass
Summer dresses pass
In the shade of a willow tree
Creeps a-crawling over me
Over me and over you
Stuck together with God's glue
It's gonna get stickier too
It's been a long hot summer
Let's get under cover
Don't try too hard to think
Don't think at all

[Chorus]
I'm not the only one
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find
If you take a look inside
Not just deaf and dumb
I'm staring at the sun
Not the only one
Who's happy to go blind

[Verse 2]
There's an insect in your ear
If you scratch it won't disappear
It's gonna itch and burn and sting
Do you wanna see what the scratching brings?
Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach
Will we ever live in peace?
Cause those that can't do often have to
And those that can't do often have to preach

[Chorus]
To the ones
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'll find
If you took a look inside
Not just deaf and dumb
Staring at the sun
I'm not the only one
Who'd rather go blind

Intransigence in all around
Military's still in town
Armour plated suits and ties
Daddy just won't say goodbye
Referee won't blow the whistle
God is good but will he listen?
I'm nearly great but there's something missing
I left it in the duty free
Oh, though you never really belonged to me

[Chorus]
You're not the only one
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find
If you stepped back inside
I'm not sucking my thumb
Staring at the sun
Not the only one
Who's happy to go blind

A kingdom alone, but no love to confess

[Verse 1: Coolio]
Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinkin'
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin' and smokin'
Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy? 'Cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
Cause my crew is rollin hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no mo'
Uh, I guess that's just the way it go
I ain't tryin' to preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there

[Chorus]
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

[Verse 2: Leek Ratt]
More temptation than faith, I guess we livin for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught slippin when they come and do all the gettin
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta later start
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'mma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there waitin with the sounds bumpin

[Chorus]
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

[Verse 3: P.S. Pookie]
You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryina stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if you're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side

[Chorus]
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

[Outro: Coolio]
As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ooh, baby)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit'
You make me, you make me (Make me, you're makin' me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit'
You make me, you make me

[Verse 1: Usher]
Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how...

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, babe)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit'

Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' (Oh yeah)

[Verse 2: Usher]
Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowin' it should've been you
And what's sad is that I love her, but I'm fallin' for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Say what you do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' (Ah, yeah)
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' (Yeah-hey)
You make me, you make me

[Bridge: Usher]
At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go (Gotta let her go)
And if she may not understand it while all of this is goin' on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me (You make me wanna)

You make me wanna (Oh)

You make me wanna (Go on, babe, do your thing)
You make me wanna (Ooh, ooh-ooh yeah)

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)

616,Tell Him,Higher Ground,Barbra Streisand,1997-10-28,290533,44,"

I'm scared
So afraid to show I care
Will he think me weak
If I tremble when I speak
Oooh
What if
There's another one he's thinking of
Maybe he's in love
I'd feel like a fool
Life can be so cruel
I don't know what to do

I've been there
With my heart out in my hand
But what you must understand
You can't let the chance
To love him pass you by

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
I'll hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Touch him (Oooh)
With the gentleness you feel inside (I feel it)
Your love can't be denied
The truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be
All in time you'll see

Oooh
I love him (Then show him)
Of that much I can be sure (Hold him close to you)
I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Blind faith will lead love where it has to say

Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Whisper words so soft and sweet
Hold him close to feel his heart beat
Love will be the gift you give yourself

Oooh
Never let him go

[Verse 1]
It ain't no joke I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
This is a love attack, I know it went out but it's back
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
And just like fashion it's a passion for the with-it and hip
If you got the goods they'll come and buy it
Just to stay in the clique

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the sun

[Verse 2]
Twenty-five years ago they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singing and clapping, man, what the hell happened?
Then some were spellbound some were hell-bound
Some they fell down and some got back up and
Fought back against the melt down
And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the sun

[Verse 3]
It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus
So don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked
News at ten, your neighborhood is under attack
Put away the crack before the crack puts you away
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the sun

[Outro]
You might as well be walking on the sun
You might as well be walking on the sun
You might as well be walking on the sun
You might as well be walking on the sun

Susie's got your number (Ah)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Step off the train all alone at dawn
Back into the hole where I was born
The sun in the sky never raised an eye to me
The blood on the trax and they must be mine
The fool on the hill and I feel fine
Don't look back 'cause you know what you might see

Look into the wall of my mind's eye
I think I know, but I don't know why
The questions are the answers you might need
Coming in a mess, going out in style
I ain't good looking but I'm someone's child
No-one can give me the air that's mine to breathe

[Bridge 1]
I met my maker, I made him cry
And on my shoulder he asked me why
His people won't fly through the storm
I said ""Hey, listen up man, they don't even know you're born""

[Chorus 1]
All my people right here, right now
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)
All my people right here, right now
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)
All my people right here, right now
D'you know what I mean? (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't really care for what you believe
So open up your fist or you won't receive
The thoughts and the words of every man you'll need
So get up off the floor and believe in life
No-ones ever gonna ever ask you twice
Get on the bus and bring it on home to me

[Bridge 2]
I met my maker I made him cry (yes you did)
And on my shoulder he asked me why
His people won't fly through the storm
I said ""Listen up man, they don't even know you're born""

[Chorus 2]
All my people right here, right now
They know what I mean (yeah, yeah)
All my people right here, right now
They know what I mean (yeah, yeah)
All my people right here, right now
They know what I mean (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All my people right here, right now

Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang

Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head, she sang

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder
When I sing along with you

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

[Verse 3]
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
And out of your head, out of my head I sang

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder
When I sing along with you

If everything could ever feel this real forever

[Verse 1: Wanya & Nate]
I long for
The warmth of
Days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

[Verse 2: Nathan & (Mike)]
Remember
The nights when (remember the night)
We closed our eyes (when we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
Everytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

[Bridge: Wanya & (Mike)]
This loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same)

Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn

[Bridge]
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

[Verse 2]
Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe in
The things we find behind the door

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me, nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows, the way it's gonna be

If you're leaving will you take me with you?
I'm tired of talking on my phone
There is one thing I can never give you
My heart will never be your home

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know

In a way, it's all a matter of time
I will not worry for you, you'll be just fine
Take my thoughts with you, and when you look behind
You will surely see a face that you recognize

[Chorus]
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

[Verse 2]
It is the distance that makes life a little hard
Two minds that once were close, now, so many miles apart
I will not falter, though, I'll hold on 'til you're home
Safely back where you belong, and see how our love has grown

[Chorus]
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind, baby, there's time to be with me
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time

Maybe your mama gave you up, boy
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl

Star people
Counting your money until your soul turns green
Star people
Counting the cost of your desire to be seen

I do not count myself among you
I may be living in a dream
It's just there seems so many of you
Can't help but hope there's a difference between...
You and me

(You're a star)
I'm talking to you
And you should go far (you're a star)

I said, maybe your mama gave you up, boy
(It's the same old same old)
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl
(Say, how much is enough?)

Star people
Never forget you're secret's safe with me
Just look at all the wonderful people
Trying to forget they had to pay for what you see

It's a dream
With a nightmare stuck in the middle
But listen, brother, where would you be
Without all this attention?
You'd die, I'd die, we'd die
Wouldn't we?
Well wouldn't we?
(You're a star)

I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
(you're a star)


I said, maybe your mama gave you up, boy
(It's the same old same old)
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl
(How much is enough)

You only wanted them to love you
You may have been living in a dream
And as the demons tower above you
You bite your tongue when you really wanna scream

(How much is enough?)
Look at me

I said
Talk about your mother
Talk about your father
Talk about the people who have made you what you are
Talk about your teacher
The bully boy who beat you
Talk about the people who have paid for that new sports car

You're a big, big, big, big star
Look at you

(How much is enough?)
How much is enough?
Did you get off on a bad foot, baby?
Do you have a little tale to tell?
Did you get off on a bad foot?
Bad, bad foot?
Is that why you're a star?
Is that what makes a star?
(How much is enough)
How much is enough?

(Did you get off on a bad foot, baby?
Do you have a little tale to tell?
How much is enough?)

How much is enough?

Babe
Now, nothing comes from nothing, baby
That fame and fortune's heaven sent
And who gives a fuck about your problems, darling
'Cause you can pay the rent?
How much is enough?

You got niggas that don't like me for whatever reason
You got niggas that don't wanna see me rich
You got niggas that's mad cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggas that just don't like me
You know the, those PHD niggas
But you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though
See it's a difference
A lot of niggas pop shit
But a lot of niggas don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit
We come to bring it to y'all niggas, me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever, Black Rob
If you wanna dance, we dance

[Verse 1: Mase]
Now trick what, lace who, that ain't what Mase do
Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face boo not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny never find that, Puff a dime stack
Write hot shit and make a nigga say, rewind that
Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo
Getcha ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door
I represent honeys with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says okay my tint smoke gray
No way, nigga leave without handing me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my six
Niggas outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship

I was in one bedroom, dreaming of a million
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling

Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins
Hoes of all complexions
I like cinnamon
Mase you got some hoes well nigga send em in
What you waiting for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz...)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way
It's hot and hazy, never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there, girlfriend, I'm ticklish
And I be switching ve's with a wrist full of G's

Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks
I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car

[Intro: LL Cool J]
Oh my God, you know

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
I'm the best when it comes to makin' love all night
Throw your butterscotch body beneath the red light
Blaze it up girl, I'ma lace it real tight
Go deep 'til the full moon turn to sunlight
'Til the darkness is gone love remains strong
Like the bond between mother and child, you're so warm to the touch
Passionate interludes is such
When your gone, your body's what I yearn to clutch
Just imagine ecstasy floatin' in a cloud
Animal attraction burnin' through the crowd
Heaven on Earth, paradise for a price
It's cool though, I'll pay it for the rest of my life, you know why

[Chorus: Chaka Khan sample (LL Cool J)]
Ain't nobody does me better
Makes me happy, makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody does me better

(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)
(You can take it girl, stop runnin', uh)

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
I'm explorin' your body and your erogenous zones
Like a black tiger caged up, 'til you come home
Lovely, you make a man swoon like a boy
The love is so soft, it gets hard to enjoy
Cause the mind flies, and sometimes the sex lies
Smooth little girls fall in love with rough guys
But you can chop a big heart down to pint size
I guess that's what it sounds like when the dove cries
Uh, the whole world is trapped up in a maze
But you save this real good lovin' for rainy days
Uh, the lord works in mysterious ways
He must have put you on this Earth for all men to praise

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
As I travel through your body our souls become one
Indivisible, uh, it's getting critical son
I'm on the run from love, it chased me out the bag
Get the point boo, you hit it right on the head
It's an endless adventure, two bodies collide
King fulfilling dreams with a queen by his side
Forever, infinite time we intertwine
Destiny, we fall in love by design
What's yours is mine and what's mine is yours
The road less travelled is ours to explore
I adore you, heavenly angel shine light
Hold my hand, I'll be your guide through the night

[Chorus]

[Interlude: LL Cool J]
Come on now, a man chooses a woman
A woman chooses a man, give you half for a second
Then I'll give you the full plunge, uh
What you want? What you want? What you want?
Ice out infiltrates the scenery, nahmean
It's bananas ain't it

[Chorus]

Have a feeling, now believing that you
Were the one I was meant to be with
Oh how I’m wishing, thinking, dreaming
Bout you, and the love
How’d I ever let you get away

[Manipulated Joni Mitchell sample]
Don’t it always seem

That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone

[Verse 2: Janet]
If I could turn back the hands of time
Make you, fall in love, in love with me again
So would you give me another chance to love
To love you, love you the right way, no games

Got til it's gone
Joni Mitchell never lies

[Refrain: Joni Mitchell]
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
One two, one two, yo
Let me just fuck with it for a minute, what
(that you don't what you've got til it's gone)
Now you realizing when them nights go long, right
Campaign for me to stay when you know that I’m gone, right
You act all wild, when I tell you to settle
I was working round the clock, but your girls want to meddle
Talk about I heard he swims with this chick on the beach
That was out with the tide but my love you impeach
Now you looking at the walls, head in hands, cold jonezin
Ringing my house, hanging up and imposing

[Interlude: Q-Tip]
And why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
And why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
And why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh
And why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Now why you wanna go and do that

Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone
Don’t it always seem to go
That you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone

Just tell me what you've got to say to me
I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth
It comes as no surprise at all you see
So cut the crap and tell me that we're through
Now I know your heart, I know your mind
You don't even know you're being unkind
So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways
Just use me up and then you walk away
Boy, you can't play me that way

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

[Chorus]
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

[Verse 2]
When I saw my best friend yesterday
She said she never liked you from the start
Well me, I wish that I could claim the same
But you always knew you held my heart
And you're such a charming, handsome man
Now I think I finally understand
Is it in your genes
I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

Well, I guess this is growing up

Could you whisper in my ear?
The things you wanna feel
I'd give you anything
To feel it comin'
Do you wake up on your own
And wonder where you are?
You live with all your faults

[Bridge]
I wanna wake up where you are
I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide?
Yeah, I'm gonna let it slide

Don't you love the life you killed?

Your father hit the wall
Your ma disowned you

What it means to be a man
Or something I can just change
I live around it

I won't say anything at all
So why don't you slide

[Verse 1]
I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate?
And do they know the places where we go
When we're grey and old?
'Cause I've been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head
And I feel that love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Chorus]
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call
She won't forsake me
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Verse 2]
When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one-way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm lovin' angels instead

[Chorus]
And through it all
She offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me

Giving life from within
Like a love song never heard
Slipping through our fingers
Like the sands of time
Promises made
Every memory saved
As reflections in my mind

Hasta mañana
Always be mine

[Chorus: All]
Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Back where I belong now
Was it just a dream?
Feelings unfold
They will never be sold
And the secret's safe with me

[Pre-Chorus: All]
Hasta mañana
Always be mine

[Chorus: All & (Sporty)]
Viva forever (viva forever), I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Everlasting (everlasting), like the sun (like the sun)

Ever searching (ever searching) for the one (for the one)
Viva forever (viva forever), I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever (live forever), for the moment

And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now

[Verse 2]
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight

[Chorus]
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

It's been so long since we have talked

I just don't know what I'm doing wrong

What can I do to make you love me

What can I say to make you feel this
What can I do to get you there

There's only so much I can take
And I just got to let it go

No matter what they tell us
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach us
What we believe is true

No matter what they call us
However they attack
No matter where they take us
We'll find our own way back

I can't deny what I believe
I can't be what I'm not
I know I'll love forever
I know, no matter what

If only tears were laughter
If only night was day
If only prayers were answered
Then we would hear God say

No matter what they tell you
No matter what they do
No matter what they teach you
What you believe is true

And I will keep you safe and strong
And sheltered from the storm
No matter where it's barren
A dream is being born

No matter who they follow
No matter where they lead
No matter how they judge us
I'll be everything you need

No matter if the sun don't shine
Or if the skies are blue
No matter what the ending
My life began with you

I can't deny what I believe
I can't be what I'm not
I know, I know
I know this love's forever

That's all that matters now
No matter what

Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

663,Lullaby,Soul's Core,Shawn Mullins,1998-09-15,329866,50,"

[Verse 1]
She grew up
With the children of the stars
In the Hollywood Hills and the boulevard

Her parents threw big parties
Everyone was there
They hung out with folks
Like Dennis Hopper and Bob Seger
And Sonny and Cher

She feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage
I can tell that

She can`t let go and she can`t relax
And just before
She hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby

[Chorus]
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Rockabye

[Verse 2]
She still lives with her mom outside the city
Down that street
About a half a mile
And all her friends tell her she`s so pretty

But she`d be a whole lot prettier
If she smiled once in a while
Cause even her smile looks like a frown
She`s seen her share of devils in this angel town

[Repeat Chorus]
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Rockabye

[Verse 3]
I told her
I ain`t so sure about this place
It`s hard to play a gig in this town
And keep a straight face
Seems like everybody`s got a plan
It`s kind of like Nashville with a tan

[Chorus]
Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye
Rockabye
Everything`s gonna be all right

Everything`s gonna be all right

Please let her know that I'm well

[Verse 1: Braille]
Yo, microphone master coming on the track
The loud speaker blaster, what they chasing after
That's the question, we're searching for answers
Does your path lead to life or disaster
You start running faster, who do you race against
The time in the hour glass is wearing thin
We're all wearing skin, we're all in this flesh
Acting like businessmen, but we got no business since
The wages of sin is death, we can't avoid it
Chase the American dream and get disappointed
What's the point of this, I try to point them
In the right direction, and the pastor anointed him
But he didn't feel it, maybe it's more than that
More than a feeling or emotion, more than a moment
How do you teach a man to be consistent
To see the big picture and refocus his vision
I'm fishing for clues in a big sea
This is the big leagues, so much bondage, I'm trying to get free
Rush hour traffic, I just wanna exit
I just wanna understand the meaning to the message
In the music, I wanna know the truth so I can take it
And spread it all over this heavy rotation

[Chorus]
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
The world keeps spinning, the world keeps spinning
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
We're underrated, we're highly anticipated
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
It's been a long time coming but we waited
Can you handle the weight, can you handle the weight
Can you handle this heavy rotation

[Verse 2: Sivion]
Sivion on this track again
I'm breaking bread with some brothers that are free from sin
Building bonds, though we utilizing beats and pens
Let this music make a change in the streets of men
As the world turns, let this guiding light be with you
And feed all my children with the wisdom to get through
The hurdles and the barriers from people that dis you
A poor self image and respect is the issue
Get a tissue cuz this dude ain't missing you
Or that crap rock you copped for me to listen to
Man, I'm fixing to get at you cuz my rhymes'll spit at you
With the truth and the proof that your vibe is pitiful
And miniscule, fool, fit the ridicule
Little bitty sounds just right for the kiddy pool
Use this gritty tool worldwide filling many shoes
Heavy rotate feel the great stop to many crews

[Chorus]
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
The world keeps spinning, the world keeps spinning
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
We're underrated, we're highly anticipated
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
It's been a long time coming but we waited
Can you handle the weight, can you handle the weight
Can you handle this heavy rotation

[Verse 3: Kaboose]
There's no time to waste so I find a place
That I can escape gravity's hold and find the brakes
And do what it takes
Life moves fast, it's not willing to wait
So you might go crash with every chance that you're willing to take
To fill in the blanks you gotta live it out, learn from mistakes
Enter this race and always run with passion
Take each breath cuz this could be your last one
Reach for the stars, you're the coming attraction
Life is too short, you gotta take action
Even when you fall and things are drastic
Pick yourself up and hit the gas quick
Hold on tight as you move through the traffic
With your aim steady, no hesitation
Let's get it moving in this heavy rotation

(One two, one two, the world keeps spinning)

[Chorus]
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
The world keeps spinning, the world keeps spinning
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
We're underrated, we're highly anticipated
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
It's been a long time coming but we waited
Can you handle the weight, can you handle the weight
Can you handle this heavy rotation

Je m'appelle, Melle Mel
Donne moi la petit mademoiselle
Donne moi cinq, donne moi six
Donne moi huit, neuf, dix

I'm seeing this girl that what I never saw before

I had to let her know just about my thing
I'm the M, R, N E-Double S
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test
And I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess

Rahiem in your life, what more can you ask
I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Rahiem

Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my sleeve
Only one fine lady, that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game

Well I'mma Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree
On top of the world for the ladies to see
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot
Gonna make everybody wanna rock rock rock
Gonna do it to the East, wanna do it to the West
Gonna make you relax right upon your chest

Grandmaster Flash is willing and able
He's the king of the cuts on two turntables
He's the GRAND, GRAND, the master man
He's so nice with his hands he don't need no band
Rocks 45's and 33's
Rocks boys, men, women, and young ladies
He can slice so precise it's almost fun
And he makes better love than a mint makes money

The moment I let go of it
Was the moment I got more than I could handle
The moment I jumped off of it
Was the moment I touched down

How 'bout no longer being masochistic
How 'bout remembering your divinity
How 'bout unabashedly bawling your eyes out
How 'bout not equating death with stopping

Thank you India
Thank you providence
Thank you disillusionment
Thank you nothingness
Thank you clarity
Thank you, thank you silence

Hell is gone and heaven's here
There's nothing left for you to fear
Shake your ass come over here

I'm a burning effigy
Of everything I used to be
You're my rock of empathy, my dear

So come on, let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

[Verse 2]
Life's too short for you to die
So grab yourself an alibi
Heaven knows your mother lied, mon cher
Separate your right from wrongs
Come and sing a different song
The kettle's on, so don't be long, mon cher

So come on, let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

He popped a pill and fell asleep
The dew is wet but the grass is sweet, my dear

Your mind gets burned with the habits you've learned
But we're the generation that's got to be heard

So come on, let me entertain you

[Verse 1: Scary & Baby]
Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep but meaningless words to me
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end

[Pre-Chorus: Sporty]
Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me (pleases me)
But short term solution ain't no resolution
That ain't no release for me

[Chorus: All]
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast

[Pre-Chorus: Sporty]
Yes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me

Too much of something is bad enough (bad enough)

Too much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough)

What part of no don't you understand

Too much of nothing is just as tough

Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie

Baby, keep a little two for me
She could be sweet sixteen, bustin' out at the seams
It's still love in the first degree

When he's at my gate, with a big fat eight
You wanna see the smile on my face
And even at my door, with a poor poor four
There ain't no man can replace

Cause we love our love in different sizes
I love her body, especially the lies
Time takes its toll, but not on the eyes
Promise me this, take me tonight

If he's extra large, well I'm in charge
I can work this thing on top
If he's XXL, well what the hell

[Chorus 1: Steven Page]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
""Get your act together, come back and see me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

[Verse 1: Ed Robertson]
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson and Steven Page]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

[Chorus 2: Steven Page]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

[Verse 2: Ed Robertson]
Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson and Steven Page]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

[Chorus 3: Steven Page and Ed Robertson]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, ""I'm sorry""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

[Outro: Steven Page and Ed Robertson]
It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say ""Wasabi""

Look at the sky
All the stars, man, the stars is beautiful tonight
Look at 'em

Ghetto supastar (Supastar)
That is what you are (That's what you are)
Coming from afar (Coming from afar)
Reaching for the stars (Reaching from the stars)
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh (Yeah)
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 1: Pras]
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got hopes and dreams, we got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me? I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic legalese; no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'ma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Letting bygones be bygones, and so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat how to live in the ghetto
Keeping it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
Pa-Pa-Politic with ghetto senators on the D-low

Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar (Uh-huh)
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 2 : ODB]
One, two, and you don't stop, yo!
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Tryna find what's really going on in the streets

[Verse 3: Pras]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree
Kick your balls like Pelé, pick 'em doing ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yelling, ""Ole!""
Who the hell wanna save me?, From B.K. to Cali

Ghetto supastar (Come on, uh)
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 3: Pras]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
Two-faced, getting defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

[Verse 4: ODB]
Well, I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hanging out
Partying with girls that never die, you see, I was
Picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood

[Chorus: Mya & (Pras)]
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh

From one corner to another, uh-huh (yeah)

Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me (Sing it, baby) to another place (Sing it, baby)
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh, and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

[Chorus]
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

[Verse 2]
So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

[Chorus]
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

To open up my heart
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule

And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing
Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream
Only wish that you were here

To show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me

Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
Yo my cardio is infinite, ha-ha
Big Willie style's all in it
Gettin' jiggy wit it

[Verse 2]
What?
You want to ball with the kid?
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all
Ya don't stop in the winter or the (Summertime)
I makes it hot
Gettin' jiggy wit 'em

[Verse 3]
Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?
Don't be silly

[Intro]
Every mornin' there's a halo hangin' from the corner
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it
For the weekend or a one-night stand

[Verse 1]
Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again, as predicted, left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reelin'
Stopped me from believin'
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
You know I wanna do it again

[Chorus]

Oh

Oh

Every mornin' there's a heartache hangin' from the corner

Turn me around again

If I could tell the world just one thing
It would be that we're all OK
And not to worry 'cause worry is wasteful
And useless in times like these
I won't be made useless

I will gather myself around my faith
For light does the darkness most fear

My hands are small, I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own

Poverty stole your golden shoes
It didn't steal your laughter
And heartache came to visit me
But I knew it wasn't ever after
We'll fight, not out of spite
For someone must stand up for what's right
'Cause where there's a man who has no voice
There ours shall go singing

My hands are small I know
But they're not yours, they are my own
But they're not yours, they are my own
And I am never broken

- Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
- Uh-huh, sure. You know, you look kinda familiar
- Yeah, you do too. But um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named...? You, you know his name
- Oh yeah, definitely. I know his name
- Well, I just wanna let you know that he's mine
- Ha, no, no, he's mine!

[Chorus: Brandy]
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

[Verse 1: Brandy & Monica]
I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
You see, I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
You see, I tried to hesitate
I didn't wanna say what he told me
He said without me, he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (The boy is mine)

[Chorus: Brandy (& Monica)]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (Oh)
The boy is mine (Boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Confused)
He belongs to me (Oh)
The boy is mine

[Verse 2: Monica & Brandy]
Must you do the things you do?
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me, not you
And if you didn't know it, girl, it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth, you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine, oh (The boy is mine, oh-oh)

It's not hard to see (To see)

Seem to be confused (You seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine

[Bridge: Monica & Brandy]
I can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games, I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start (The boy is mine)

[Chorus: Brandy, (Brandy & Monica)]
You need to give it up (Give it on up)
Had about enough (Had about enough)
It's not hard to see (It's not hard to see)

I'm sorry that you (I'm sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine (No, no)
You need to give it up (You need to give it up)
Had about enough (About enough)
It's not hard to see (It's not hard to see)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Mine, oh)
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)

I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudiced
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is
(Repeat these lines til fade)

[Intro]
Let's go outside
Let's go outside
Let's go outside
Let's go outside
Back to nature
Outside
Human nature
Back to--

[Verse 1]
I think I'm done with the sofa
I think I'm done with the hall
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby

[Chorus]
Let's go outside, in the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yes
Let's go outside, in the moonshine
Take me to the places that I love best

[Verse 2]
So my angel she says ""don't you worry
'Bout the things they're saying, yeah
Got no friends in high places
And the game that you gave away wasn't worth playing""

[Chorus]
Let's go outside, in the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yes
Let's go outside, in the meantime
Take me to the places that I love best

[Post-Chorus 1]
And yes, I've been bad
Doctor won't you do with me what you can
You see I think about it all the time
24/7
You say you want it, you got it
I never really said it before
There's nothing here but flesh and bone
There's nothing more, nothing more, there's nothing more
Back to nature, just human nature
Getting on back to -

[Verse 1]
I think I'm done with the sofa
I think I'm done with the hall
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby

[Chorus]
Let's go outside, in the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yes
Let's go outside, in the moonshine
Take me to the places that I love best

[Interlude]

[Post-Chorus 2]
And yes, I've been bad
Doctor won't you do with me what you can
You see I think about it all the time
I'd service the community, but I already have you see
I never really said it before
There's nothing here but flesh and bone
There's nothing more, nothing more, there's nothing more

[Outro]
Let's go outside
Dancing on the D-train baby
When the moon is high
And the grass is jumpin'
Come on, just keep on funkin'
Keep on funkin', just keep on funkin'

I like the feel of your name on my lips
And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
The way that your fingers run through my hair
And how your scent lingers even when you're not there

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two-hour bath
And how you've convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane

But I love the way you love me, oh, baby
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul so completely
I love the way you love me

And I like the sound of old R 'n' B
And you roll your eyes when I'm sloppily off key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
From sappy old movies you've seen thousands of times

And I love the way you love me, oh, baby
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul so completely
I love the way you love me

So listen to me now

And I could list a million things
I love to like about you (About you)
But they could all come down to one reason (To one reason)
I could never live without you

I love the way you love me, oh, baby
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul completely
I love the way you love me

I love the way you that love me

This year's love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
I've been waiting on my own
Too long
And when you hold me like you do
It feels so right, oh now
I start to forget how my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on

[Verse 2]
Turning circles and time again
Cut like a knife, oh now
If ya love me got to know
For sure
'Cause it takes something more this time
Than sweet, sweet lies, oh now
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul

[Pre-Hook]
When ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet

This year's love it better last
This year's love it better last

'Cause who's to worry if our hearts get torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Don't ya know this life goes on

Singing ain't this life so sweet

[Verse 1: Stephan Jenkins]
I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore
Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
""I wanna get out of this""
I wonder is there anything
I'm gonna miss

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there?
How's it going to be
When there's no one there to talk to?
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?

[Verse 2: Stephan Jenkins]
Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be
When you're not around?
How's it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me?
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

[Bridge: Stephan Jenkins]
And how's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore?
And how's it going to be?
Wanna get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
I wanna taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion (Oblivion)

[Outro: Stephan Jenkins]
How's it going to be?
When you don't know me anymore?
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?

Life
Mysterious Life
We're moving around, dancing the rhythm of life
Time
Mysterious Time
We're counting the hours and days to the end of all time

We are feeling a change
And we don't know why
Choose one direction
Just one for a time
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind
And these are mysterious times

Mysterious times
No trick of the mind
For this moment I feel
Like we live in mysterious times
If you see what's behind
These are mysterious times

Soul
I feel my soul
For this moment nobody can stop me from flying so high
Real
Nothing is real
In a world of illusion you only see what you feel

We are feeling a change
And we don't know why
Choose one direction
Just one for a time
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind
And these are mysterious times

Mysterious times
No trick of the mind
For this moment I feel
Like we live in mysterious times
If you see what's behind
These are mysterious times

If you see what's behind
These are mysterious times

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry?
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night?
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right?
Have you ever, have you ever?

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been in love
Been in love so bad
You'd do anything to make them understand?
Have you ever had someone steal your heart away
You'd give anything to make them feel the same?
Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart
But you don't know what to say
And you don't know where to start?

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry?
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night?
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right?
Have you ever, have you ever? Ooh

[Verse 2]
Have you ever found the one
You've dreamed of all of your life?
You'd do just about anything to look into their eyes
Have you finally found the one you've given your heart to
Only to find that one won't give their heart to you?
Have you ever closed your eyes and
Dreamed that they were there
And all you can do is wait for the day when they will care?

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry? (Make you wanna break down and cry)
Have you ever needed something (So, so bad)
So bad you can't sleep at night?
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right? (Oh)
Have you ever, have you ever, ever ever? Ooh

[Bridge]
What do I gotta do to get you in my arms, baby?
What do I gotta say to get to your heart
To make you understand how I need you next to me?
Gotta get you in my world
'Cause, baby, I can't sleep

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry?
Have you, have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night?
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right? Ooh
Have you ever, have you ever?
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry?
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night (Just can't sleep at night)
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right? (Don't come out right)
Have you ever, have you ever, ever, ever?
Ooh, have you ever?

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They made up their minds and they started packing
And left before the sun came up that day
An exit to eternal summer slacking
But where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Verse 2]
They drank up the wine and they got to talking
But now had more important things to say
And when the car broke down, they started walking
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
They'll never get hungry
They'll never get old and grey
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home, but they really don't care
They wanted the highway
They're happier there today, today

[Verse 3]
The children woke up, and they couldn't find them
They left before the sun came up that day
They just drove off and left it all behind 'em (Leavin' it all behind)
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?

[Chorus]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
They'll never get hungry
They'll never get old and grey
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home, but they really don't care
They wanted the highway
They're happier there today, today

You will always be the girl

Saying ""You, can't, front""
So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat
And what I do be the Major League
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door
Shotgun in my drop, having fun
With the Don, system bassing, conversation
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, ""Give it to me now, baby""

[Chorus: Usher]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

[Verse 3: Usher]
Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far, then, ooh wee!
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
And I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it...

[Chorus: Usher]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

[Verse 1]
I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

[Verse 2]
Baby, can you feel me?
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far, like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

So you face it with a smile
There is no need to cry
For a trifle's more than this

Will you still recall my name?
And the month it all began
Will you release me with a kiss?

Have I tried to draw the veil?
If I have - how could I fail?
Did I fear the consequence?

Dazed by careless words
Cosy in my mind

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

Now you shaped that liquid wax
Fit it out with crater cracks
Sweet devotion, my delight

Oh, you're such a pretty one
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
Would tease me through the night

Now I hate to leave you bare
If you need me I'll be there
Don't you ever let me down

Dazed by careless words
Cosy in my mind

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

And I touched your face
Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane

And I called your name
Like an addicted to cocaine
Calls for the stuff he'd rather blame

And I touched your face
Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane

And I called your name
My cocaine...

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

I don't mind...

Them get money niggas the ones to plot the scheme with

The ones that would always measure my triple beam with
Until they start taking my niggas to the precinct

Hurry up 5

Sometimes I'm unforget cooth
My S5 bulletproof

And blast right through your motherfucking roof
Coming through
Hitting you
Knocking out a nigga's tooth
Full speed ahead like we running a toll booth
Produce more flavor than Very Fine juice
Call a truce
Before me and my niggas'll let loose

Bleach the heat
You're letting loose to the extreme
Me and the Iceburg S5 bounce from the scene
Recline my seat rock to the beat
Leaning so hard, it's like my whole squad up in the Jeep
Blowing up the spot or we hit them know what I mean
Got you open we keeping you niggas up like caffine
Flying guillotine
Seeing everything on my little computer screen

Gas me you ossen a nigga with kerosine

Hot shit making you niggas forever feen

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady, you a basehead"" (Uh-uh)
""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole""

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?

Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know

Sometimes I run (Sometimes)
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
All I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time

I'll just hang around and you'll see
There's nowhere I'd rather be
If you love me, trust in me
The way that I trust in you
Ah, ooh, yeah

[Intro]
Ow
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist

[Chorus]
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve—just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
’Cause heaven forbid it should fall outta place

Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt

That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, uuh)

Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Yeah

[Verse 3]
You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
Come on, baby, tell me, you must be joking, right?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, you think you're something special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you've got a car

[Chorus]
That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, uuh)
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much (Don't impress me)
Oh, oh no, you think you're cool, but have you got the touch?
Now, now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night

Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

Okay, so what do you think, you're Elvis or something?
(Whatever)
That don't impress me

I've been wandering around the house all night
Wondering what the hell to do
Yeah, I'm trying to concentrate but
All I can think of is you

Well, the phone don't ring cause my friends ain't home
I'm tired of being all alone
Got the TV on cause the radio's playing
Songs that remind me of you

Baby, when you're gone

Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Baby, when you're gone
Yeah

I've been driving up and down these streets
Trying to find somewhere to go
Yeah, I'm looking for a familiar face
But there's no one I know

It feels like I'm gonna go insane
I hope you're coming back real soon
Cause I don't know what to do

[Verse 1]
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may I can never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

[Chorus]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

[Verse 2]
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Try as they may they could never define
What's been said between your heart and mine

[Chorus]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best, you say it best, when you say nothing at all

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh, the smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best, you say it best, when you say nothing at all

[Outro]
You say it best when you say nothing at all
You say it best when you say nothing at all
That smile on your face
The truth in your eyes, the touch of your hand
Let's me know that you need me
You say it best when you say nothing at all

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

Day after day
Time passed away
And I just can't get you out of my mind
Nobody knows, I hide it inside
I keep on searching but I can't find
The courage to show to letting you know
I've never felt so much love before
And once again I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out

But if I let you go I will never know
What my life would be holding you close to me
Will I ever see you smiling back at me? Oh yeah
How will I know if I let you go?

Night after night I hear myself say
Why can't this feeling just fade away
There's no one like you (no one like you)
You speak to my heart (speak to my heart)
It's such a a shame we're worlds apart

But sooner or later I gotta choose
And once again I'm thinking about

In our castle in Spain
You’ll be living rent-free
Every capital gain
You’ll share with me
From this village below
Every cent, we will drain
And your fortune will grow
In our castle in Spain

[Verse 2]
Every mortgage and lease
I will revaluate
And for you, I’ll increase
Their interest rate
You’ll eat nothing but cake
You’ll drink naught but champagne
You’ll be in on the take
In our castle in Spain

Surely, you must agree
That it makes your head whirl
To be marrying me
You lucky girl
You have caught me today
In a generous way
Come now, what do you say?
To our castle in

If my heart keeps singing
Will my song go winging
To someone who’ll find me
And bring back a love song to me?

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumping, it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
Oh

Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wasting my feelings on you
Loving you means so much more

[Verse 1]
I don't need your sympathy
There's nothing you can say or do for me
And I don't want a miracle
You'll never change for no one
And I hear your reasons why
Where did you sleep last night?
And was she worth it, was she worth it?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go

[Verse 2]
So you feel misunderstood
Baby have I got news for you
On being used, I could write the book
But you don't wanna hear about it
'Cause I've been losing sleep
And you've been going cheap
She ain't worth half of me, it's true
Now I'm telling you, that

[Chorus]
I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go

[Bridge]
Come hell or waters high
You'll never see me cry
This is our last goodbye, it's true
I'm telling you, now

[Chorus]
I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go
Now I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
This Mambo Number 5!

[Verse 1]
One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on, let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice, but I really don't wanna
Beer-bust, like I had last week
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue you know they gettin' sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me flirtin' is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

[Chorus]
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha!)
Mambo Number 5! (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this, then you're doin' it right

[Chorus]
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha!)

[Bridge]
(Ha!) Trumpet!
The trumpet!
Mambo Number 5!
Ha-ha-ha!

[Chorus]
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ooh!)

[Outro]
I do want to
Fall in love with a girl like you
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky

I wanna know
Who ever told you I was letting go
Of the only joy that I have ever known
Girl, they're lying
Just look around
And all of the people that we used to know
Have just given up, they wanna let it go
But we're still trying

So you should know this love we share was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one way street just you and I 
Just you and I

And I swear it all over again
All over again

Some people say
That everything has got its place in time
Even the day must give way to the night
But I'm not buying
'Cause in your eyes
I see a love that burns eternally
And if you see how beautiful you are to me
You'll know I'm not lying

[Pre-Chorus]
Sure there'll be times we wanna say goodbye
But even if we try
There are something's in this life won't be denied
Won't be denied

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna say goodbye

The more I know of you is the more I know I love you
And the more that I'm sure I want you forever and ever more
And the more that you love me, the more that I know
Oh, that I'm never gonna let you go
Gotta let you know that I

Yeah, yeah
Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete, I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?
I never thought that love could feel like this
And then you changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel? It's a miracle
Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you, oh
A little more time, yes he did, babe
In all of creation, all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world
And then I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child
That's deep inside, it leaves me purified
Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
On you on you on you, you, on you on you, on you, you
I never thought that love could feel like this
And then you changed my world with just one kiss
And how can it be that right here with me
There's an angel? It's a miracle
Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you, you

The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

Be in the position that made me feel
So damn unpretty
Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too

Never insecure until I met you, now I'm bein' stupid

[Intro]
Yeah, I like it when the girls stop by in the summer
Do you remember, do you remember
When we met that summer?

[Hook]
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

[Verse 1]
Hip hop, marmalade, spick-and-span
Met you one summer and it all began
You're the best girl that I ever did see
The great Larry Bird, Jersey 33
When you take a sip, you buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willy Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
Somethin' in your eyes really drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and never came back
Stayed all summer, then went back home
Macaulay Culkin was in Home Alone
Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton
When I met you, I said my name is Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie & Fitch

[Hook]
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

Cherry Pez, Coke Crush, Rock Stud, Boogie
Used to hate school, so I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the B-boy style
Known to act wild and make a girl smile
Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Reminds me of you 'cause you rock my world
You come from Georgia, where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade and speak real slow
You love hip hop and rock and roll
Dad took off when you were four years old
There was a good man named Paul Revere
I feel much better, baby, when you're near
You love Fun Dip and Cherry Coke
I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You looked like a girl from Abercrombie & Fitch

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by

I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

[Verse 3]
In the summertime, girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey, like I stole your bike
Boogaloo Shrimp and pogo sticks
My mind takes me back there oh so quick
Let you off the hook, like my man Mr. Limpet
Think about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it
I like The Color Purple, macaroni and cheese
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees
Call you up, but what's the use?
I like Kevin Bacon, but I hate Footloose
Came in the door, I said it before
I think I'm over you, but I'm really not sure
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You looked like a girl From Abercrombie & Fitch

[Hook]
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick

Summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worthwhile, and some are s- so
Summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worthwhile, and some are so so

Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike

[Hook]

She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She calls me heartbreaker
When we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
Scribble down ""I hate ya"", but she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does, and all

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Oh boy, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me
(Why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start
(Right from the start that you'd)
You'd go and break my heart (Go and break my heart)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me?
(I should have known) I should have known right from the start
(That you would go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Boy, if I do) Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
(The things you want me to)
(The way I used to do)
Oh, why did you have to (Would you love me, baby?)
Run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
(Or leave me feeling used) Right from the start
(Would you go and break?) (My heart)
You'd go and break my heart

[Outro: Mariah Carey & JAY-Z]
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love

That we should be together

Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

Some in their solitary nights
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You've found that special thing

Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

[Verse 2]
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

[Interlude]
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon
Go for the moon

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

[Verse 3]
Somebody once asked, ""could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place""
I said, ""Yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself and we could all use a little change""

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

[Outro]
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

They say around the way you've asked for me
There's even talk about you wanting me
I must admit that's what I wanna hear
But that's just talk until you take me there

Haven't we met?
You're some kind of beautiful stranger

Here I am
Broken wings
Quiet thoughts
Unspoken dreams
Here I am
Alone again
And I need her now
To hold my hand

She's all, she's all I ever had
(She's the air I breathe)
She's all, she's all I ever had

It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I wanna be
She's all I'll ever need

So much time
So much pain
But there's one thing
That still remains
The the way she cared
The love we shared
And through it all
She's always been there

When the sky turns grey and there's no end in sight
When I can't sleep through the lonely night

[Intro: Tim & Matt]
Hey, Matt
Yeah, Tim?
Hey, you talked to Marc lately?
Uh, haven't really talked to him but he looks pretty, uh, down
""He looks pretty, uh, down?""
Yeah, well, maybe we should cheer him up then
What do you, uh, suppose we should do?
Well, does he like butter tarts?

[Verse 1: Marc]
I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Chorus: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

[Spoken: Tim & Chad]
Chad, come here, come here, come here
Wow, look at her
I know
Man, I've never seen Sharon look so bad before
I did once before, but this is pretty bad
Yeah, what do you think she got up to last night?
Well, I... Sharon, I love you!

[Verse 2: Sharon]
I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Chorus: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

[Chorus 2: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's done for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Not some and hard to see
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping dumb and built to beat
(If you steal my sunshine)

[Outro: Marc & Sharon]
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine

You know, it's kinda hard just to get along today
Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway
He may not have a clue and he may not have style
But everything he lacks, well, he makes up in denial

[Refrain: Dexter]
So don't debate, a player straight
You know he really doesn't get it anyway
Gotta play the field, and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way
So if you don't rate, just overcompensate
At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake

Hey, hey, do that brand-new thing!

But they didn't have Ice Cube, so he bought Vanilla Ice
Now cruisin' in his Pinto, he sees homies as he pass
But if he looks twice, they're gonna kick his lily ass

So don't debate, a player straight

Now he's gettin' a tattoo, yeah, he's gettin' ink done

That I'll be loving you always

Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (you know it's gonna be always)
Until the day that is the day that I'm no more

Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear (cause you're here)

Until the ocean covers every mountain high (been loving you)
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea (loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (now ain't that loving you?)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (allllllllways)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (I'll be loving you forever)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (alllways)
Until the day that is the day that I'm no more (extended) (yeahhhhh)

775,Tell Me It's Real,It's Real,K-Ci & JoJo,1999-06-22,278600,54,"

[Chorus]
Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try
It's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

[Verse 1]
Baby, you told me that you love me and you'd never leave my side
Through the bitter end, through the thick and thin
You promised me, baby, that you wasn't going anywhere, yes you did
Baby, keep it real, let me know just how you feel

[Chorus]
Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try
It's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

[Verse 2]
I can't explain the way you make me feel
Everytime that you tell me that you love me
And you know you did, so many times
Just when I thought that love could never be a part of me
That's when you came along
And showed me happiness
Baby, you are the best
I think you're different from the rest
I really love you

[Chorus]
Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try
It's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

[Bridge]
Tell me it's real
This feeling that I feel
Tell me it's real
For your love
I will do anything

[Chorus]
Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try
It's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

[Outro]
Do you really love me? Do you really care? You promised that
You'd never leave my side, you promised that you'd always be there
And Momma told me take it slow
Boy you just don't know
Anything about love
If you and I were meant to be
You would know
It would show
By the end of the son

776,You Needed Me,The Love Songs Collection,Boyzone,2003-03-17,208773,44,"

You needed me

I cried a tear
You wiped it dry
I was confused
You cleared my mind

I sold my soul
You bought it back for me
And held me up
And gave me dignity

Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength
To stand alone again
To face the world
Out on my own again

You put me high
Upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity

You needed me
You needed me

And I can't believe it's you
I can't believe it's true
I needed you
And you were there

And I'll never leave, why should I leave
I'd be a fool
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares
(You needed me)

You held my hand
When it was cold
When I was lost
You took me home

You gave me love
When I was at the end
And turned my lies
Back into truth again

You even called me ""friend""

You gave me strength (You gave me strength)
To stand alone again (To stand alone)
To face the world (To face the world)
Out on my own again (On my own)

You put me high
Upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity

You needed me
You needed me

You needed me
You needed me
Oh, yes, you needed me
You needed me

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a payphone
I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail
This state looks down on sodomy

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And are still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again? What's my age again?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus with Tom DeLonge]
And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
(What's my age again? What's my age again?)
That's about the time that she broke up with me (Please stay with me)
No one should take themselves so seriously (Please stay with me)
With many years ahead to fall in line (Please stay with me)
Why would you wish that on me?
(Please stay) I never wanna act my age
(With) What's my age again? (Me) What's my age again?

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
What's my age again?

[Verse 1]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

[Verse 2]
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me
And it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Chorus]
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life

[Verse 3]
Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

[Chorus]
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life

[Verse 1]
You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

[Chorus]
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

[Verse 2]
Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together
Whoa, oh, no, no, no, ooh
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again, mmm
Ohh

[Chorus]
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again (Oh baby, yeah, yeah)
I had a dream, you and me
Will find ourselves in love again, yeah
I still believe (Ooh baby, I do)
Someday you and me (Just give me one more try)
In love again, yeah
I had a dream (I miss your love)
Someday you and me (Mmm, mmm)
Will find ourselves in love again (Ahh, ahh, oh)

Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

[Chorus]
Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Verse 1]
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight up ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires, the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

[Chorus]
Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Verse 2]
When I woke up, the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me, darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night

[Chorus]
Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

Where am I, how did I get here?
Today is very different than yesterday
So this is the world?  I miss my old womb
The wallpaper here just ain't the same

This world is something strange
I'm wet, I'm cold, I need a change
This world is something new to me

Oh, my head! What is this? I can't take it!
Me either!

I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm irritated
But I love the extra leg room
Man! They cut my cord!
Consider yourself lucky!

This world is way too big
And populated by fuzzy pigs
This world is something new to me

This world is such a gas
P.U., where's your class?
This world is something new to me

Quiet! can't a guy get some shuteye?
It's so noisy in here
I can barely hear myself suck

The food here tastes pretty good
My compliments to the chef
And you gotta holler to get fed
But I could get used to that

This world is way too bright
Can't somebody turn down the light?
So that's what that thing looks like

All things here are meant for play
It's gonna be a real cool day
This world is something new to me

This world is something new to me

Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay

In this salsa- merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay papi!""
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An' if you ask how I know, I gots ta plead the fifth

Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
(Made me cry)
What'd you do to me?
Can't take what you did to me

[Verse 2: Whitney Houston]
Now I see, that you've been doing wrong
Played me all along
And made a fool of me, baby (Ah)
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheating on me, baby
How could you do it to me?

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Price & (Faith Evans)]
Since you're not around for me
To tell you, baby, face to face (Mmm-mm)
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say, oh

[Chorus: All (Kelly, Whitney)]
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? (All you did was lie to me, baby)
Look what you did to me (Can't believe what you did to me, yeah)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? (Why'd you do it?)
Can't take what you did to me
You didn't have to do it to me, baby

This is the Heartbreak Hotel (All I wanted!)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (This the heartbreak)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (Welcome to heartbreak)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (Yeah, why'd you do it?)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel

[Chorus: All, Kelly (Kelly, Whitney, Faith)]
All I really wanted was some of your time (Oh, baby)
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? (Ooh, all I really wanted, ahh)
Look what you did to me (It's all I really wanted, baby)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me?
Can't take what you did to me
I wanted your love
All I really wanted was some of your time (All I really want)
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? (Do me right, can't take it no more)
Look what you did to me (Why did you do me that way?)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
(Thought you'd do me right)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
(But you made me cry)
What'd you do to me? (Ohh-whoa-ohh-oh)

[Outro: Whitney]
I ain't gon' to take it, I ain't gon' take it no more
I ain't gon' to take it, boy

Everything that you said was a lie
Don't lie to me

Yo this is Shavo from System of a Down
I wanna welcome you to the Armenian Emcee Cypher 2020 You know we had to bring it back
R-Mean get ‘em bro

[R-Mean]

Yeah

My people left forsaken
I came to bless the nation
Where’s satan? Im God’s amazement of his own creation
Forever scarred still we grinding till this hunger starves us
We heartless with more heart than like 300 Spartans
This survivor’s genetics God is our witness
This shit David vs Goliath
We lions leave the giant bеheaded
We likе soldiers in the trenches here to defend
So we flood the streets like Azeris flood my DMs
So when a bunch of black G-wagons pulling up
Heat packing these cats got the streets backing turning up
Emcees lacking the talent and deep passion
Instead they just keep yappin’ Oh yes they indeed cappin’ sure enuf Ease back and just know we don’t be slacking
Relaxing
Sounding sharp as feedback when Mean rapping turn him up
Its simple mathematics
I’m better than 99. 999 % of these rappers
Dawg R been a monster
Word to Drizzy I’m a pop star and a doctor
Embody Kobe and Nipsey together
R Dash if I die tonight I live forever


[Franco Drew]

Fighting for the Land of the Lost I pray that God with us
We united & we stand for the cause & never fall victim
I can’t believe what I be watching in awe Forgive me Lord I’ve been dreaming of the moment it’s ours
And never goes missing
I’ve been feeling like a minute man
I need a minute man
It’s been a minute many men been steady biting many hands The Richard Millie on my wrist been like a quarter million
I’m Milli Rocking on the beat & bill a condominium
On a chase for all this paper
I’m dodging all the fake ones
Truffle covered steak and caviar all on my plate uh
24 Gs up in my pocket from these 8ths uh
81 up on the board I’m feeling like a Laker
This for my brothers in arms we’re making history
When I heard the pressure is on don’t hope it get to me
Victimizing all of my people and it’s offending me
If I catch an Ottoman motherfucker I’ll catch a felony


[One-2]

I served a couple dimes and moved to real ounces
Served a little time with goons in jail houses
I’m from the block, Posted outside Little Caesar’s
I roam the streets like Julius Caesar in Rome
I’m a King, wear a crown of thorns made of barbed wire
Those who cross me get caught in the crossfire
Son of God, member of the lost tribe
Lived my whole life on the dark side
I hopped outta Noah’s Ark on Mt. Ararat
And walked alongside the Lord like Joan Of Arc
I’m like the Lion in our Coat Of Arms
Defiant, tho I came close to dying -
I’m still holding on
R told me to get ‘em
So I’mma hit ‘em til’ I got ‘em
When it comes to our people you know we ridin
My posse be goonin’ I cock heat and shoot ‘em
Uno, I’m like a modern day Monte Melkonian


[Hrush]

Yeah I call the shots I say when
Put it on my name that Y-A-N
This one’s for my people, for my dear cusin
When you been through real pain you don’t fear nothing
We connected going hard all you bitches soft
Only female in the room who the biggest boss?
Had to take a break I went on a hiatus
Guess what now I’m back yelling hi haters!
Wish ‘em well wish ‘em well We don’t kiss and tell
Drippin’ in Chanel, Did that ring a bell”
Told your man please get to stepping but he trip and fell
So fly they call me heaven when I give ‘em hell



[BlackJack]

Represent cultures that never got their acknowledgement
One facing racists the other based on the politics
They brought the logic to slaughter taught by the Ottomans
So how we not gon’ pop when we Bishop beefing with Radomes God vs a Goblin-agnostic and we apostles
The prophets speaking the gospel that promise to breed the knowledge
In solace..breathe with the heart of our martyrs of modern massacres Masterminded by fascists that’s backed by a fucking bastard
A cabinet of fucking maggots that’s passive on all the havoc
That’s chanted that ‘All Life Matter’ now inactive with all that cappin’ So I’m speaking on that rare wave (ay) Fuck about no air play (ay)
I’m ridin' with my soldiers hollaring “Karabakh a merne”
Ain’t never been a fair play just open wounds and stolen borders Supported by thwarted orders forcing out the rightful owners
And the world's speaking volumes by staying silent
At the line of a genocide and you quiet based on alliance
And hiding behind a bias so whether Chump or it’s Biden
The government funds supplying the rockets you seen ‘em flying!
But the lion eating hyenas and rising above the demons
United fighting for freedom to silence the side of evil


[Drew]

This 40 blow the condiments up out your melon
They put me on the stand but i told em I ain’t telling
These bitches stick you up and use the pussy as a weapon
She got a Gucci bag with no cash or no credit
I’m turning tables
Double cross me you get crucified
I don’t need no Judas nah
Hit em with the Ruger, BYE
Smoking on my opp in this backwood when I’m gettin high
And tell my brothers out in Artsakh, let em fly
I wanna see dem bitches toe tagged
Taking out innocent kids they ain’t got no soul man
I’m sayin fuck AZ but not the rapper though
And fuck Gigi Hadid Bella Hadid and whoever backing them
We gon’ leave them opps looking holy like the motherland
Hashtag haxtelquenq I’ll bet a hundred bands
This chopper make you dance and do the running man
Started wit with a couple grams and now my stacks in rubber bands

[Verse 1]
Someday, when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why, you were always there for me
One way, in the eyes of a passer by
I'll look around for another try and they'll fade away

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave as you reach for me

[Verse 2]
Some say, better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say, you were always there for me
Some way, when the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time and they fade away
And fade they away

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave as you reach for me

Someone said we tried too long (Someday will pass me by)
Someone said we got it all wrong (Someday, I wonder why)
Someone said we tried too long (Someday will pass me by)
Is there a place where I belong? (Someday will)

So far
So long
So far away
So far
So wrong
So far away away away

Someday, when my life has passed me by

Ha-Ha! Well now, we call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about

(I'd appreciate your input)

Sweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House hash browns
Come quicker than FedEx, never reach an apex, just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early, just like Daylight Savings Time

Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals

Love, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it
Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific: I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means ""Small Craft Advisory""
So, if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, ""Tool Time,"" you'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch ""X-Files""

Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals

Do it again now

You're my butterfly, sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

Come my lady, come-come my lady

Come my lady, you're my pretty baby

Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, me and you's like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

The nookie (Come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your…
I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)
The nookie (Come on!)
So you can take that cookie

Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your…

[Verse 3]
Why did it take so long?
Why, did I wait so long, huh?
To figure it out, but I did it
And I'm the only one underneath the sun who didn't get it
I can't believe that I could be deceived (But you were!)
By my so-called girl, but in reality
Had a hidden agenda
She put my tender heart in a blender, and still, I surrendered

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) I'm like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump
(Hey!) Like a chump

I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)
The nookie (Come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your…
I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)
The nookie (Come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your…

[Bridge]
I'm only human
It's so easy for your friends to give you their advice
They'll tell you, ""Just let it go!""
It's easier said than done
I appreciate it, I do, but
Just leave me alone, leave me alone
Just leave me alone
And nothing gonna change, you can go away
I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
And nothing gonna change, so you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same
And nothing gonna change, so you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here and always be the same

[Chorus]
I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)
The nookie (Come on!)
So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your…
I did it all for the nookie (Come on!)

So you can take that cookie
And stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your (Yeah!)
Stick it up your…

799,Californication,Californication (Deluxe Edition),Red Hot Chili Peppers,1999-06-08,329733,80,"

[Verse 1]
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

[Verse 2]
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

[Bridge]
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?

[Pre-Chorus]
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

[Verse 3]
Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

[Verse 4]
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

[Bridge]
Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean no vacation

[Pre-Chorus]
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

[Bridge]
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving

[Pre-Chorus]
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

(It goes a little somethin' like, like, like this)

[Verse 1]
In my shoes my toes are busted
My kitchen says my bread is molded
I got a good job at the dollar store
One foot in the hole
One foot getting deeper
With a broken mirror and a blown-out speaker
I ain't got much else to lose

I'm faded
Flat busted
Been jaded
I've been dusted
I know that I've seen better days

One foot in the hole
One foot getting deeper
Crank it to eleven
Blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose

[Chorus] x2
Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out

I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
And the bottom drops out

[Verse 2]
Now, my cup's filled up with five-buck wine
I find myself here all the time
Another rip in the glass
Another chip in my tooth

Rained on
I've been stained on
Found another goat I try to put the blame on
And now I'm stepping on all the cracks
So I guess there ain't no use

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm bent like glass
Second hand like glory
Missed the bus
But I'm in no hurry
Molasses fast
No business born

One foot in the hole
One foot getting deeper
Crank it to eleven
Blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I know that I've seen better days
(And the bottom drops out)
I've been the star of so many plays
(And the bottom drops out)

I walked on the edge without a hold whole way
(And the bottom drops out)
Cause I know, I know that I've seen better, better days
(And the bottom drops out)

(Now I'm real thirsty)

With you is where I belong, belong

I gotta get away from a love
That kills me everyday
I'd gladly say to you
