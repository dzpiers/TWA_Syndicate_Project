[Verse 1]
Little supernovas in my head
Little soft pulses in my dead
Little souvenirs and secrets shared
A little off-guard and unprepared
I was never good enough to find
I was never bad enough to mind
In the middle, I will do my best
Take me in your arms and leave the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you anything to...

[Chorus 1]
Say you wanna stay—you want me, too
Say you'll never die—you'll always haunt me
I want to know that I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me

[Post-Chorus]
Together—together—we'll be together
Together—forever...

[Verse 2]
Little variations on my page
Little doors open on my cage
Little time has come and gone so far
Little by little, who you are
I can see the patterns on your face
I can see the miracles I trace
Symmetry and shadows, I can't hide
I just want to be right by your side

[Pre-Chorus]
I will give you everything to...

[Chorus 2]
Say you wanna stay—you want me, too
Say you'll never die—you'll always haunt me
I want to know that I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me
Say you wanna stay—you want me, too
Say you'll never die—you'll always haunt me
I want to know that I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me

[Post-Chorus]
Together—together—we'll be together
Together—forever—I belong to you
Together—we'll be together
Together—forever—I belong to you

[Bridge]
Little supernovas in my head
Little soft pulses in my dead
Little souvenirs and secrets shared
A little off-guard and unprepared

I will give you anything to—
I will give you everything to...

Say you wanna stay—you want me, too
Say you'll never die—you'll always haunt me
I want to know that I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me
Say you wanna stay—you want me, too
Say you'll never die—you'll always haunt me
I want to know that I belong to you
Say you'll haunt me

[Post-Chorus/Outro]
Together—together—we'll be together
Together—forever—I belong to you
Together—we'll be together
Together—forever—I belong to you

[Verse 1]
We're only young and naive still
We require certain skills
The mood it changes like the wind
Hard to control when it begins

[Chorus]
The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Can't help myself but count the flaws
Claw my way out through these walls
One temporary escape
Feel it start to permeate

We lie beneath the stars at night
Our hands gripping each other tight
You keep my secrets hope to die
Promises, swear them to the sky

[Chorus]
The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Thom Powers]
As it withers, brittle it shakes
Can you whisper, as it crumbles and breaks?
As you shiver, count up all your mistakes
Pair of forgivers, let go before it's too late
Can you whisper? Can you whisper?
Can you whisper? Can you whisper?

[Chorus]
The bittersweet between my teeth
Trying to find the in-betweens
Fall back in love eventually
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I did not know you were a fake
Every lie straight to my face

Hey kid (Hey kid)
Do I have your attention?
I know the way you've been living
Life so reckless, tragedy endless
Welcome to the family
Hey, there's something missing
Only time will alter your vision
Never in question, lethal injection
Welcome to the family

Not long ago you'd find the answers were so crystal clear
Within a day you find yourself living in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now?

When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside

Hey (Hey kid)
I have to question
What's with the violent aggression?
Details blurry, lost him too early
Welcome to the family
Hey, why won't you listen?
Can't help the people you're missing
It's been done, a casualty re-run
Welcome to the family

I try and help you with the things that can't be justified
I need to warn you that there is no way to rationalize
So have you figured it out now?

Psychotic rabid dementia

Cast out in a world you've never known
Stand down, place your weapons by your side
It's our war, in the end we'll surely lose but that's alright

So have you figured it out now?
So have you figured it out?

Am I going insane?
My blood is boiling inside of my veins
An evil feeling attacks (attacks)
My body's shaking, there's no turning back
Don't take your eyes off the trigger!

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yo
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady, something empty's within them
We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington]
Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yeah
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

[Outro: (Chester Bennington) Mike Shinoda]
(All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got)

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision
(I'm holding on to what I haven't got)
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them
We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there

Until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear

And I know you hear their voices (Calling from above)
And I know they may seem real (These signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices (Some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul, and it's ours now to steal
As your nightmare comes to life

[Chorus]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare

[Verse 1]
We live in a cold dark world with venom in it's fangs
You can spit it in my face but I know I'll be okay
It's on the attack, it's a war, it's a game
A ball and chain, chew my arm off to get away
Don't fight it
Or deny it
Invite it

[Chorus]
'Cause when it feels like a kick in the teeth, I can take it
Throw your stones and you won't see me break it
Say what you want, take your shots
You're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth
Na na na na na na
Kick in the teeth
Na na na na na na

[Verse 2]
I gotta say thanks cause you kick me when I'm down
I'm bleeding out the mouth
I hope you know I'm stronger now
I'm taking the hate, I am turning it all around
I won't go down till I'm six feet underground
Don't fight it
Or deny it
Invite it

'Cause when it feels like a kick in the teeth, I can take it
Throw your stones and you won't see me break it
Say what you want, take your shots
You're setting me free with one more kick in the teeth

What doesn’t kill me only, will make me stronger in my head

[Intro]
Stay for tonight if you want to
I can show you what my dreams are made of
As I'm dreamin' of your face
I've been away for a long time
Such a long time, and I miss you there
I can't imagine bein' anywhere else
I can't imagine bein' anywhere else but here
(Oh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
How the hell did you ever pick me?
Honestly, I could sing you a song
But I don't think words can express your beauty
It's singing to me
How the hell did we end up like this?
You bring out the beast in me
I fell in love from the moment we kissed
Since then, we've been history

[Chorus]
They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need (It's all that I need)
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave (I will never leave)
Please stay forever with me

[Verse 2]
It goes to show, I hope that you know that you are
What my dreams are made of
Can't fall asleep, can't fall asleep
I lie in my bed awake, in my bed awake at night
As I dream of you
I'll fall in love, you'll fall in love
It could mean everything, everything to me
I can't imagine bein' anywhere else

They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need (It's all that I need)
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken

Please stay forever with me

The way that we are is the reason I stay
As long as you're here with me, I know I'll be okay
The way that we are is the reason I stay
As long as you're here with me, I know I'll be okay

[Chorus]
They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need (It's all that I need)
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave (I will never leave)
Please stay forever with me
(I couldn't love just anyone) They say that love is forever
(I was created to love just one, baby) Your forever is all that I need
(I couldn't love just anyone)
(I was created to love just one girl) Please stay as long as you need
(I couldn't love just anyone) Can't promise that things won't be broken

16 dollars in a back street corner is enough for a beautiful day
I see a window open hearing Aerosmith rocking with Dick Brave ""Walk This Way""
I need a quick drink, more volume for the beat
I see the cats are playing dice

It's 7 in the morning and you lost all your money
To a fat lady singing ""Boogie Woogie Chili Honey""

[Chorus]
I've been walking the streets again
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again
(Whoa-oh-a-oh)
Just to see what the day will bring
But it's the same old song I'll do it again

I'll bring you home my baby I will
I would love to bring you home (x3)

When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down
Insides crying: ""Save me now""

As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace
Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known

I don't know where us or this start
All of this is tearing us apart

We throw them in the middle
They can pick sides

As the plans turn into compromise
The promises all turn to lies
The spite builds up and I can't get through
Passive me, aggressive you
I know I nag, I moan I know
But with a plan like this it's way too slow
In the time it took to get this bad
I could've made this work but all I had
Was the hope that pieces would take shape
And we could watch them all fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place

Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army
No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?
We've got the right to live, fight to use it
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
I want what's better for you
So long, my friend and adversary
But I'll wait for you

Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
Are you okay?
I've been all around this town
Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years

I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?

And they sacrifice their lives
And they lied about those odds
They'll say it a million times, and they'll say it again

Banging down your door
Get up in the morning yelling, ""No more!""

Lately, I've been seeing things
Belly button piercings
In the sky at night
When we're side by side
And I don't mean to rain
On anybody's cabriolet
One of those games you're gonna lose
But you wanna play it, just in case

[Chorus]
Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

[Verse 2]
Does it help you stay up late?
Does it help you concentrate?
Does it tune you in when you chew your chin?
Am I ruining your fun?
And you talk the talk alright
But do you walk the walk or catch the train?
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now

Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar

I'll never let you down, boy, I'll never let you go
Her subtle hint of life is so innocent and scary
""So, tell me that you're here, boy,"" she says as if she knows
When God took her with time, God made me quite alone
It's like the universe has left me without a place to go
Without a hint of light to watch the movement glow
When our song was slowly starting, your memory felt so real
At first, against my will, but God invented chills

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine, my wounds would start to heal

The kids are in a hurry, and I'm just full of fear
The lights make bodies blurry, it's getting hard enough to hear
It's like the evidence is cared for and evidently clear
If I never leave this dance floor, then I'll never leave you here

Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine, my wounds would start to heal

I'm sick of complaining
About a beautiful life

And how do we stay here?
Do we embrace all the things tonight?

I feel so alive tonight
You got me feeling sublime
I want to yell it from the rooftop down
Until it's over and we're older

For my entertainment
You tell a whimsical lie
To keep me complacent
You knock me down with a smile

How did we get here?
How do we pretend everything's alright?
And how do we stay here?
Do we erase all the fear inside?

I feel so alive tonight
You got me feeling sublime
I want to yell it from the rooftop down
Until it's over and we're older

These worlds are gonna collide
I want to yell it from the rooftops down
Until it's over and we're older

But go slow
Let me hide somewhere I know
And let this
Seed grow
Until we finally call this home

So take me

Let me hide somewhere I know
And let this

Would it tear you apart?
Would you yell it from the rooftops down?
Until it's over and you're older

I feel so alive tonight
You've got me feeling sublime
I want to yell it from the rooftop down
Until it's over and we're older

Like sugar and cyanide
Our worlds are meant to collide
I'm gonna yell it from the rooftops down

[Verse 1]
You are the hole in my head
You are the space in my bed
You are the silence in between
What I thought and what I said
You are the night-time fear
You are the morning when it's clear
When it's over, you're the start
You're my head and you're my heart

[Chorus]
No light, no light
In your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
Tell me what you want me to say

[Verse 2]
Through the crowd I was crying out and
In your place there were a thousand other faces
I was disappearing in plain sight
Heaven help me, I need to make it right

[Pre-Chorus]
You want a revelation
You want to get right
But it's a conversation
I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation
Some kind of resolution
You want a revelation

No light, no light
In your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
Tell me what you want me to say

[Bridge]
Would you leave me
If I told you what I've done?
And would you leave me
If I told you what I've become?
Because it's so easy
To say it to a crowd
But it's so hard, my love
To say it to you out loud

[Chorus]
No light, no light
In your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
Tell me what you want me to say

Sometimes life, it takes you by the hair
Pulls you down before you know it
It's gone and you're dead again
I've been in places and I won't pretend
That I'd make it out just to fall on my head
Wake up strange and take the walk downstairs
Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
You know that I could not believe my own truth
Just show 'em what I choose, got nothing to lose, oh

To not get out of bed, you're lost in your head again
You play the game but you kind of cut
'Cause you're coming down hard, your joints are all stuck

You were pacing, I was insecure
Slip and fall, I'm dodging calls, hug the prison I've been living in

Still believes their heart
And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when
The pain begins to start

And all these demons, they keep me up all night

Endless holiday
Everyone raises kids in a world that changes
Life to a bitter game

Celebrate the day
And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we
Die alone some day

Can nobody save us? Will anyone try?
The bayou is burning, the cypress has died

I am the prodigal son, a shameful prodigy too
I am the love of your life, battering ram and confused

There is desire to fight, but I have nothing to prove
But with the crowd and some lights, I start to feel things move
Do you have something to hide? 'Cause I think that we all do
I am a child inside, back up and give me some room!

We'll have the time of our lives, although we're dying inside

So let me go, go, so let me go, go
Just let me go, go, I'd rather go it alone
So let me go, go, so let me go, go
Just let me go, go, I'm never coming home

[Intro]
Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Verse 1]
And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-whoa

[Verse 2]
And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa (Shake him off)

[Bridge]
And it's hard to dance
With a devil on your back (Shake him off)
And given half the chance
Would I take any of it back? (Shake him off)
It's a fine romance
But it's left me so undone (Shake him off)
(Shake him off) It's always darkest before the dawn
Oh whoa
Oh whoa

[Breakdown]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me (Oh woah)
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me (Oh woah)
But, what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

Each time that I close my eyes, I can feel you
I run away with my imagination
And I am blinded by your light, you fill up the room

This fire grows higher
This fire grows higher
This fire grows higher
This fire grows higher

When there's a burning in your heart
An endless yearning in your heart
Build it bigger than the sun
Let it grow, let it grow
When there's a burning in your heart
Don't be alarmed

This fire grows higher

[Verse 2]
When there's a doubt within your mind
Because you're thinking all the time
Framing rights into wrongs
Move along, move along
When there's a doubt within your mind

When there's a burning in your heart
And you think it'll burst apart
Or there's nothing to fear
Save the tears, save the tears
When there's a burning in your heart

[Bridge]
And if you feel just like a tourist in the city you were born
Then it's time to go
And define your destination
There's so many different places to call home
Because when you find yourself the villain in the story you have written
It's plain to see
That sometimes the best intentions are in need of redemptions
Would you agree?
If so please show me

Love in my eyes, blinded by you
Just to get a taste of heaven

But I can't stand the pain inflicted
In the morning, you're not holding
Onto me

What you're giving me is nothing but a heartless lullaby
Gonna kill my dreams, oh

If you keep messing with my head
Before I slip under your sheets
Can you give me something please?
I can't keep touching you like this
If it's just temporary bliss

We were on fire, now we're frozen
There's no desire, nothing spoken
You're just playing, I keep waiting for your heart

To show our love in a good light
Give me reason, I am pleading

[Verse 1]

Once upon a time I could take anything, anything
Always stepped in time, regardless of the beat
I moved my feet, I carried weight
What I could not do I faked
I dug, seeking treasure
Just to wake up in an early grave
So I stopped right there and said...

[Hook]

Go on alone because I won't follow
This isn't giving up, no, this is letting go
Out with the old dreams I've borrowed
The path I carve from here on out will be my own
The path will be my own

[Verse 2]

This is the part where the needle skips
And the chorus plays like a sink that drips
A syllable repeating like a warning we aren't heeding
Until all of the sudden we notice it
When the wheels brace and the tires grip
A map we've been misreading, a defeat we're not conceding
Until now
There must be some other way out

[Hook]

The wind died, the whole world ceased to move
Now so quiet, her beating heart became a boom
We locked eyes for just a moment or two
She asked why, I said ""I don't know why, I just know.""

[Hook]

Go on alone, cause I won't follow
This isn't giving up, no this is letting go
I made most of all this sorrow
I tried to brave this discontent, but now I'm through
I'm letting go of you

This is letting go
This is letting go

Once upon a time I could take anything, anything

So I gave her everything
She turned out to be a cheat
Said she'd been thinking for a long time
And she found somebody new

Girl, I never thought you'd stay, that's okay
I hope he takes your filthy heart and then he throws you away someday
Before you go, there's one thing you oughta know

She said we've grown apart for sometime

I met a girl at twenty-three
Knew she meant the world to me
So I gave her everything

Asphalt to me has never looked so soft
I bet my mama found my letter, now she's calling the cops
I gotta take this opportunity before I miss it
'Cause now I hear the sirens, and they're off in the distance
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is

Or what happened to the father who swore he'd stay
I didn't know, 'cause you didn't say
Now mama feels guilt, yeah, mama feels pain
When you were young, you never thought you'd die
Found that you could, but too scared to try

Your secrets keep you sick, your lies keep you alive
Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice

The kind of dark that haunts a hundred-year-old house

You tried to save me, it won't work this time 'cause now

Trying to consume, the drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery, can't you see?

On our infected hearts
Maybe it's time for a change

[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

It's like we just can't help ourselves
Cause we don't know how to back down

We were called out to the towns
How the heavens they opened up
Like arms of dazzling gold
With our rain-washed histories
Well, we do not need to be told

Show me now, show me the arms aloft
Every eye, trained on a different star
This magic, this drunken semaphore, and I

This is your life, this your time
We are listening and were not blind
This is your life, this is your time

By a choir of beautiful cheats
And as the kids took back the parks
You and I were left with the streets

This magic, this drunken semaphore, and I

This fear has me chilled
Down to the bone
And I have been haunted by
These things I still have left to say

I'm weary of fighting this alone
So tired of holding on to
Strings much better left to fray

[Chorus]
And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down and this
Seems so complicated
When all I want is just the truth

I'm wilted and faded after all
Too strung out and burnt out to be
Half the man that I could be

I'll never belong inside your world
So black out the sun and leave me
To play out the same old tragedy

[Chorus]
And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me out and this
Seems too complicated
When all I want is just the truth
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down and this
Seems too complicated
When all I want is just the truth

You're my savior after all
Use your flame to guide me home
And then lay your hand on me

And I said
Hear me now here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down and this

Hear me now here and now I'm calling

You won't know your worth now, son, until you take a hit
And you won't find the beat until you lose yourself in it

[Chorus]
That's why we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny

But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American Dream
So shine your light on me

You can't fill your cup until you empty all it has
You can't understand what lays ahead if you don't understand the past
You'll never learn to fly until you're standing at the cliff
You can't truly love until you've given up on it

She told me she that she'd never face the world again
So I offered up a plan:

We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off in the night
We'll come clean and start over
The rest of our lives
When we're gone, we'll stay gone
Out of sight, out of mind

We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off in the night (we have the rest of our lives)
We'll come clean and start over

So shine your light on me (shine your light on me)
No we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah, because these are the things that we can't deny (shine your light on me)

Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or darling, have you started feeling old yet?

But you're always busy being make-believe

And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
When I'm not being honest
I pretend that you were just some lover

I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide

And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute, it gets easier

[Verse 1]
Are there no fighters left here anymore?
Are we the generation we've been waiting for?
Or are we patiently burning, waiting to be saved?

Our heroes, our icons, have mellowed with age
Following rules that they once disobeyed
They're now being led when they used to lead the way

[Hook]
Do you still believe in all the things that you stood by before?
Are you out there on the front lines or at home keeping score?
Do you care to be the layer of the bricks that seal your fate?
Or would you rather be the architect of what we might create?

[Verse 2]
They laid out the blueprints, they poured down a base
Concrete solutions to slow our decay
And when they are gone who the fuck's gonna take their place?
Yeah, will it be the cynics, the critics galore?
The cliché, apathetic, passed out on the floor
The trusty complicit who collectively ignore

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Don't you remember when you were young?
And you wanted to set the whole world on fire
Somewhere deep down, I know you do
And don't you remember when we were young?
How we wanted to set the world on fire
Because I still am and I still do

Make no mistake, we are not afraid
To bear the burden of repeating of what we're thinking anyway
Let's raise the stakes on the bet we made
Let's decide to be the architects, the masters of our fate

[Hook/Outro]

Yeah we still believe in all the things that we stood by before
And after everything we've seen, there may be even more
I know we're not the only ones and we were not the first
And unapologetically we stand behind each word

Time it took us
To where the water was
That’s what the water gave me
And time goes quicker
Between the two of us
But oh, my love, don’t forsake me
Take what the water gave me

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

And oh, poor Atlas
The world’s a beast of a burden
You’ve been holding on a long time
And all this longing
And the ships are left to rust
That’s what the water gave us

So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

Because they took your loved ones
But returned them in exchange for you
But would you have it any other way?
Would you have it any other way?
You couldn't have it any other way

And a bargain must be made
But oh, my love, don’t forget me

Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow

So lay me down

Someone to let me know I could lose it all

Well, I began to break down, searching overtime
Bring me a pig’s heart and a glass of wine

There was nothing that you should’ve said

It was all too soon

But is it me? Is it you?
Is it the times that we’re going through?

They hit me and I’m falling down again

To deserts under burning suns

To fill the pockets of the weak
An artificial enemy, are we so easily deceived?

They carry on

How many more sent to their graves?
In this lesson ignored
I fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve?
What purpose did I serve?

138,Dirty Paws,My Head Is An Animal,Of Monsters and Men,2012-01-01,278373,69,"

[Verse 1]
Jumping up and down the floor
My head, is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn

The son was an okay guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
But it came back with a story to say

[Verse 2]
Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees

The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

[Refrain]
La la la
La la la, la
La la la
La la la, la

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
So for a while, things were cold
They were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines

But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws

[Refrain]
La la la
La la la, la
La la la
La la la, la

[Verse 1]
The bloody angle, the symmetry
Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
My mouth is a gun I can shoot—I can show you the truth
And I don't need a reason to lie to you
No pun intended, no punishment
If I offended you, you needed it
Ideas are the bombs in your mind—a fissure in time
If you don't have a weapon, you can't have mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life... it feels like a prison

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero

[Verse 2]
The catatonic, the sacrilege
Your prima donnas are a privilege
My god has a need to react—it's as simple as that
It's better just to settle than face the facts

[Pre-Chorus]
I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life... it feels like a prison

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero

[Bridge]
One thing that I can't stand
Is when the minutes fight the second hand
I'll waste a lifetime's worth
Just to cling to one more day

[Verse 3]
No fucking quarter, no premiums
The world is stuck in delirium
Man is a four-letter word—it's really absurd
The hate isn't fake; it's just inferred

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
I'm down to absolute zero
Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world
Oh, I'm not afraid
And I will let you down as I hold you in
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the devil, but I won't be your hero

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin

Past the black where the sirens sing

[Verse 1]
I’m just the boy inside the man
Not exactly who you think I am
Trying to trace my steps back here again so many times
I’m just a speck inside your hand
You came and made me who I am
I remember where it all began so clearly

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a million miles away
Still you connect me in your way
And you create in me
Something I would’ve never seen
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
After all the lights go down
I’m just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry
How you’ve become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night
Your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You’re the only one who knows who I really am

[Chorus]
We all wanna be somebody
We just need a taste of who we are
We all wanna be somebody
We’re willing to go but not that far

[Verse 2]
And we’re all see through, just like glass
And we can shatter just as fast
That light’s been burned out for a while
I still see it every time I pass
It was lost in the corners of my mind
Behind a box of reasons why
I never doubted it was there
It just took a little time to find and even when

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a million miles away
Still you connect me in your way
And you create in me something
I would’ve never seen
When I could only see the floor
You made my window a door
So when they say they don’t believe
I hope that they see you in me
After all the lights go down
I’m just the words you are the sound
A strange type of chemistry
How you’ve become a part of me
And when I sit alone at night
Your thoughts burn through me like a fire
You’re the only one who knows who I really am

Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost

I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who, I, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm, mmm

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)

Washed my hands of that for this?

Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home

Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go

Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me

For the best you didn't listen

I need to get my story straight

My friends are in the bathroom

Getting higher than the empire state

My lover she is waiting for me

Just across the bar

My seat's been taken by some sunglasses

Asking 'bout a scar

And I know I gave it to you months ago

I know you're trying to forget

But between the drinks and subtle things

The holes in my apologies

You know I'm trying hard to take it back

So if by the time the bar closes

And you feel like falling down

I'll carry you home

Tonight

We are young

So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

Tonight

We are young

So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

Now I know that I'm not

All that you got

I guess that I

I just thought maybe we could find a ways to fall apart

But our friends are back

So let's raise a toast

Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight

We are young

So let's the set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

We are young

So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

Carry me home tonight

Just carry me home tonight

Carry me home tonight

Just carry me home tonight

The moon is on my side

I have no reason to run

So will someone come and carry me home tonight

The angels never arrived

But I can hear the choir

So will someone come and carry me home

Tonight

We are young

So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

Tonight

We are young

So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes

And you feel like falling down

I'll carry you home tonight

Don't let me get in your way
I miss the lies and the pain
The fights that keep us awake-ake-ake
I'm tellin' you

[Refrain]
I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all

And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery

I've tried but I just can't take it

'Cause the right thing is to give you up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm overcome by shame
'Cause I can never change
And you can never understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)

[Chorus]
Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows-

Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows me
(Save yourself, save yourself)

[Bridge]
You'll never understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)
'Cause I don't understand my sickness
(I'll never understand my sickness)

[Chorus]
Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows-

Save yourself, from a life full of lies
And a heart full of pain and sorrow
Save yourself, from the choices I make
'Cause nothing but failure follows me

I heard them calling in the distance
So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I have caused with my two hands

Alone we traveled armed with nothing but a shadow
We fled far away

Hold your horses now

Through the woods, we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran

Some had scars and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing like the rest

Hold your horses now

Through the woods, we ran

Voices won't go away

Ways to make you fade away

And we're just here alone
I better find you first
Before you find the phone

You gave up? I'll check and see
No one cares less than me

It's over, you can't breathe
Just sleep now, rest in peace

I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you

[Verse 1]
When the day has come
That I’ve lost my way around
And the seasons stop
And hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns grey
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in

I’m bleeding out for you, for you

[Verse 2]
When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

You tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

You heard my voice
I came out of the woods by choice
Shelter also gave their shade
But in the dark I have no name

So leave that click in my head
And I will remember the words that you said
Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I was sure we could see a new start

So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road

But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer

I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine

So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old

So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire

164,Lion,Notes From The Underground,Hollywood Undead,2012-01-01,234933,60,"

[Chorus: Danny]
I am a lion, and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be
How can I sleep at night? There's a war inside my head
I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed
'Cause I am a lion, and you are dead

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
Here's a story of everything we'll ever be
You can hide, but some of us can never leave
And if you go, I don't need those little things
They remind me of all our little dreams
Can you hear the words? All I can say
We can watch the world even if they walk away
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today
You were born a lion, and a lion you will stay

[Chorus: Danny]
I am a lion, and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

[Verse 2: Johnny 3 Tears]
Remember an army of all those little kids
Living life like they only get a little bit
It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle, and
I'd rather die, won't watch you giving in
I'm sorry, daughter, but your father's not the same
I can look into your eyes, and I'll swear that I will change
But tomorrow is tomorrow, so forgive me if I stay
You can hide beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain

After all, only so much we can say
Words can lose their meaning once we walk away
Promise that you love me, watch me as I fade
I'll give you all those things that these liars never gave
Put the hands on the clock and the things we cannot change
Tear it all to pieces and take back what I made
If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save
'Cause I am just a lion, and a lion I will stay

[Chorus: Danny]
I am a lion, and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

[Bridge: Johnny 3 Tears]
Hey, I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home
Hey, I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home, hey

[Chorus: Danny]
I am a lion, and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep

[Verse 1]
Well I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

[Verse 2]
So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

Woah
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge 2]
Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

I laid the gods to rest

Lions guarding castle walls
Hail the king of death

Then I lost it all
Dead and broken
My back's against the wall
Cut me open

And who can save me now?

Another jewel upon the crown

[Verse 1]
You were standing with your girlfriends in the street
Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be
I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
I never was a quitter, oblivious to schoolgirl's lies
And when I look back on those neon nights
The leather seats, the passage rite
I feel the heat, I see the light

[Pre-Chorus]
From Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

[Chorus]
Racing shadows in the moonlight
Through the desert on a hot night
For a second there we’d won
Yeah, we were innocent and young

[Verse 2]
Cast out of the night
You got a foolish heart
So you took your place but the fall from grace
Was the hardest part
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
Her soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black
You should have seen your little face, burning for love
Holding on for your life

All that I wanted was a little touch
A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much, no
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time

[Pre-Chorus]
Miss Atomic Bomb
Making out we've got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

Taking chances on a hot night
For a second there we won
We were innocent and young

[Verse 3]
The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
Sweat on my skin
And this love that I've cradled
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
But I'm standing here and you are too late
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate

It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
(It's a proving ground)
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
(and you turn to chance)
Your soul was innocent
She kissed him and she painted it black (on a loser's game)
You should have seen your little face
Burning for love
(Miss Atomic Bomb)

[Outro]
Holding on for your life
But you can't survive (All that I wanted was a little touch)
When you want it all (A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much)
There's another side (Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time)

So all you sick and the bitterness of the lonely
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends
And every step, another step, you're walking on my dreams
And every breath, another breath, you're breathing when I breathe

'Cause stories aren't told about the ones unseen
With a gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky
Crooked smile on his face, he doesn't think he can die
So grab a pick and an ax 'cause we try, we cry
Into the bottle of Jack, we die inside
So when you look in his eyes, what you see now?
Murder the monster you've made and watch him bleed out
We're in a life where it's kill or lose

From under the street, through the gutters of youth
Just cry, motherfucker, yeah, I'm talking to you

[Verse 1]
Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, ""Ain't we all just runaways? We got time""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But that ain't much
We can't wait till tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

[Verse 2]
We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We can't wait til tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose
Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose

[Chorus]
Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

[Verse 3]
We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other till the morning light
We used to laugh, now we only fight
Baby are you lonesome now?

[Verse 4]
At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We can't wait till tomorrow
Oh, we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind (Why you want to hide it?)
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive

[Chorus]
Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you run away
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

[Outro]
Oh! Oh! Oh!

Ain't we all just runaways?
Yeah, runaways

You can leave, now it's your choice

I'm alive in here, so alive in here
Pulling down a little peace
I'm open wide in here, slow to rise in here
Saving grace and killing me
You say this only makes me incomplete
I'm canceled out and rendered obsolete
Tell the mad chameleon he's not welcome anymore
I know what I'm looking for...

Somewhere close, somewhere safe
Somewhere I know—I know I'll never live in chains
The one is now aware
So stay away from me—I'm just too young to care

Comatose with common sense
I take my time in here; somebody get me out of here
What am I so against?
I just want to watch the whole world burn
Lost a million times and I won't learn
Show me someone innocent, I'll show you there's no proof
I may be gone, but I'm no fool...

And I’ll go along with everything you say
But I’ll ride home laughing, look at me now
The walls of my town, they come crumbling down
And my ears hear the call of my unborn sons
And I know their choices color all I’ve done
But I’ll explain it all to the watchman’s son
I never lived a year better spent in love

And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce

I stretch my arms into the sky
I cry Babel! Babel! Look at me now
Then the walls of my town, they come crumbling down
You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl
As all we see will slip into the cloud
So come down from your mountain and stand where we’ve been
You know our breath is weak and our body thin

Press my nose up to the glass around your heart
I should’ve known I was weaker from the start
You’ll build your walls and I will play my bloody part

And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce

I drove through the desert last night
I carried the weight of our last fight
Elvis singing don't be cruel, and I wonder if you feel it too
It's like we're going under
Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line
The question of my heart came to my mind

[Chorus]
If I go on with you (by my side)
Can it be the way it was?
When we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?

[Verse 2]
Maybe a thief stole your heart
Or maybe we just drifted apart
I remember driving in my daddy's car to the airfield
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust
That paradise is buried in the dust

If I go on with you (by my side)
Can it be the way it was?
When we met, did you forget all about those golden nights?

Sometimes a dream don't come true

Can it be the way it was?

Out of feathers, out of bones
We set fire to our homes
Walking barefoot in the snow
Distant rhythm of the drum
As we drifted towards the storm
Baby lion lost his teeth
Now they're swimming in the sea

Troubled spirits on my chest
Where they laid to rest
The birds all left, my tall friend
As your body hit the sand
Million stars up in the sky
Formed a tiger's eye
That looked down on my face
Out of time and out of place

[Verse 1]
All these kind of places
Make it seem like it's been ages
And tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try

Once I was outside Penn Station
Selling red and white carnations
We were still alone
My wife and I
Before we marry, save my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

But off the boat they stayed a while
Then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so
At most I took a walk

[Chorus]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Practice isn't perfect
But the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
And there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse

Once my mother-in-law came
Just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children
Play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments
Now the accounts are overdrawn
I took a walk

Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

Honey, it's your son
I think I borrowed just too much
We had taxes, we had bills
We had a lifestyle to front
And tonight I swear I'll come home
And we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow you'll cook dinner
For the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists
And all their damn taxes
You'll see I am no criminal
I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward
To admit when I'm in need
I took a walk

[Chorus]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine

Stretch out my life
And pick the seams out
Take what you like
But close my ears and eyes
Watch me stumble over and over

I had done wrong
You built your tower
But call me home
And I will build a throne
And wash my eyes out never again

But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light

Skin too tight
And eyes like marbles
You spin me high
So watch me as I glide
Before I tumble homeward, homeward

I know I've tried
I was not stable
Flawed by pride
I miss my sanguine eyes
So hold my hands up -- breathe in, breathe out

And in the middle of the night
I may watch you go

Of the change I'll show

I must've been a fool to the bitter end
Now I hold on to hope that I'll have you back again

I'd bargain and I'd fight
But there's another world you're livin' in tonight

[Chorus]
Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
I don't want your memory in my head, no
I want you here with me

[Bridge]
Well, I saw you in a restaurant the other day
And instead of walkin' towards you, I ran away (ran away)
I keep on waitin' for you
For you to come around
Come around and say

[Chorus]
I don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
Don't need those memories in my head, no
I want you here with me
Ahhhhh
(Here with me)
Ahhhhh

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
You know, the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out the cage, I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

Well all the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (Died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
Through a constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

[Verse 1]
I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Woah, ah

[Verse 2]
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

[Chorus]
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)

[Bridge]
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case, I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, ""You got me, baby
Are you mine?""
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
(Or just mine tonight?)

All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here

Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house

Oh, I cannot explain what's going down

In and out somewhere else right now

Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that babyface

Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall, you were looking out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
Soft speak with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees

Do-do-do, do-do-do

You can drive all night

And now I’m here to give you all of my love (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
So I can watch your face as I take it all away (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus: Patrick with Foxes, Foxes]
If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
(I know I’m bad news)
For just one yesterday
(I saved it all for you)
For just one yesterday

207,Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?,AM,Arctic Monkeys,2013-09-09,161123,81,"

[Verse 1]
The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""High, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

[Verse 2]
Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
""High, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

[Bridge]
And I can't see you here, wonder where I might
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you got to be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""

[Outro]
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're (high)?""

[Verse 1]
I don't mind
Lettin' you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, well just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feedin' on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ah-ah-ah)

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone

Where you're from
You might be the one who's runnin' things
Well you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
You see it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're livin' in a bubble

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you? (Mm-mm-mm-ah-ah-ah)

When nobody wants to fool with you? (Oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah)

'Cause you're on your own (Hey) in the real world (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Intro]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place

[Verse 1]
Make that money, fake that bunny, ache my tummy
On the fence, all the time
Paid junk honey, your face so sunny, ain't that funny?
All my friends always lie to me, I know they're thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me
(Being me, being me)

[Verse 2]
Keep on dreaming, don't stop breathing, fight those demons
Sell your soul, not your whole self
Oh, if they see it when you're sleeping, make them leave it
And I can't even see if it’s out there, anymore
So

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me
(Being me, being me)

[Bridge]
Being me can only mean feeling scared to breathe
If you leave me, then I'll be afraid of everything
That makes me anxious, gives me patience
Calms me down, lets me face this, let me sleep
And when I wake up, let me be

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me

Many days fell away with nothing to show

Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

I'm here to collect your hearts
It's the only reason that I sing
I don't believe a word you say
But I can't stop listening
This is the story of how they met
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes
And when she touched him he turned ruby red
A story that they'll never forget, never forget

Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do

[Verse 1]
We talked about making it
I'm sorry that you never made it
And it pains me just to hear you have to say it
You knew the game and played it
It kills to know that you have been defeated
I see the wires pulling while you're breathing
You knew you had a reason
It killed you like diseases
And I can hear it in your voice while you're speaking
You can't be treated
Mr. Know-it-all had his reign and his fall
At least that's what his brain is telling all

[Chorus]
If he said ""help me kill the president""
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming ""let us in""
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh

[Verse 2]
He told me I should take it in, listen to every word he's speaking
The wires getting older, I can hear the way they're creaking
As they're holding him, well, I could see it in his jaw
That all he ever wanted was a job
He tells me to be raw
Admits to every little flaw
That never let him sit upon the top
Won't tell me to stop
Thinks that I should be a little cautious
Well, I can tell the wires pulled

[Chorus]
If he said ""help me kill the president""
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming ""let us in""
The wires got the best of him
All that he invested in goes
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh
Straight to hell, straight to hell
Woah-oh-oh-ohh-oh

I'm having trouble in believing
And I just started seeing
Light at the beginning of the tunnel
But he tells me that I'm dreaming
When he talks I hear his ghosts
Every word they say to me
I just pray the wires aren't coming

[Chorus]
If he said ""help me kill the president""
I'd say he needs medicine
Sick of screaming ""let us in""
The wires got the best of him

I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more ""shotty""
I bet a lot of me was lost, ""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not any more, flesh out the door, SWAT!
I must've forgot, you can't trust me
I'm open a moment and closed when you show it
Before you know it, I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds
You should take my life, you should take my soul

You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
And I'll be holding on to you
And I'll be holding on to you

[Verse 2]
Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine
And tie it to a tree tell it, ""You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me!""

(Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh)
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night

I'm never gonna look back, whoa
I'm never gonna give it up, no

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
(Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh)
But all the possibilities
No limits, just epiphanies
(Wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oh)

I'm never gonna look back, whoa
I'm never gonna give it up, no

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be the best day of my life

This is gonna be the best day of my life

This is gonna be the best day of my life

Much younger than you are now
And once we started having friends 'round

My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire

I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

To replace that slot with what I once bought

I taste you on my lips and I can't get rid of you
So I say damn your kiss and the awful things you do

[Chorus]
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah

[Bridge]
Just one more hit and then we're through
'Cause you could never love me back
Cut every tie I have to you
'Cause your love's a fucking drag
But I need it so bad
Your love's a fucking drag
But I need it so bad

Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine
Yeah, you're worse than nicotine, nicotine

[Verse 1]
Step out into the Indian dust
I can feel the cracks in my spirit
They're starting to bust
Drive by your house, nobody's home
I'm trying to tell myself that I'm better off alone

[Chorus]
All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl, don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world, she's just another girl
Another girl

[Verse 2]
I went to see a fortuneteller, that was a trip
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip
I can't believe you're out there flying with someone else

[Verse 3]
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
I got an invitation but I didn't reply
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
And give him all of my love

[Chorus]
All of my friends say I should move on
She's just another girl, don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
And all of my friends say it wasn't meant to be
And it's a great big world, she's just another girl

[Bridge]
I could be reeling them in left and right
Something's got a hold on me, tonight
Well maybe all of my friends should confront
The fact that I don't want another girl

[Chorus]
All of my friends say I should move on
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
All of my friends say
She's just another girl

[Outro]
Now why can't I sleep at night
And why don't the moon look right
The sound's off but the TV's on
And it's a great big world

She's just another girl
Don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
She's just another girl
All my friends say she's just another girl
Another girl

[Verse 1]
All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man, I'm sure
When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

[Chorus]
But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody
Like you, oh, oh, oh
Like you, like you

[Verse 2]
So you brought out the best in me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

[Chorus]
But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody

I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go
I'm just a believer, that things will get better
Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

I'm a little bit sheltered

I'm a little bit nervous
I'm going nowhere
I'm a little bit jealous
I'm a little bit slow
I'm a little bit hurtful
And I don't wanna let it go
No, and I don't wanna let it go
I'm a little bit angry, when everyone's around
But I get a little lonely, when no one's out
I feel my demons misleading me

Some can take it or leave it, but I don't wanna let it go

Maybe when I get older
And I'm in the ground
The weights off my shoulders it was bringing me down (down)
I've never been that lucky I've never tasted fame (fame)
I'm always looking for something but I hate changin'
Time fades
There's no space
As life breaks new ground

It doesn't matter what is out there
My head is spinning and it won't bail out
It doesn't matter what is out there

Covering up her face
And oh, what a letdown
I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place

We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking about you
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two

You know I can't be found with you

Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you

What a familiar face
Do you get what I mean now?

[Verse 1]
In a far and distant galaxy
Inside my telescope I see
A pair of eyes peer back at me
He walks and talks and looks like me
He sits around inside his house
From room to room, he moves about
Fills his life with pointless things
And wonders how it all turns out

[Refrain]
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
It's safe to say that

[Chorus]
I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
The walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted
Don't waste it

[Verse 2]
Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sounds
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about

[Refrain]
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
It's safe to say that

[Chorus]
I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
The walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted

[Bridge]
Here in my mind, losing my friends
Fall on my face, do it again
You say, ""How do you do?""
Man, how 'bout you? Man, how 'bout you?
To be free, to be sold
To be killed, to be safe
In my head, I'm alone
I'm not dead, I'm ashamed
Just like you, I've been trying to escape
In my bones, I feel cold
I give thanks to the Lord
Industry, in the street
Let me go, let me be
I don't need to be here
I'm alone, can't you see? Can't you see?

[Chorus]
I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
These walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent or time I've wasted
Don't waste it

Face stained in the ceiling
Why does it keep saying
""I don't have to see you right now""
""I don't have to see you right now""?

Digging like you can bury
Something that cannot die
We could wash the dirt off our hands now
Keep it from living underground

Lazy summer goddess
You can tell our whole empire
""I don't have to see you right now""
""I don't have to see you right now""

""I don't have to see you right now""
""I don't have to see you right now""
""I don't have to see you right now""

[Verse 1]
Baby, you should know by now that I’m right for you
But every time I step to you, you change your tune
Sweet wheel of death keeps us holding our breath
I step to the right, you move to the left
And there's no one else I'd rather die to myself

[Chorus]
Oh why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm starting to unwind
I've been tripping over you
So tell me something new
Take it or leave it

[Verse 2]
Maybe I should pack my things and move on
Maybe I'm fooling myself and you're already gone
Watching the flames wither and fade
Trying to make sense of the look on your face
I'm down on my knees just praying that I can hold on

[Chorus]
Oh why won't you make up your mind?
I think I must confess, I'm learning to unwind
I've been tripping over you
So tell me something new
Take it or leave it

Oh baby, please
Stay with me
Or cut me free
It’s killing me

Peepin' through the floor, it's like they know
It's like they know I'm looking from the outside
And creeping to the door, it's like they know

They gathered up a warrant 'cause they

It must be fate, I found a place for us

Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am
Bring it to an end
Make me fall. Make me bleed
Go ahead and change me!
Take away everything I am
Everything I am!

Never enough
(Who I am is not good enough)
Never enough
(Who I am)

Carnivore! Carnivore!
Won't you come digest me?
Take away everything I am
Bring it to an end
Carnivore! Carnivore!
Could you come and change me?
Take away everything I am
Everything I am!

[Intro: Charlie Scene]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
We come from a world of oblivion, bad dreams
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstring
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things
I'm really not a madman, the voices keep asking
Born with this soul that don't wanna be saved
Every time I look around, I see what a fiend made
Every time I die, I hope they're digging up my grave
An Undead one like the flag that I wave
I'm not afraid to cry from this cocaine sickness
I'm not afraid to die, let the Good Book witness
I ask and give none, nope, no forgiveness
This is Day of the Dead, and you're on our hit list
So come, all you misfits
Bitch, you're on our hit list

[Chorus: Danny]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, holy ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
This is exactly what has to be done, it happened so gradually
It's like I magically happened to be this phantom that candidly
Lets this dagger cut jaggedly while you're gasping so rapidly
While you gag on this rag, I feed you while laughing so happily
It's okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark
I'll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart
And I've already started, there ain't no saving your heart
This is the Day of the Dead, this ain't no day in the park
Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones
The fun has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow
And when I'm done, I ain't done 'cause it's hell that follows
Now get ready for sorrow
'Cause it's hell that follows

[Chorus: Danny]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, holy ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

[Bridge: Danny & Charlie Scene]
When the ashes start to rise and the moon falls from the sky
And a thousand candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry on the flames below the sky
Would a thousand souls still pray for you and I?

[Chorus: Danny]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

[Outro: Charlie Scene & Danny & J-Dog]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Here's to the damned
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Here's to the damned
It's the Day of the Dead

[Intro: Cody Carson]
Ha ha ha ha, this is about you

[Verse 1: Cody Carson]
Beware, beware, be skeptical
Of their smiles, their smiles of plated gold
Deceit so natural
But a wolf in sheep's clothing is more than a warning
Baa baa, black sheep, have you any soul?
No sir, by the way, what the hell are morals?
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jill's a little whore and her alibis are turning tricks

[Chorus: Cody Carson]
So could you
Tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day (one day)
You will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt (take it away)

[Verse 2: William Beckett]
Aware, aware, you stalk your prey
With criminal mentality
You sink your teeth into the people you depend on
Infecting everyone, you're quite the problem
Fee-fi-fo-fum, better run and hide
I smell the blood of a petty little coward
Jack be lethal, Jack be slick
Jill will leave you lonely dying in a filthy ditch

[Chorus: Cody Carson]
So could you
Tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day (one day)
You will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt

[Bridge: Cody Carson]
Maybe you'll change, abandon all your wicked ways
Make amends and start anew again
Maybe you'll see all the wrongs you did to me
And start all over, start all over again

[Spoken: Cody Carson]
Who am I kidding? Now, let's not get overzealous here
You've always been a huge piece of shit
If I could kill you, I would, but it's frowned upon in all fifty states
Having said that, burn in hell!

[Chorus: Cody Carson]
Oh, oh, oh, so tell me how you're sleeping easy
How you're only thinking of yourself
Show me how you justify
Telling all your lies like second nature
Listen, mark my words, one day (one day)
You will pay, you will pay
Karma's gonna come collect your debt

[Outro: Cody Carson]
Karma's gonna come collect your debt (oh, oh, oh)
Karma's gonna come collect your debt
Jazzy!

On pins and needles we are waiting for the fall
We count the days scratching lines on the wall
Wait in the wings, at someone's beck and call

No longer recognize the place that I call home
No longer recognize this face as my own
Somewhere, this fate, I lost control

We backed down
We took no for answers far too long
We felt those walls close around

I don't wanna be here anymore
I don't wanna be here anymore

I don't wanna be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured
See I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn
And I don't wanna be here anymore

On hand and foot we answered every single call
And weathered every day like passing storms
But when we break we will all be gone

Won't back down
Won't take no for answers
Anymore these walls close
We pace back and forth

I don't wanna be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured
See, I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
But something has to die to be reborn
I don't wanna be here anymore

The point where we break
Gets closer everyday
But where do we go?
But where do we go?

I don't wanna be here anymore
I don't wanna be here anymore

I don't wanna be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured
See I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
But something has to die to be reborn
And I don't wanna be here anymore, anymore

To know just where you have been

Are the ones where we fake it
In the roles that we play

Nothing matters when the pain is all but gone
When you are finally awake
Despite the overwhelming odds
Tomorrow came
And when they see you crack a smile
And you decide to stay awhile
You'll be ready then
To laugh again

Nothing matters but the pain
(We are tragedy
Yeah, we are sympathy)
Nothing matters but the pain
You see what you want to see
Nothing matters but the pain

And distant memories)
Nothing matters but the pain
We all learn to laugh again
Yeah, we all learn to laugh again

I can make the good girls bad for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your... name

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the Queen, baby, I'm your King
Find out what you want
Be that guy for a month
But, the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I could make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh my God, who is he? Who is he?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name...

[Bridge]
Girls only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, don't say I didn't warn you
It's torture, it's torture
Don't say I didn't warn you
It's torture, it's torture
Don't say I didn't warn you

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

She took my heart, left me for dead
And drank my blood, told me she said
Our secret's worth, its weight in gold
That fire we had, now is turning cold

Fired out like a cannonball
But I waited too long
Yeah I waited too long
Got high from a holy vein
Crashed down in a hurricane
Love has been here and gone

Where did you go? Where did you run?
I can't erase what you've done
Let's burn the past, forget the truth

Going under again, so don't follow me

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Tell us all again what you think we should be
What the answers are, what it is we can't see
Tell us all again how to do what you say
How to fall in line, how there's no other way
But oh, we all know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Show us all again, that our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared, that you have what we need
Show us all again 'cause we cannot be saved
'Cause the end is near, now there's no other way
And oh, you will know

[Verse 3: Rakim]
Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
They say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain drained, manipulated like artists
It's real deep until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock
Till pop and radio and record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game, to me you're all the same
You're guilty

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame

Awoke
When the light
Hit me right in the temple
Felt something cold
Touch my toes as it passed

Might not be
The face you'd expect
But he's clearly insane
Got me pegged in the back

Just need a
Bit of luck
Get 'em up, point the gun
At the eyes
Or
At the knees, had to shoot
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Bit of luck
Get 'em up
Made to run for our lives
Take out the knees
Had to choose
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Eyes
Huge
So little left if something
Cracks and clues
He's crazy as a straw
Why... Denied... Does no one care or nothing
How, they ask, I ever last so long

Cause I, I went blind
A blinding riot
He's regretting every word

Those empty lies
One more tonight
My blinding riot
As I summon every nerve

Just need a
Bit of luck
Get 'em up, point the gun
At the eyes
Or
At the knees, had to shoot
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Bit of luck
Get 'em up
Made to run for our lives
Take out the knees
Had to choose
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out the gunman

Gonna take out
Gonna take out
Gonna take out
Gonna take out

Just need a
Bit of luck
Get 'em up, point the gun
At the eyes
Or
At the knees, had to shoot
Had to fight
Gonna take out the gunman

Bit of luck
Get 'em up
Made to run for our lives
I'm so amazed at the way
We televise

Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out the gunman
Gonna take out the gunman

And watch the shell come unraveled
As the seed begins to rise
Embracing a starlit fate as we wait in the night
It's written in the walls

[Chorus]
As we walk in a straight line
Down in the dirt with a landslide approaching
But nothing could ever stop us
From stealing our own place in the sun
We will face the odds against us
And run into the fear we run from (ah, ah)

[Outro]
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)
It has begun (ah, ah)

[Verse 1]
How did it feel when it came alive and took you
Out of the black? It broke your skin and shook through
Every part of me, every part of you

[Chorus]
You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk, 'cause you haven't been spoken to
I've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart bleeding blood from an empty pocket

[Verse 2]
I never knew why and you didn't care when
It closed every door, and washed away no sin
And I promised you like you promised me
But those vows we made fucked it up for free

[Chorus]
You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk, 'cause you haven't been spoken to
I've got a gun for a mouth and a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart bleeding blood from an empty pocket

[Chorus]
You made a fool out of me and took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk, 'cause you haven't been spoken to

Never lets you go
Deals a crooked hand

290,I Wanna Get Better,Strange Desire,Bleachers,2014-07-14,204520,64,"

[Verse 1]
Hey, I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
Calling my name and I follow just to find you
I trace the faith to a broken down television, and put on the weather
And I've trained myself to give up on the past 'cause
I froze in time between hearses and caskets
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
I wanna get better

[Verse 2]
While my friends were getting high and chasing girls down parkway lines
I was losing my mind because the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
That I gave wasted on a nice face
In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

[Chorus]
I didn’t know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

[Verse 3]
I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was
Now I'm a stranger
And I miss the days of a life still permanent
Mourn the years before I got carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
So now I'm staring at the interstate screaming at myself
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

[Chorus]
I didn’t know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til i wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi
I'm screaming from my bedroom window
Even if it's gonna kill me

[Verse 4]
Woke up this morning early before my family
From this dream where she was trying to show me
How a life can move from the darkness
She said to get better
So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
And I crash my car 'cause I wanna get carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I'm standing on the overpass screaming at myself
""Hey, I wanna get better!""

[Chorus]
I didn’t know I was lonely 'til I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken 'til I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better

Somewhere in the end of all this hate
There's a light ahead
That shines into this grave that's in the end of all this pain
In the night ahead there's a light upon this

[Chorus 1]
House on a hill
The living, living still
Their intention is to kill and they will, they will
But the children are doing fine
I think about them all the time
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in the end we're all insane
To think a light ahead can save us from this
Grave that's in the end of all this pain
In the night ahead there's a light up on this

[Chorus 1]
House on a hill
The living, living still
Their intention is to kill and they will, they will
But the children are doing fine
I think about them all the time
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will

[Verse 3]
I am not afraid
I won't burn out in this place
My intention is to fade and I will, I will
In this

[Chorus 2]
House on a hill
The dead are living still
With intentions to kill and they will, they will
Keep your children safe inside
Out of pocket, out of mind
Until they drink the wine and they will, they will, they will

[Verse 1]
My God is better than yours
And the walls of my house are so thick
I hear nothing at all
I followed you out in the storm
But it carried you off
And I burned every picture of yours
Was that not enough?

My gun is bigger than yours
So let's arm the masses
And see what the bastards do then
Walking tall once set us apart
Now we're down on all fours
Do you cry my name in the dark
Like I do yours?

[Chorus]
These storms are getting stronger now
Trusses all bend and sway
Lightning hits, the power goes out in the fray

As the waves crash high
And the shoreline disappears
I will scream to the sky
Hey, people live here

[Verse 2]
My dreams are not unlike yours
They long for the safety
And break like a glass chandelier
But there's laughter and oh, there is love
Just past the edge of our fears
And there's chaos when push comes to shove
But it's music to my ears

[Chorus]
May you be in Heaven before the Devil knows you're dead
May these winds be always at your back

Cause when we're all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
We will look at the ashes
And say, people lived here

[Verse 3]
From the penthouse to the holy martyr
Sea to shining sea
From the coffins full of kindergartners
Is this what you call free?
From the hate that drips from all your crosses
Are your hands so clean?

[Chorus]
And the wildfire and it's spreading far
From sea to shining sea

When we're all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
I will scream to the sky
Yeah, I'll scream to the sky
Yeah, I'll scream to the sky
Hey, people live here

[Verse 1]
I locked myself in a hotel room
Then waited all night for the walls to move
I’ve loved some girls that I barely knew
I’ve made some friends, and I’ve lost some, too
Crashed my car, I was seventeen
My mother in the seat riding next to me
The things I’ve learned from a broken mirror
How a face can change when a heart knows fear

[Pre-Chorus]
For all the things my eyes have seen
The best by far is you

[Chorus]
If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I’d keep you safe, I’d keep you dry
Don’t be afraid, Cecilia, I’m the satellite
And you’re the sky

[Verse 2]
I’ve café-crawled through Amsterdam
Been around the world with a punk rock band
And I’ve seen London, and I’ve played Japan
I’ve been knocked down; I got up again

[Pre-Chorus]
For all the places I have been
I’m no place without you

[Chorus]
If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I’d keep you safe, I’d keep you dry
Don’t be afraid, Cecilia, I’m the satellite
And you’re the sky

[Post-Chorus]
I’m the satellite
And you’re the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
For all the things my hands have held
The best by far is you

What life looks like from up above and down below
I’d keep you safe, I’d keep you dry
Don’t be afraid, Cecilia, I’m the satellite
And you’re the sky

And of all the lift-homes and all the mixed feelings

To go out and catch a death with a dress­ fit for the summer

Give me the flammable life
I'm cold as a match, ready to strike

Here lies a city on fire
Singing along, the arsonist choir
Now here I go
It started with a spark
And burned into the dark
Now, here I go
There is a river I found
Into the wild, under the ground
So here I go
A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now, here I go, well

You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

Come from what's come before

Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

I had to be what never was
Been so hungry I could lie

And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter

Can you believe all they say?
It doesn’t seem like it was only yesterday
When you wandered out on
Superhighway

There should be a law about it
When they can take videos of you
Of you, of you, of you, of you

Feel like I blew my soul out
Across the interwebs and streams
It was a million pieces
Of silver, and I watched them gleam

It left a hole so big inside of me
And I get terrified that
I will never get it back to me
To me, to me, to me, to me

I guess it’s just a modern disease

I get stressed out
And I wanna get high
It’s cuz I’ve seen my face
And I don’t recognize
The person that I feel inside
Inside

Like an American superpower
Turn on the spotlight
And nobody cowers

I don’t want to sell you anything
I don’t want to put myself out
And turn it into a refrain
It’s all just a big advertising campaign

When everybody’s lookin'
It’s supposed to be a dream
But disassociation
I guess it’s just a modern disease

Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again

I'd do it all again

Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor

Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me

It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead

You rode on the back of my bike
I knew from the song that you sang
You were my lover for life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's no time to sleep
Oh, living in a dream

[Chorus]
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimmin' in the sunlight every day
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money

[Verse 2]
So we took to the calico road
Running from the weather (Uh-oh)
There was a highway inside of her eyes
There was a buried treasure
And we got caught in the storm
You started flying a kite
At the end was the key to my heart
You were my lover for life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there's no time to sleep (There's no time to sleep)
Oh, living in a dream

[Chorus]
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimmin' in the sunlight every day
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money

[Bridge]
We carved our love in the mountainside
We soaked our hearts in the rain
And I, waited my whole life, for you

[Chorus]
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimmin' in the sunlight every day
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money

[Intro]
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark
The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

[Verse 1]
Here we are at the end of the road
A road that's quietly caving in
Come too far to pretend that we don't
We don't miss where we started
Looking back, I see a setting sun
And watch my shadow fade into the floor
I am left standing on the edge
Wondering how we got this far, how we got this far

[Chorus]
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, ""What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!"" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

[Post-Chorus]
The kids in the dark
The kids in the dark

[Verse 2]
Here we are at the top of the hill
A hill that's quietly crumbling
Been a while since you dressed for the kill
The kill that sent me tumbling
Looking up, I see a falling star
And watch its fire burn into the floor
And I am left standing on the edge
Wondering why we fall so hard, why we fall so hard

[Chorus]
They left us alone, the kids in the dark
To burn out forever, or light up a spark
We come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark
So let the world sing, ""What a shame! Hey!
What a shame! Hey!"" Beautiful scars on critical veins
Come together, state of the art
We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark, the kids in the dark

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa (The kids in the dark, the kids in the dark)

We'll never surrender, the kids in the dark

Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin'

Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind

I didn't come for a fight but I will fight 'til the end
This one might be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA

Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it, baby, I'm talking no inflation

Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves

Or even exist at all

Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

[Chorus]
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne

[Bridge]
I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know (Know)
I'll leave you choking on every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken and now you know

[Chorus]
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back, leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me, every scar will build my throne

[Verse 1]
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face

I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others' dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe

Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home

Hey, boy, stop pacing 'round the room
Using other people's faces as a mirror for you
I know your lungs need filling
Since your gums have lost their feeling
But don't say that you're giving it up again
""Do you have a card?
My irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself""
It's just a simple diarrhetic that prevents the empathetic
From being just and giving it up

And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind

[Intro]
You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fire

[Chorus]
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

[Verse 1]
I'll be as honest as you'll let me
I miss your early morning company
If you get me
You are my favorite what if
You are my best I'll never know
And I'm starting to forget
Just what summer ever meant to you
What did it ever mean to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night

[Chorus]
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

[Verse 2]
My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
Again and again till I'm stuck in your head
Had my doubts but I let them out
You are the drought
And I'm the holy water you have been without
And all my thoughts of you
They could heat or cool the room
And no, don't tell me you cried
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night

[Chorus]
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

[Bridge]
I wish I'd known how much you loved me
I wish I cared enough to know
I'm sorry every song's about you
The torture of small talk with someone you used to love

[Chorus]
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

And portray we possess something important
And do the things we'd like""

A decline in the standards of what we accept!""

[Verse 1]
Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, ""Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather""
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

[Chorus]
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind?
So goodbye

[Verse 2]
She said, ""It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together""
I said, ""Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever""
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

[Chorus]
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind?

[Outro]
I was doing fine without ya
Till I saw your face, now I can't erase
Giving in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want? Is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya
Till I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
Said, ""Come on, Superman, say your stupid line""
Said, ""Come on, Superman, say your stupid line""
Said, ""Come on, Superman, say your stupid line""

[Verse 1]
Cheated and lied, broken so bad
You made a vow, never get mad
You play the game, though it's unfair
They're all the same, who can compare?
First you lose trust, then you get worried
Night after night, bar after club
Dropping like flies, who woke you up?
On the front lawn, sprinklers turn on
It's not your house, where'd you go wrong?
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

[Chorus]
Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

[Verse 2]
There comes a time, in a short life
Turn it around, get a re-write
Call it a dark night of the soul
Ticking of clocks, gravity's pull
First you get close, then you get worried

[Chorus]
Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

[Bridge]
You're going silent, the silent treatment
It's not inviting now
Don't deny what you meant
You get excited, you get excited
You got a feeling, or at least you can pretend
You wanna light it, you wanna light it
You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends
You get excited, you get excited

[Chorus]
Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first
Flying like a cannonball, falling to the Earth
Heavy as a feather when you hit the dirt
How am I the lucky one?
I do not deserve to wait around forever when you were there first

First you get close, then you get worried
First you get close, then you get worried
(You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends)
First you get close, then you get worried
(You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends)
First you get close, then you get worried
(You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends)
You wanna light it, you wanna light it
You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends
You wanna light it, you wanna light it
You wanna light it now, the candle from both ends

Lost in skies of powdered gold
Caught in clouds of silver ropes
Showered by the empty hopes
As I tumble down, falling fast to the ground

[Pre-Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear
I see it all so clear

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine

[Verse 2: Nanna]
Making waves in pitch black sand
Feel the salt dance on my hands
Raw and charcoal coloured thighs
Feel so cold and my skin feels so paper-thin

[Pre-Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
I know I'll wither so peel away the bark
'Cause nothing grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears, I can see it all so clear
I see it all so clear

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine

But I'm okay in see-through skin
I forgive what is within
Because I'm in this house, I'm in this home
All my time

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, cover your crystal eyes
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine

And I can't get you out of my head

Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
You'll find your way

[Intro: Charlie Scene]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
We come from a world of oblivion, bad dreams
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstring
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things
I'm really not a madman, the voices keep asking
Born with this soul that don't wanna be saved
Every time I look around, I see what a fiend made
Every time I die, I hope they're digging up my grave
An Undead one like the flag that I wave
I'm not afraid to cry from this cocaine sickness
I'm not afraid to die, let the Good Book witness
I ask and give none, nope, no forgiveness
This is Day of the Dead, and you're on our hit list
So come, all you misfits
Bitch, you're on our hit list

[Chorus: Danny]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, holy ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
This is exactly what has to be done, it happened so gradually
It's like I magically happened to be this phantom that candidly
Lets this dagger cut jaggedly while you're gasping so rapidly
While you gag on this rag, I feed you while laughing so happily
It's okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark
I'll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart
And I've already started, there ain't no saving your heart
This is the Day of the Dead, this ain't no day in the park
Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones
The fun has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow
And when I'm done, I ain't done 'cause it's hell that follows
Now get ready for sorrow
'Cause it's hell that follows

[Chorus: Danny]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, holy ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

[Bridge: Danny & Charlie Scene]
When the ashes start to rise and the moon falls from the sky
And a thousand candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry on the flames below the sky
Would a thousand souls still pray for you and I?

[Chorus: Danny]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
So long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

[Outro: Charlie Scene & Danny & J-Dog]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Here's to the damned
It's the Day of the Dead
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Here's to the damned

Shadows fill my mind up
Zeroes tell me my time's up

Maybe my heart's numb
Don't hold my hands accountable

Drive through the timezones
Escape out of my mind's own hold, love

Ramblers in the wilderness we can't find what we need

Get a little worn down in between

Everybody needs someone beside em' shining like a lighthouse from the sea

Bring you home

Face down in the desert now there's a cage locked around my heart
I found a way to drop the keys where my failures were
Now my hands can't reach that far
I ain't made for rivalry I could never take the world alone

But it's your love that brings me home

And need me near
Say it where’d you go

And on those days
When the sky begins to fall
You’re the blood of my blood
We can get through it all

Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone

Never leave you all alone

All the pain and sufferin'
There's beauty in the bleedin'

The highs and lows of livin'

That reduces me to rubble, but looked safe from far away

I don’t know why, I don’t know why I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind, through the ghosts of Beverly Drive
I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I don’t know what I expect to find
Where all the news is secondhand, and everything just goes on as planned

[Bridge]
You wanna teach but not be taught
And I wanna sell but not be bought
So let us not be lonesome
So let us not be lonesome
Lost in between our needs and wants
Our needs and wants

[Chorus]
I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind, through the ghosts of Beverly Drive
I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I don’t know what I expect to find
Where all the news is secondhand, and everything just goes on as planned

Tonight we are victorious
Champagne pouring over us
All my friends were glorious
Tonight we are victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh, victorious
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Double bubble disco queen headed to the guillotine
Skin as cool as Steve McQueen, let me be your killer king
It hurts until it stops, we will love until it's not
I'm a killing spree in white, eyes like broken Christmas lights

[Pre-Chorus]
My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?
Drink the water, drink the wine

Oh we gotta turn up the crazy
Livin' like a washed-up celebrity
Shooting fireworks like it's the Fourth of July
Until we feel alright
Until we feel alright

I'm like a scarf trick, it's all up the sleeve
I taste like magic, waves that swallow quick and deep
Throw the bait, catch the shark, bleed the water red
Fifty words for murder and I'm every one of them

My touch is black and poisonous
And nothing like my punch-drunk kiss
I know you need it, do you feel it?

I wish that you would aim for the blood of my heart, yeah

Your eyes, they could cut through diamonds and steel
For real, they're sharper than the blade in your hand
They tell me you're strong, but they don't tell me what you feel
I feel there's something that you want me to hear
It's coming in loud and clear
You know what you want, what you want, what you want

Fuck the world, my love is real
Fuck the world, this love is real

[Verse 3]
Shit's real, I need you to aim straight for my heart
And if you're gonna miss then hit my head and leave a permanent scar
You're fatal but I love who you are
Be my death or my forever
You're my little bloodfeather

Caffeine, small talk
Wait out the plastic weather
Mmhmm, uh huh, discussing current events
I'll take my time
I'm not the forward thinker
You read my mind
Better to leave it unsaid
Why can't I leave it unsaid?

[Chorus]
You know I talk too much
Honey, come put your lips on mine
And shut me up
We could blame it all on human nature
Stay cool, it's just a kiss
Oh, why you gotta be so talkative?
I talk too much, we talk too much

[Verse 2]
You know my type
Tightrope across the table
Mmhmm, uh huh, I can't keep holding my breath
New wave, no time
Red velvet under pressure
Blah blah, green eyes
I never leave it unsaid
Why can't I leave it unsaid?

You know I talk too much
Honey, come put your lips on mine
And shut me up
We could blame it all on human nature

Silence is golden, and you've got my hopes up
We talk too much
No hesitation, what are we waiting for?

And shut me up (Shut me up)

The girl in the pastry shop with the net in her
Hair is making a cannoli for you to
Take on your hiking trip in the woods with your
Bros that you've known since second grade and you
May encounter dragons or ruffians and be
Called upon to employ your testosterone
In a battle for supremacy and access to
Females glued to the TV
And even if you are victorious you may receive
Many cuts, bruises, and scrapes
And you will require band aids and antiseptic ointments
And tender loving kisses on your stab wounds
And when you come home she will be there
Waiting for you with a fire in her eyes
And a big fat cannoli to shove
In your mouth, and that's why you

I'm so glad I got a girl to think of
Even though she isn't mine
I think about her all the day and all the night
It's enough to know that she's alive
She says I give her sweaty palms, she almost had a heart attack
The truth is that I'm just as scared I don't know how to act
I wish that I could get to know her better, but meeting up
In real life would cause the illusion to shatter
I carved her name into all the trees
Sang a song down on one knee
Looking at the underwear page of the Sears catalog
Like when I was 14
I'm levitating like a magnet turned
The wrong way around
I'm like an Indian Fakir tryna meditate on a
Bed of nails with my pants pulled down

Ground it up in a centrifuge machine
Mixed it with cardamom and cloves
Microwaved it on the popcorn setting
While Adam was like, ""Ooh ooh! That really hurts!""
Going off into the tundra
So pissed at God
And he started lighting minor forest fires, stealing osprey eggs
Messing with the bees who were trying
To pollinate the echinacea, until God said
""I'ma smite you with loneliness
And break your heart in two!""
And Adam wept and wailed
Tearing out his hair
Falling on his knees, looked to
The sky and said, ""Thank God...""

[Intro]
Okay

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling the way that I'm feeling myself
Fuck everyone else
Gotta remember that nobody is better than anyone else, here
(Do you need some time to think it over?)
Look what they do to you
Look what they do to me
Must be joking if you think that either one is free, here

[Chorus 1]
Get up off your knees, girl
Stand face to face with your God
And find out what you are
(Hello, my name is human)
Hello, my name is human
And I came down from the stars
(Hello, my name is human)

[Verse 2]
I'm ready for love, and I'm ready for war
But I'm ready for more
I know that nobody's ever been this fucking ready before, hey
(Do you need some time to think it over?)
So figure it out, or don't figure it out
I figured it out
The bigger the river (the bigger the river)
The bigger the drought (the bigger the drought)

[Chorus 1]
Get up off your knees, boy
Stand face to face with your God
And find out what you are
(Hello, my name is human)
Hello, my name is human
And I came down from the stars
(Hello, my name is human)

[Bridge]
Fire world, I love you
Fireworld

[Chorus 2]
I'm up off my knees, girl
I'm face to face with myself
And I know who I am
(Hello, my name is human)
I stole my power from the sun
I'm more than just a man
(No longer disillusioned)

[Outro]
(I'm not asking questions)
('Cause questions have answers)
(And I don't want answers)
I came down from the stars (so I'll take my chances)
(And what are the chances)
(That I could advance)
(On my own circumstances)
(Said ""what are the chances?"")
Hello, my name is human (And what are the chances?)
(I don't want your answers)
(I'm not asking questions)
(So you keep your answers)
And I know who I am (So you keep your answers)
(I'm not asking questions)
(I'm taking my chances)

Never good just the bad and the ugly
Laid in front of you
Nothing quite like seeing the world
Through the TV's window

Feeling helpless I look for distraction
I go searching for you
Wandering through our city to find some
Solace at your door

I can't stop thinking about it
I can't stop thinking about it
Tell me, did you see the news tonight?

Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get
Now draw me close...

[Verse 2]
So come on, let's forget the emotion
Tie the blinkers on
Hold both hands right over my eyes
Deafen me with music

'Till we're lost in the heat of the moment
And I'm moving in you
Help me keep these hours alive
Help me chase those seconds

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I just keep talking about it
But I'll do nothing about it
Tell me, did you see the news last night?

[Chorus]
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold you can get
Hold me in this wild, wild world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get

Hold me in this wild, wild world

Maybe I don't mind just getting high in mine
We're shouting over music with a friend who's like a brother
Because if I get time, I just regret most shit

[Pre-Chorus]
From every hangover my head feels
To every ex I didn't treat right
To every Monday I called in sick
To every argument I let slide

[Chorus]
Christ, I ain't ever going back to thinking straight
Twice, twice it brought me down but it's the last time

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll grow tired
Of you bitchin' all the time
'Cause when you love the way you’re living
It's just hard to fret about much
Because if I get time, I just regret most shit

From every hangover my head feels
To every ex I didn't treat right
To every Monday I called in sick

Feeling like a hero, but I can't fly
No, you never crash if you don't try
Took it to the edge, now I know why
Never gonna live if you're too scared to die

Staring down the hole inside me
Looking in the mirror
Making peace with the enemy

Open up my heart like a shotgun
Blinded by the light of a new sun
Get up, get up, get out and get done

Get up, get up, stand like a champion
Take it to the world
Gonna sing it like an anthem

[Verse 1]
The boy I love's got another girl
He might be fucking her right now
I don't have an apartment
Thought if I was smart, I'd make it far
But I'm still at the start
Guess I'm contagious, it'd be safest if you ran
Fuck, that's what they all just end up doing in the end
Take my car and paint it black
Take my arm, break it in half
Say something, do it soon
It's too quiet in this room

[Chorus]
I need noise
I need the buzz of a sub
Need the crack of a whip
Need some blood in the cut
I need noise
I need the buzz of a sub
Need the crack of a whip
Need some blood in the cut
I need blood in the cut
I need blood in the cut

[Verse 2]
Met back up with the boy I love
Cried on the streets of San Francisco
I don't have an agenda
All I do is pretend to be okay
So my friends can't see my heart in the blender
And lately, I've been killing all my time
Reading through your messages, my favorite way to die
Take my head and kick it in
Break some bread for all my sins
Say a word, do it soon
It's too quiet in this room

[Chorus]
I need noise
I need the buzz of a sub
Need the crack of a whip
Need some blood in the cut
I need noise
I need the buzz of a sub
Need the crack of a whip
Need some blood in the cut
I need blood in the cut
I need blood in the cut

And so I've arrived
With gold in my eyes
Are you paying attention?

[Chorus]
I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for
I've been looking for so long
In Amerika
Throw my hands in the air

[Verse 1]
Flash faded
Say you care, but you don't
You know I hate it
It's a rich kid game, didn't grow up with a throne
It's all it really is

I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for
Always talking about one day
In Amerika
Same old story, oh
You want glory, son
I've been looking for so long
But you cut me out
Throw my hands in the air 'cause I—

[Verse 2]
Your palace
All the friends you own
So jealous
Felt that rich kid pain, what it is to be alone
It's all it really is

I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?

All the way from Waco to WeHo with a rabbit on her chain
Drove a little slick car to tend bar with the static on her brain
She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame
Little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away

Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

Tex, he was her boyfriend with no kin always running from the law
Every other weekend, the week ends with his back in her claw
He's a livewire, wired, shooting sparks in the night
He’s a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights

Oh, facing where the lines are broken
Oh, name your price to all this living

Big town
Synthetic apparitions of not being lonely
""Look, he's having a breakdown
Oh, what a letdown, a shame, I think he might die""
And now she's dancing enthralling, I guess I gotta wait my turn
I said, ""Don't fall in love with the moment""
She said, ""I've got a lot to learn""

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I'm in love with this city
But the green is turning brown
And I just look pathetic now

If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)
And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)

She's inducing sleep to avoid pain
And I think she's got a gun divinely decreed and custom made
She calls on the phone like the old days, expecting the world
And don't fall in love with the moment
And think you're in love with the girl

There's no more water in this city
But be careful or you'll drown
You think you've got it figured out

If she says I've got to fix my teeth

And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American (She's American)

Well, your face has got a hold on me
But your brain is proper weird
Are you feeling the same?
You just keep nodding at me, looking vacant

Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we’ll never die

Lights down
And we drive and we're drivin' just to get out
Yeah, perfect disasters
Yeah we were swinging, swinging from the rafters

Hey, we were dancing in cars
We were looking for ours
We were naming the stars
After people we knew 'til we had to go
And we were saying things like

You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die

[Bridge]
Nights when we kept dancing
Changing all our plans and
Making every day a holiday
Feel the years start burning
City lights they're turning
Something 'bout this feels the same

[Chorus]
Back when we were kids
Swore we would never die
You and me were kids
Swear that we'll never die
I refuse to look back thinking days were better
Just because they're younger days

Way I feel right now I swear we’ll never change

I called the teacher cause I wanted to confess it now
Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from
I don't take these things so personal, anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible, anymore
Somebody hooted and they hollered can I buy a vowel
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl
I don't think that it's so terrible, anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable, anymore

[Verse 1]
On a fault line, late night
Underneath the stars we came alive
And singing to the sky just felt right
I won't forget the good times
While the punks started picking fights
With the skater kids under city lights
Remember how we laughed 'til we cried
I won't forget the good times

[Chorus]
I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

[Verse 2]
We were bare-knuckled, tight lip
Middle fingers up, ego trip
Devil may care but we didn't mind
I won't forget the good times
We're the boys in black smoking cigarettes
Chasing girls who didn't know love yet
As the bonfire moon came down
I won't forget the good times

[Chorus]
I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

[Bridge]
When we laughed
When we cried
Those were the days
We owned the nights
Locked away
Lost in time
I found the nerve
To say that

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on
I'll hate the goodbye
But I won't forget the good times
I won't forget the good times

I never want to leave this sunset town
But one day the time may come
And I'll take you at your word
And carry on

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son

Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes

[Verse 1]
And we were bold
Over the world
We were flying through the satellites
We had ahold
Of the lightning strikes
When we should have been afraid of heights
And I was trying just to get you
And now I'm dying to forget you
'Cause I knew I couldn't catch you
So I left the sky
And I fell behind

[Chorus]
We were one and the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
We were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made
Ricochet

[Verse 2]
If I was whole
I'd turn right now
I'd forget it and just walk away
'Cause I've been told
That I'm dragging it out
But I've been dying just to see your face
And all I wanted was to say ""goodbye""
Into the fortress that you're stuck behind
And in the silence now I realize
That after all I built the wall

[Chorus]
We were one and the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet
You were falling away
You left me with a bittersweet taste
But when I send my heart your way
It bounces off the walls you made

All these broken souls
They never make me whole
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart
All these broken souls
Each one more beautiful
They don't, they don't know my heart
They don't know my heart
I'll send out my soul
To worlds more beautiful
But they won't, they won't know my heart
It's the darkest part

[Chorus]
We were one and the same
Running like moths to the flame
You'd hang on every word I'd say
But now they only ricochet

There's no thing that I won’t go through
Even if I have to die for you

[Bridge]
And if the sun grows cold for you along the way
And if the stars don’t line to light the way
And when you fall away and crash back down below
I’ll search the skies for you and I’ll follow
I'll be in your afterglow
And I’ll bring you home

[Chorus]
Even if the sky does fall
Even if they take it all
I can't see but I'll follow you
Even if I'd die
And when all the fires burn
When everything is overturning
There's no thing that I won’t go through
Even if I have to die for you

I think I need help
I'm drowning in myself

Did someone turn the lights out?
Or is it just another dark cloud in my head?
'Cause I'm cut deep
My heart won't beat
Deep down low, it's killing me
If I wanna scratch out yesterday
I've got so much I need to say
I've got so much I need to say

I think I need help
'Cause I'm drowning in myself
It's sinking in
I can't pretend that I ain't been through hell

They're preying on my weakness
Believe it
I'm thinking to myself, no, not again
And I won't keep listening when temptation's creeping in
If I wanna make it another day

I can see the storms, in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard, in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?
I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting, ""Move!""
But there is no fucking way I'd leave you

[Chorus]
So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you

[Verse 2]
But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door?
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore?
Every day like a chambered round
A trigger pulled, a hammer click
A breath we hold, a world outside I can't control
No matter what I do

So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now
Like a house on fire we're up in flames

And how is it a thing?
That we just wanna hurt each other
I'm waiting out the rain
Feels like it's gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn
That all I ever did was for you
And I would do it all again
I would do it all again

'Til then I'll hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now

Roll your eyes, shave my head

And all I got is a chance to just say
(“Baby, love me! You've got me, runaway!”)

Have these wars come to our doorstep?

To a predetermined fate, are we condemned?
Or maybe we're a book without an end?
We're not stories, we're not actors
We're awake and in control
And this is not a dream

And set in motion something new
Forgetting what we know
An evolution overdue
Fight the current
Pull the ripcord
Get away!

To wash these roads away
Let's get off track and wander far
Same roads lead to same destinations
Follow nothing but your heart
We're talking in our sleep
And sleeping through our lives
We dream of the places where we never die
We step from the shadows
And into the light

Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?

In the corner of my room
A specter of the night
Silhouetted by the moon
We're floating fast over traffic lights
Bearing down on blackened skies
Colors burst as I close my eyes

Lay me down in golden dandelions

Follow me into the dark

In a painting of the past

In Brooklyn or some place like that

I’ve been wondering just what would peace be like
I’ve been staring into headlights

A monument to love unspoken
Carved into stone, “Unwilling to come undone”

Moving hotel to hotel

It’s finally done, the battle's lost, yet I feel I’ve won

[Verse 1]
Do you wanna start a cult with me?
I'm not vibrating like I oughta be
I need a purpose, I can't keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we're gonna need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I'm the guru
Wait, how do you spell ""epiphany""?

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Could I have your attention, please?
It's time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you're stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now you're sinking, what were you thinking?
That's all the time we have this week

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

[Bridge]
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to believe
And I know this doesn't make a lot of sense
You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I'm asking for's a little bit of faith
You know it's easy to, so easy to believe

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free, it'll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Oh!

You said it yourself you're scared of being alone
You said it yourself that you can crack the code
But the static you hear automatically keeps you exposed, on your own

You think it would've changed me, but I've always been the same
My label tried to sue me—TMZ tried to screw me
Blabbermouth can fuckin' suck it, 'cause they never fuckin' knew me
Everybody seems like they're waitin' for me to die
Talk shit behind my back—can't look me in the eye
They say I'm overrated—that I should've already faded
Give a shit about it all because I love to be so hated

I barely get to eat, and when I finally get to sleep
I get drug out of bed for another meet-and-greet
I shake the hand of every fan—put on a happy face
Spread so fuckin' thin, I'm all over the place
I hate riding on the bus—I hate flyin' in the planes
Sedate myself just to kill the pain
I have no life—forgot the hope
The whole thing's turned into one big joke

It's a quarter past midnight
And the speakers are blowing
Yeah, yeah, we want the bodies on the billboards
Not the lives underneath them
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and now we're crawling up the walls again
And it's a quarter past twelve
And you said we'd leave this place in dust
And fall from heaven straight through hell
We never know what we have
We never knew what we had

We keep on running
Running through a red light
Like we're trying to burn the night away
Away-way, oh, away-way, oh
Why are we always chasing after something
Like we're trying to throw our lives away?
Away-way, oh, away-way, oh

Help me piece it all together, darling
Before it falls apart, oh
Help me piece it all together

We never knew what we had
I never know what I've had

[Verse 1]
Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

[Verse 2]
And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly but you need some imagination

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

[Bridge]
I can't stop sweating or control my feet
Got a 20-stone monkey that I just can't beat
I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
And there's a feeling, you're replacing embrace

[Chorus]
It's true that all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

[Outro]
Oh, I'll try to get a job in a bank, I think
Danny spent the time trying to pack in the drinks for me
I feel sick and I know I that I'll lose but
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)

[Intro]
(Listen now f—)

[Verse 1]
No one can take me out of this mess
I do it to myself
I lost my phone, my keys, what else?
The acid doesn't help
I'm paranoid as hell and I wanna
Go home but there's no place to run

[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
In the heat of the summer!

[Verse 2]
I've got to figure something out
But I don't know where to start
I found my keys under the couch
But I'm scared of going out
Having all these doubts and I'd rather
Stay home 'cause there's no place to run

[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer

[Bridge]
I'll be wasting time
In the sunshine
I'll be flying high
In the summer time

[Chorus]
Feel like it's been forever
Since I had my shit together
I just do what I wanna
In the heat of the summer
If I could roll up another
Baby, I could see in technicolor
I just do what I gotta
In the heat of the summer
In the heat of the summer

I remember your silhouette on Dyes Inlet
Against the silver sheen of a moon like painted glass
Under stars out on a pier; a celestial sphere
We were weightless as the waves that disappeared

[Chorus: Benjamin Gibbard]
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

[Verse 2: Benjamin Gibbard with Lauren Mayberry]
We shared a clove cigarette on the parapet
As the TVs glowed from the windows of the model homes
And I'd never be that close again to your lips and perfect skin
As the tide receded into the unknown

[Verse 1]
Sit enthroned in white grandeur
But tired
And shift a wisp of wayward silver hair
From your eyes
I'd never seen you unkempt before
As you whisper darling close the door
Well, how have I not made a note of every word
You ever said
And time is not on our side but I'll pretend that it's alright
She says the Lord has a plan
But admits it's pretty hard to understand

[Chorus]
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you

[Verse 2]
Are you afraid
However could you not be
In this rosy light
This is strange
I feel a hand come through the mirror
Pointing at the light
Point at the light we never see
As you put your feathered arms over me

[Chorus]
Before you leave
You must know you are beloved
And before you leave
Remember I was with you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved

[Bridge]
We'll sit and talk the stars down from the sky
And I'll not forget the chaos in your eyes love

[Chorus]
And as you leave
You must know you are beloved
And as you leave
I can see the wild has come for you
And as you leave
I won't hold you back beloved
And as you leave
See my children playing at your feet

The finest in the land

Yeah, the words you know so well
You're in and out of fashion
In Hollywood of Hell

Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no

Well, I love you in that movie show
Can I have your autograph?
It's so funny you have such charm
The whole thing made me laugh

Obetrol and cocktails
You're counting all your rings
They all said they loved you
Didn't they, darling?
Well, they've taken all your things

When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe

You're a one woman show
But I'm not gonna lie to you

Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all

We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them

Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

And I don't know why I drown my mind in everything they say
It hit me like a hurricane (Hurricane)
It hit me like a tidal wave (Tidal wave)
And I don't know why I drown my mind, it got the best of me

With your life on the line
Ready to die for something
When you're at the divide
And you're down to nothing
Look into my eyes
Believe me that the storm is coming
Believe me that the storm is coming
Down, down, down
It's coming down

It hit me like a tidal wave

Count down the thunder
I think we're too close for comfort
So no, don't rock the boat and don't calm the storm
God already gave you His answer
Blink, I'm sorry, it's over, the whistle's been blown, I
Think you got the wrong number, I'm breaking up
Wanna make a connection, can't get no reception
Leave a message after the tone

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like
I think something's fucking wrong with me

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Drown myself in alcohol, that shit never helps at all
I might say some stupid things tonight when you pick up this call
I've been hearing silence on the other side for way too long
I can taste it on my tongue, I can tell that something's wrong, but
I guess it's just my life and I can take it if I wanna
But I cannot hide in hills of California
Because these hills have eyes, and I got paranoia
I hurt myself sometimes, is that too scary for you?

Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night

Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night
Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night

And figure it all out on your own
Take drugs (Take drugs) on gravestones (Gravestones)
To figure it all out on your own

Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights

Find me alone at midnight
Inside my mind, tryna get things right

I need a short-term fix for a long-term problem
Can I learn to love these chains?
I know I had a point but now I forgot it
While I'm circlin' the drain

No, I can't stop feelin' like every day's exactly the same
With a one-track mind I don't think I can change

A dance with demons on a high wire
Lift me up

Hard truth cuts both ways
Pourin' out my heart

In between a rock and a hard place
Trying to find your way through the dark days

You flipped the world upside down
And right now you don't wanna show it
'Cause you don't think that anyone will notice
Until you tell someone
You'll feel like you're the only one

But I know we're not alright
Everybody says they're fine

It's never easy when you're breaking down
But I'll be there when you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
Face down in the days that we wasted
Trying to find our way through the mazes
We could wait this out
Or walk through that fire somehow
You trying to put together all the pieces
When you should turn around now and leave 'em
'Cause you could lose your mind
Trying to live back in time

[Verse 1]
Open up, drink it in, don't ask too many questions
Become the vessel for the shame they feed you through suggestion
There's a rumor on the breeze, secrets that bring you to your knees
We made the problem, we are the poison, whoa
Close your eyes, surrender your beliefs to them for holding
Wait patiently to hear what ever-changing lines are showing
There's a whisper in the wind, eventual storm that's rolling in
They have the answers, cure for the cancer we've become
That we've become

[Chorus]
All they wanted was violence
To plant their seeds and divide us
If they want the worst that's inside us
We'll bring on the violence, the violence

[Verse 2]
Back and forth, daily take apart what you've been building (Building)
Everything you have is to be fed into the system
There's a force out pushing fear, a deafening silence drawing near
Sit, absorb it, guess we've been toxic all along, all along

All they wanted was violence
To plant their seeds and divide us
If they want the worst that's inside us

‘Cause we know this feeling all a little too well

[Chorus]
Listen, the distance between us could’ve took a while
Once we closed that difference, you'd turn up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile
As if one of our longshots paid off
One of our longshots paid off

[Bridge]
And it's by the by
If it makes those nights fly
We're side by side again
And now, we’re all careless and love drunk
You know exactly how it goes
When you’re giving us all kind of reason
Thought I had to go and follow the heart I believe in
'Cause one of us must know
When you're giving us all kind of reason
Thought I had to go and follow the heart I believe in
'Cause in the past it's done me good
So good, so good, so good

[Chorus]
Listen, the distance between us could’ve took a while
Once we closed that difference, you'd turn up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile
As if one of our longshots paid off
Listen, the distance between us could’ve took a while
Once we closed that difference, you'd turn up like a friend of mine
Every once in a while, the little things make me smile

One of our longshots paid off

I'm looking for you every way
No sign of you when I wake up

I tried it once before but I didn't get too far
I felt a lot of pain but it didn't stop my heart
And all I really wanted was someone to give a little fuck
But I waited there forever and nobody even looked up
I tried it once before and I think I might've messed up
I struggled with the veins and I guess I didn't bleed enough
But maybe I'm alive 'cause I didn't really wanna die
But nothing very special ever happens in my life

Take the blade away from me

All the blood escaping me won't end the pain

I tried it like before and this time I made a deep cut
I thought about my friends and the way I didn't give enough

I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?

[Verse 1: Halsey & YUNGBLUD]
I think I missed you callin' on the other line
I'm just thinkin' all these thoughts up in my mind
Talkin' love but I can't even read the signs
I would sell my soul for a bit more time
You stain all on my body like you're red wine
You're the fuckin' acid to my alkaline
You run your middle finger up and down my spine
I'm sorry there was no one to apologize
I'm so fuckin' sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I've been playing somebody and it's helping nobody
And her lipstick arithmetic didn't stick
And now I'm sick, throwing fits
And yeah, I've seen you in my head every fuckin' day since I left
You on the floor with your hands 'round your head
And I'm down and depressed
All I want is your head on my chest
Touchin' feet in my bed

Tell me what you need
I can make you more than what you are
Come and lay the roses on the floor
Every single Sunday, don't get bored
I just want to freeze
I can give you more than what you are
Now I see you standing all alone
I never thought the world would turn to stone

Got the call on the streets of Seattle
She said, ""Honey, I don't got much time to talk""
I broke down 'cause I knew what was next
And she said, ""I'm okay, but I'm locked in a holding cell
'Til someone gets me out
Can you help me? I have no one else""
So there I was, a defenseless middle kid
Crying out for the right words to say
Sorry, I can't do anything at all
So I hung up and called you
I hung up and called you

'Cause you were the one, oh
You were the one I needed

So I took a stupid fight with him after the accident
Funny now 'cause I thought it was your defense
'Cause I thought you were sober then
So there I was, a lost kid looking for a home that he once knew

She went (Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Indigo up in heaven today
(Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Bombs going boom-ba-ba-boom
She say

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Choir]
I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune

[Refrain: Chris Martin & Choir]
But he went (Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Tulips the colour of honey today
(It's true, true, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Bombs going boom-ba-ba-boom
He say

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Choir]
Oh, I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again (Yeah)

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Cherubim, Seraphim soon
Come sailing us home by the light of the moon

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Choir]
Oh, I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and feel home again

[Refrain: Chris Martin & Choir]
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
I guess we'll be raised on our own then
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause I want to be with you 'til the world ends
I want to be with you 'til the whole world ends

[Outro: Moses Martin]
Boom boom kah, buba de kah
Boom boom kah, buba de kah
Boom boom kah, buba de kah
Boom

[Verse 1]
Now the sea eats the sky
But they say it's a lie
There's no birds left to fly
We'll hide out
Oh, the weather's against us
Houses underground
The flowers upside down
In our dreams
In the eye of the storm
The land where you were born
Try to make no sound
We hide out
'Cause they watch us in sleep
The language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep

[Pre-Chorus]
In our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams
In our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams

[Chorus 1]
I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
In a world upside down

[Verse 2]
Oh, to dream this all off
In the islands of the mind
The places they can't find
We'll hide out
And the black sky came down
And the cities underground
The flowers upside down
In our dreams
Oh, to meet you again
To pass you on the stairs
To see you everywhere
In my dreams
'Cause they watch us in sleep
And the language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep

[Pre-Chorus]
To ourselves in our dreams, in our dreams
In our dreams, in our dreams, in our dreams

[Chorus 1]
I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down

[Chorus 2]
I said I'm so sorry
That the world has fallen down
I wish I could do something more
I could shout it out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
In a world upside down

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
(Up)
(Upside down, oh)
(Upside down, oh)
(Upside down, oh)

[Outro]
Back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer
I hope you could be found out of ground, our long lost brother
We share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
Back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer
I hope you could be found out of ground, our long lost brother
We share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
Back to the days of yore, when we were sure of a good long summer

[Intro]
Never thought it would be like this

[Verse 1]
What will you do now that you're gone?
Onto somebody new, well, that didn't take long
And where you're gonna go? Not that I care
And who can you trust now that I'm not there?

[Chorus]
Never known such unhappiness
Never thought it would be like this
What will I do, now that you're gone?
Now that you're gone

[Verse 2]
And what will you do now you're all alone?
Who's gonna keep you warm out there in the cold?
And who's gonna rescue you when you're lost at sea?
And who's gonna love you if it isn't me?

[Chorus]
Never known such unhappiness
Never thought it would end like this
Oh, what will I do, now that you're gone?
Now that you're gone

[Outro]
Now you're lost in the wilderness
You never dreamed it would end like this
What will they say now that you're gone?
Now that you're, now that you're gone

[Verse 1]
You were cracking all your fingers
With your eyes fixed to the floor
Sound had echoed down the street
By the monument you hear
Man is screaming through a megaphone
""Get your hands off the Middle East""
Every word would heard the cynical
Every word would cut your teeth

[Hook]
And he will play God
And he will play God

[Verse 2]
It's all the same down in the capital
All the suits and clattered feet
Sewer rats will shower the underground
In a race to make ends meet

[Hook]
And he will play God
And he will play God

[Chorus]
Am I mistaken or are we breaking
Under weight from the long time
That he played God?
Am I mistaken or are we breaking
Under weight from the long time
That he played God?

[Hook]
He will play God

[Verse 3]
No matter who you are or where you've been
He is watching from the screen
Keeps a keen eye on the in-between
From the people to the queen

[Hook]
And he will play God
And he will play God

[Chorus]
Am I mistaken or are we breaking
Under weight from the long time
That he played God?
Am I mistaken or are we breaking
Under weight from the long time
That he played God?

[Outro]
He will play God
He will play God
He will play God
He will play God
