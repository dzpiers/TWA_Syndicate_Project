Descontrola tu' cadera' (Sexy!)
Y ese fuego que quema por dentro y lento
Te convierte en fiera (Rah)

Mueve la cabeza y sacude duro (¡Don!)

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (At us)

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Sex (Sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep ​*horn honks*​
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world (You could travel the world)
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us (Once you party with us)
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry & (Snoop Dogg)]
California girls, we're unforgettable (California)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg & Katy Perry, Both]
Toned, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (Uh!)
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just the king and a queenie
Katy, my lady (Yeah?)
Lookie here, baby (Uh-huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representin' California (Oh-oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Katy Perry & (Snoop Dogg)]

Ça t’prend les tripes, ça te prend la tête
Et puis tu pries pour qu'ça s’arrête
Mais c’est ton corps, c’est pas le ciel
Alors tu t’bouches plus les oreilles
Et là tu cries encore plus fort, et ça persiste

Ella se hace la bruta pa' cotizarse
Conmigo en frente, ella se hace la gata en celo contigo
Te cotorrea el oído pa' tenerte en alta
Ella muere por ti, tú por mí es que matas

Mientras ella se pasa en su BM al lado mío
Yo de aquí no me voy, lo que está pa' mi
Ninguna va poder quitármelo de un tirón

Mientras ella te complace con todos tus caprichos
Yo te llevo al malecón por un caminito
Me dicen que tu novia anda con un rifle
Porque me vio bailando mambo pa' ti, ¿qué no lo permite?
Yo no tengo la culpa de que tú te enamore'
Mientras él te compra flores yo compro cond— ooh!
Yo soy loca con mi tigre
Cuantas más rayas mejor y mira eso es lo que dicen (Shhh)

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1]
You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

[Chorus]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love

You, you, you got your high brow, switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look

See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

'Cause it sure seems (It sure seems) you got no doubts (No doubts)
But we all see (We all see) you got your head in the clouds

Turn around and give it to me, shawty, get paid
Do it for them girls, they be jealous anyway
On stage, I wanna be amazed
Pop that, drop that, it's ya birthday
Top that, got stacks, work for this stage
Stop that, lock that, work it in place

Let loose, get a Louis like hers

Back it up like that, yes, sir

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
Oh, oh, baby, want some more, baby?

I'm impressed the way you makin' it bounce
Workin' the middle again, makin' it jiggle again
Hello, let's go, just know
I love the way you do it, how you take it to the floor
Show 'em how you do it like you ready for the pole
Baby, you can do it fifty times in a row
Them rows get ready for yo' pose
Lights, camera, action, lose control
Ain't got to practice, you's a pro
All types of magic, lose the clothes
Gotta party like this yo' world
Make yo' booty go stupid, girl
So hot and I love them curves
Off top, shawty, mark my words

Letra de ""Addicted to You"" por Shakira
[Translation]

[Verso 1]
Debe ser el perfume que usas
O el agua con la que te bañas
Pero cada cosita que haces
A mí me parece una hazaña
Me besaste esa noche
Cual si fuera el último día de tu boca
Cada vez que yo me acuerdo
Yo siento en mi pecho el peso de una roca

[Pre-Coro]
Son tus ojos marrones
Esa veta verdosa
Es tu cara de niño
Y esa risa nerviosa

[Coro]
I'm addicted to you
Porque es un vicio tu piel
Baby, I'm addicted to you
Quiero que te dejes querer
I'm addicted to you
Porque es un vicio tu piel
Baby, I'm addicted to you
Quiero que te dejes querer

[Verso 2]
Por el puro placer de flotar
Ahora si me llevó la corriente
Ya no puedo dormir ni comer
Como lo hace la gente decente
Un recuerdo ha quedado
Así como un broche prendido en mi almohada
Y tú en cambio que tienes memoria de pez
No te acuerdas de nada

[Pre-Coro]
Son tus manos de hombre
El olor de tu espalda
Lo que no tiene nombre
Lo logró tu mirada

[Coro]
I'm addicted to you
Porque es un vicio tu piel
Baby, I'm addicted to you
Quiero que te dejes querer
I'm addicted to you
Porque es un vicio tu piel
Baby, I'm addicted to you
Quiero que te dejes querer

[Verse 1]
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Verse 2]
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece, I'm complete

No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Chorus]
(You) You make me (Make me)
Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back (No)
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real (Oh), so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep

I'm lookin' down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin'
Hittin' my head against the wall

Mama's tellin' me I should think twice

If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?

[Letra de ""La Despedida""]

[Intro]
(Huh, yeah)
(Come on)
Da-ddy (Tu sabe' quien es ma, you know)
Da-ddy (D Y)
Da-ddy (Cómo dice, cómo dice)

[Coro]
Antes que te vayas dame un beso
Sé que soñaré con tu regreso
Mi vida no es igual
Ahora que te perdí, ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar?
¿Cómo te voy a olvidar?
(Dame mambo, come on)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Da-ddy
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Da-ddy (D Y)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Da-ddy (Mundial)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verso 1]
Sé que me dijiste que el amor existe y su poder hace lo que sea
Que cambie el destino y quédate conmigo porque no soporto la idea
Con amor a la distancia fortalece la confianza y termina siendo una odisea
Así es la razón pero mi corazón va ganando en esta pelea

[Puente]
Y tu recuerdo me está matando
Hasta la muerte aquí estaréé esperando
Nunca lo olvides, te sigo amando
Hasta la muerte aquí estaréé esperando
Da-ddy
Da-ddy
Da-ddy
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo)

[Coro]
Antes que te vayas dame un beso
Sé que soñaré con tu regreso
Mi vida no es igual
Ahora que te perdí, ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar?
¿Cómo te voy a olvidar?

[Verso 2]
Hablé con el hombre, que vi en el espejo
Me dijo deja que vuele y se vaya lejos
Si vuelve ese amor es tuyo y si no vuelve nunca fue tuyo
Entonces sigue mi sabio consejo

[Puente]
Y tu recuerdo me está matando
Hasta la muerte aquí estaréé esperando
Nunca lo olvides, te sigo amando
Hasta la muerte aquí estaré esperando
(Por Siempre)

[Coro]
Antes que te vayas dame un beso (Solo quiero un beso ma’)
Sé que soñaré con tu regreso
Mi vida no es igual
Ahora que te perdí, ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar?
¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? (Solo dime cómo yo te olvido ma’)
¿Cómo te voy a olvidar?  (Solo dime cómo yo te olvido ma’)
¿Cómo te voy a olvidar?
(Mundial)

[Outro]
Te veré al final del camino
Te veré al final del camino
Si así lo quiere el destino
Llegó la despedida, en contra de nuestra voluntad hay que decir
Adiós

[Verse 1]
You want me to come over, I got an excuse
I might be holding your hand, but I'm holding it loose
Go to talk then we choke its like our necks in a noose
Avoid the obvious, we should be facing the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda' shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes, imagine life without ya

[Chorus]
And the love kickstarts again
Starts again
And the love kickstarts again
Starts again

[Verse 2]
It's the same old you, the same old me
You get bored and I get cold feet
Get high get wandering eyes
Forget I've never ever had it so sweet
I realize what I got when I'm out of town
'Cos deep down you're my girl in a golden crown
My princess and I don't wanna let you down
No I don't wanna let you down down down down...

[Verse 1]
You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they’d fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It’s hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I’d rather stay awake when I’m asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Bridge]
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
’Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

[Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I’ll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Outro]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams...

[Verse 1]
It's in your eyes, a colour fade-out
Looks like a new transition
Is starting up and shaking your ground
Turning your head to see a new day calling
Does it feel like a head to lean on
A snapshot from where you were born?
I'm looking for your hand in the rough
You're caught in the wire
Well, I'll lift you out

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
Leaning on the action
Caught in a cellphone's rays
Bleeding on the sofa
Staring at the wayside
He's coming and she knows it
Even if she knows why
Footsteps in the hallway
Girl, you haven't got time

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta get out
Go far away
You gotta get out
Go far away

[Drop]

[Verse 3]
Darkness in the bedroom
Maybe she's resting up
Maybe she was out late
Just come back from the club
I can't hear her breathing
Something doesn't seem right
Killer in the hallway
We're living on a set time

[Pre-Chorus]
We gotta get out
Go far away
We gotta get out
Go far away

[Verse 1]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again

[Verse 2]
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled

Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends
Hey, bring it on baby, all your friends
You're the shit and I love that body
You wanna ball, explicit, I swear you're good, I won't tell nobody
You got a BFF, I wanna see that girl, it's all women invited
Hairdos and nails, that Louie, Chanel all up in the party
President's in my wallet, no rules I'm 'bout it
Blow the whistle for the hotties
I got it, shorty, it's never too much, can't be doing too much
Ten to one of me, I can handle that love
Outta of my reach, we can all get buzzed

Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends

Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth

Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)

You're Black, white, beige, cholo descent
You're Lebanese, you're Orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied, or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby, you were born this way

No matter gay, straight, or bi

No no no no no

A melanated mother looking at her newborn
A black boy, he see his father in his true form
Strong, vulnerable, grace and poise, and lovable
Ungovernable, ride or die on we thuggin' to
Fondness, tenderness, caring, endearment
Intimacy, spirits you can feel it
Beloved, up above it always covered I can feel it
Thriving always flourishing, somebody tryna to kill it
But we
Stay resilient as the world stay spinning
Stay feeling with that love healing
I feel unity
Mutiny against my oppressors is what be moving me
Love with no power sentimentally
Empower no love, it is tyranny you feeling me?
Warmth and connection to my people most critically
Black love criminalized, seen as a threat
To white supremacy on every corner of the map

[Bridge]
My love
It’s on
Your face
They look

[Chorus 1]
Deep in the brown eyes lie dignity and pride
Rebuilding generations, loving the darkest nation
Hair and skin, texture
It's a celebration
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Seen everywhere, validated and acknowledged
Picked the black doll in a test paying homage
Many different shades on an earth tone rainbow
Stopped look and listen, see we glisten and our frame glow
Pleasure like a soul food plate when you ain't ate
Collard greens, mac and cheese, red velvet cake
We can celebrate
Set it straight
Libation meditate
Increase and educate
Decrease the murder rate
Sharp like in a [?]
Suited and booted
Civilize and refine
Move as a movement
Gorgeous and beautiful
Uplift and multiply
Platforms generate
Incomes to amplify
How we see ourselves, be ourselves, see our wealth
Dreaming of equity, power, and mental health
Self-determination, respect, and dignity
Need spaces that reflect our identity

My love
It’s on
Your face
They look

Nah nah nah nah nah

What's good people
It's a pleasure to be here

It’s quite rare to see us, you know, all intact
You know what I mean, like
Public enemy for real
Feeling like heavy
Heavy handle like the sky’s made of metal
You feel me?

Tokenism, flag waving, white [?]
Blame the victim, paternalism, the lie is missing

Covert, overt
Saviors here to work
Self-appointed
Trained to disconnect the past from the present moment
Wired to resist the truth
Post-racial attitudes
Claiming [?] through reverse
Benefits from terror moves
Beneficiaries of terrorism and argumentive
Country built off this false premise, y'all offended?
Here to crack on my bones and teeth, no relief
Impunity, for police, there is no belief
Segregation, separatism, restricted covenants
Withdraw the funding, redraw the country
Profiling holidays with slaveowners bootstrap pull up
Standing on my back tell me to get up with sit ups
Conflict, dissonance, instability
Uncertainty, lack of control, stifles ability
Humiliate, reduce, destroy
Imagination that produces joy
Inside the minds of black girls and boys

[Chorus 2]
Lynching, hate crimes, drawn swastikas
[?], burnin’ crosses as they toss to us, [?]
Tokenism, flag waving, white [?]
Blame the victim, paternalism, the lie is missing

[Intro: Redfoo]
Sorry for party rocking

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
Yo, I be up in a party looking for a hottie to bone
I got a drink in my hand and they just called buffalo (Buffalo!)
Poppin' bottles in the house with the models in the V.I.P
All the girls make out for the whole damn club to see

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Let's go
People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking
Neighbors complain saying, ""Turn it down!""
Sorry for party rocking
Haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking
When they talk shit, we just be like
Sorry for party rocking

[Verse 2: Skyblu]
Baby, baby, baby, I'm awfully crazy
Off Ciroc, off Patron, shit whatever's tasty!
We don't got no manners hanging off the rafters
Let's go drink for drink, a hundred bucks she won't out last us
Check my style, take a good look, I'm fresh, bitch
In my whip with music so loud I'm deaf, bitch
Getting brain at a red light with people watching
Sorry for party rocking

[Bridge: Redfoo]
If you show up already toe up, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if you're blacked out with your sack out, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if you throw up in your hoe's cup, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
And if she has a hissy fit cause you're whiskey dick, this is what you say
Sorry for party rocking
Oh!

[Verse 3: Redfoo]
I don't give a fuck when I'm in the club
Sipping bub, really drunk, and I see a fat booty
Gotta have it, I'm a grab it, it's a habit, automatic like Uzi
Uzi with the sick flow
Make a chick go crazy and flash them ta-ta's
Redfoo, the dude, a true party rocker

[Verse 4: Skyblu]
I'm true to the game too
It's called beer pong and I can't lose
I got a bunch of bad bitches in the back
With Ciroc on tap and a little bit of Grey Goose, ooh
Oh yeah we killin shit
With our money we diligent
So here's a sorry in advance
No hard feelings bitch
Sorry for party rocking

[Chorus: Redfoo]
People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking
Neighbors complain saying, ""Turn it down!""
Sorry for party rocking
Haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking

Rush
Pull me under
The world is at my feet
And it’s no wonder

Your eyes speak to me
They tell me be calm
They tell me be strong

Swimming out so deep
Now I can’t breathe
And it’s exactly where I belong

Cause it feels like the ride of a lifetime
And nothing’s gonna save us now
Let the waves come crashing down

Cause it feels like I’m right for the first time
And every time I take you in
I feel my heart skip a beat again
I'm drowning in your love

Love
It’s taking over
There's no in between to offer me some cover
Ohh oh

The tide is coming, I don't know if I can take it
I lose my focus, lose my focus
With every breath I feel my inhibition breaking
I can’t control it, no no no

Cause it feels like the ride of a lifetime
And nothing’s gonna save us now
Let the waves come crashing down

Cause it feels like I’m right for the first time
And every time I take you in
I feel my heart skip a beat again
I’m drowning in your love

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?

Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her Black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read, ""No apologies""
The other said, ""Love is cursed by monogamy""
That's something that the pastor don't preach
That's something that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money, we can't keep
But we'll probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?

93,International Love (feat. Chris Brown),Planet Pit (Deluxe Version),Pitbull,2011-06-17,227280,74,"

[Intro: Pitbull & Chris Brown]
Went from Mr. 305, (Dade County), to Mr. Worldwide
(All around the world)
Ayy, ayy
Now we're International, so international, international, so international
Oh, yeah (woo!)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
You can't catch me, boy (Can't catch me, boy)
I'm overseas and about a hundred G's per show
Don't test me, boy (Don't test me, boy)
'Cause I rap with the best for sure
305 'til the death of me, cremate my body and let the ocean have what's left of me
But for now, forget about that
Blow the whistle, baby, you're the referee, dalé

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (Yeah)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (Chris Brown, woo!)
Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat (oh, yeah)
Oh, girl, it's, it's international love, oh, oh, oh, yeah, it's international love (woo!)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I don’t play football, but I've touched down everywhere
(Everywhere? Everywhere)
I don’t play baseball, but I've hit a home run everywhere (Everywhere? Everywhere) (Dale)
I've been to countries and cities I can’t pronounce and the places on the globe I didn't know existed (Yeah)
In Romania, she pulled me to the side and told me, ""Pit, you can have me and my sister""
In Lebanon, yeah, the women are bomb
And in Greece, you've guessed it the women are sweet
Been all around the world, but I ain't gon' lie
There's nothing like Miami’s heat (Dalé)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (Yeah)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (Uh-huh, woo!)
Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat (oh, yeah) (woo!)
Oh, girl, it's, it's international love, oh, oh, oh, yeah, it's international love (We're international, let's rise)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Down in DR they looking for visas
I ain't talking credit cards, if you know what I mean
En Cuba, la cosa esta dura, but the women get down, if you know what I mean
In Colombia the women got everything done, but they some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil, they freaky with big ol' boobs and they thongs, blue yellow and green
En L.A., tengo la Mexicana
En New York, tengo la boricua
Besitos para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah
Y en Miami tengo a cualquiera

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
You put it down like New York City, hey, I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles (oh, whoa), my fantasy (Woo!)
Hotter than Miami (You're hotter than Miami), I-I-I feel the heat
Oh, it's international love, oh, oh, oh, yeah, it's international love (All around the world, international, woo!)

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
There’s not a place that your love don’t affect me, baby
So don’t ever change
I crossed the globe when I'm with you, baby
Hey, oh, whoa
Chris Brown, this for the women worldwide, lets ride (woo!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (Woo)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (Ayy, ayy)
Hotter than Miami (You're hotter than Miami), I-I-I feel the heat (305)
Oh, yeah, it's international love, oh, oh, oh, yeah, it's international love (Woo! Let's ride)
You put it down like (Down) New York City, I never sleep (Down) (woo!)
Wild like Los Angeles (Los Angeles), my fantasy
Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat, oh, yeah (305)
Oh, oh, it's international love, oh, oh, oh, it's international love (Woo!)

[Outro: Chris Brown & (Pitbull)]
Oh, oh, oh
(You're international, so international)
Oh, oh, oh
(You're international, so international)
Oh, oh, oh
(You're international, so international)
Oh, oh, oh
(You're international, so international)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
International love (Surrounded by beautiful girls)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

94,Call Me Maybe,Kiss,Carly Rae Jepsen,2012-01-01,193400,77,"

[Verse 1]
I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Verse 2]
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Bridge]
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Outro]
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
So call me maybe

Yo, what I gotta do to show these girls that I own 'em?
Some call me Nicki, and some call me Roman

Sexy, sexy that’s all I do
If you need a bad bitch, let me call a few
Pumps on, and the little mini-skirts is out
I see some good girls, I'ma turn 'em out
Okay, bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, hey?
Bottle, sip, bottle, guzzle
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle, let's go

Music makes me high

[Verse 2]
I wanna do it for the night, night
So, get me now, and knock this over

Baby, we won't do it for life, life, oh

[Verse 1: Sia]
You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized, but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: Sia]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium

[Verse 2: Sia]
Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost towns and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
Talking loud, not saying much

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away

[Chorus: Sia]
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium

I'm better, so much better now
I see the light, touch the light, we're together now
I'm better, so much better now
Look to the skies, gives me life, we're together now

[Refrain]
We've only just begun, hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes, you'll find us chasing the sun
They said this day wouldn't come, we refused to run
We've only just begun, you'll find us chasing the sun

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And when they say life's faded
We're gonna play in the dark 'til it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see it coming, I will never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

[Verse 2]
I'm never, I'm never down
Lying here, staring up, and you're looking down
I'm never, I'm never down
Live forever, forever with you around

[Refrain]
We've only just begun, hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes, you'll find us chasing the sun
They said this day wouldn't come, we refused to run
We've only just begun, you'll find us chasing the sun
The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun
You'll find us chasing the sun

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun

Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun

Witness, I got the heart of 20 men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunning from the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates, take a genius to understand me

How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-lo-love you
'Cause I lo-lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do

[Chorus]
Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave
Primadonna girl

[Verse 1]
Would you do anything for me?
Buy a big diamond ring for me?
Would you get down on your knees for me?
Pop that pretty question right now, baby
Beauty queen on a silver screen
Living life like I'm in a dream
I know I've got a big ego
I really don't know why it's such a big deal though

[Refrain 1]
(Ooh) And I'm sad to the core, core, core
(Yeah) Every day is a chore, chore, chore
(Wow) When you give, I want more, more, more
I wanna be adored

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave
Primadonna girl

[Verse 2]
Fill the void up with celluloid
Take a picture, I'm with the boys
Get what I want 'cause I ask for it
Not because I'm really that deserving of it
Living life like I'm in a play
In the limelight I want to stay
I know I've got a big ego
I really don't know why it's such a big deal though

[Refrain 2]
(Ooh) Going up, going down, down, down
(Yeah) Anything for the crown, crown, crown
(Wow) When the lights dimming down, down, down
I spin around

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm a Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave

[Chorus]
Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave

120,Let Me Love You (Until You Learn To Love Yourself),R.E.D. (Deluxe Edition),Ne-Yo,2012-01-01,251626,68,"

[Verse 1]
Much as you blame yourself, you can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love that was even remotely real
How can you understand something that you never had?
Ooh, baby, if you let me, I can help you out with all of that

[Chorus]
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
And all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness gets brought to life
I'll take you there
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you, baby, oh
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you, baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you, oh

[Verse 2]
I can see the pain behind your eyes
It's been there for quite a while
I just wanna be the one to remind you what it is to smile
I would like to show you what true love can really do

[Chorus]
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself

Everyone's itchin' for beauty, but just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it, then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

[Verse 1: Sia]
A shot in the dark
A past, lost in space
And where do I start?
The past and the chase
You hunted me down
Like a wolf, a predator
I felt like a deer in love lights

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with a she wolf who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes?
'Cause I'm falling to pieces

[Chorus: Sia]
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces

[Verse 2: Sia]
Did she lie and wait?
Was I bait to pull you in?
The thrill of the kill
You feel is a sin
I lay with the wolves
Alone, it seems
I thought I was part of you

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with a she wolf who has brought me to my knees

Happy life with the machines
Scattered around the room
Look what they made, they made it for me
Happy technology

Outside, the lions roam
Feeding on remains
We'll never leave, look at us, now
So in love with the way we are

Here, the world that the children made
The world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made

Every night, they rock us to sleep
Digital family
Is it real or is it a dream?
Can you believe in machines?

Outside, the beating sun
Can you hear the screams?
We'll never leave, look at us, now
So in love with the way we are

[Verse 1: Foxes]
High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash 'cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

[Chorus: Foxes]
'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you

This house party is crazy, my crew is hela wavy
Yo, flip the cut, then say what’s up, then slide out with your lady

Fill that red cup to the top, birthday shots

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

[Verse 1]
You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

[Chorus]
So I'll put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Verse 2]
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

[Chorus]
So I'll put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Bridge]
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing

[Hook: Trevor Guthrie]
And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it to the shore without your light
No I don’t even know if I’m alive
Oh, oh, oh without you now
This is what it feels like
Oh, oh, oh
This is what it feels like

And I don’t even know how I survive
I won’t make it down the road with one headlight
No I don’t even know if I’m alive

Is that what devils do?
Took you so low
Where only fools go
I shook the angel in you

Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do

Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise

Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?

Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room
Got me hypnotised, I'm getting high on the perfume

Telling all the girls, all around the world
My last name must be Robbins
Cause I'm baskin' in these asses
All thirty-one flavors keep calling
My-my-my-my vanilla Cinderella
Love when I tell her ""drop it""
My butter pecan Rican
But I-I love my chocolate

D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old
And something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I was done with staying, getting it wrong (Yeah)
Then everything is alright (Woo)
Got them girls going Heidi Klum
The Kardashians, Rihanna, all types
If you ain't lean, then you in the wrong scene
If you ain't high, then you're not on my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need no sparklers or nothin'
Just keep the bottles coming all night

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die

We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, ""is it right or is it wrong?""
If only fame had an IV
Baby, could I bear being away from you
I found the vein, put it in here

I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause (I know what you're waiting for)

Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch (make it real loud)

Oh
Oh

Oh
I think I’d have a heart attack
Oh
I think I’d have a heart attack
Oh
I think I’d have a heart attack
Oh
I think I’d have a heart attack
Putting my defenses up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack

[Verse 1]
Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I’m never good enough
When I don’t care, I can play ‘em like a Ken doll
Won’t wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you, make me so nervous that I just can’t hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won’t let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack

[Verse 2]
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It’s just not fair
Pain’s more trouble than it all is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can’t hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won’t let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don’t wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack

[Bridge]
The feelings are lost in my lungs
They’re burning, I’d rather be numb
And there’s no one else to blame
So instead, I’ll take off in a run
I’m flying too close to the sun and I’ll burst into flames

[Chorus]
I think I’d have a heart attack (Heart attack)
I think I’d have a heart attack (-Tack)
Oh, I think I’d have a heart attack
I think I’d have a heart attack
Oh, I think I’d have a heart attack

[Verse 1]
For my theme song (Black)
My leather black jeans on (Black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (Black)
Enter the kingdom (Black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (Black)
Came to see me in my black skin (Black)
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (Black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (Black)
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq, bitch

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Refrain]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (Down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (Now)
But there's nowhere to go (Now)
And there's no way to slow (Down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2]
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
Early morning cartoon shit (Black)
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb, bitch (Black)
Black out the room, bitch (Black)
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
These niggas ain't doin' shit (Black)
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on, homie, what happened?
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready—ready for action—action

[Chorus]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 1: LoDeck]
My glamorous life, ulcers and terrified
Softies at open mics, fake lights, fake mics
Real sweat, Burger King refills and dollar meal rodeo scratch
Drip, catch the ripple effect illusion creepy
Out of place, premeditated nightmare damn skippy
With a fold-out patio chair in sin city
Catch a buzz like any self-respecting cult member does
MCs are just lunatics who pretend to count bars
Grimy, bite pussy, spit bars
Slit wrist watching Wizard of Oz
Cynic

[Hook: LoDeck & Despot]
Underground hip-hop! (yay)
This beat is dope! (it’s okay)
I’m ill! (I got nothin’ to say)
First name ain’t really lyrical
I’m a cynical bastard
Lo’ from j23

[Verse 2: Despot]
I’m living proof that the smallest figures
Can cast vast shadows of doubt
Giving your all to everything, and that’ll amount to nothing
I walk the crooked path up to my house
Huffing and puffing
Shaking my fist in the air, thinkin’ of something
To tell kids down the block that point and laugh at my mumbling
Like they’ll never reach their dreams
Gray-haired, sayin’ “that’s life,” it ain’t a sitcom theme
It’s more like ten people jammed in a closet yellin’
There’s poison in that lemonade the neighbor’s kids are selling
He writes your name on greeting cards and purposely misspells it
Keep depending on the kindness of strangers
Their lives suck, and you’re the perfect candidate for blaming
Maimin’ ego, that’s how the happy family feeds
The glass slipper broke and the foot’s starting to bleed
Fat skipper floats past the sleeping scuba team
Screams “I’m dying!”
One yells back “We’re tired!”
Swim towards the light, grab hold of something spiritual
Open your arms wide and hope to embrace a miracle
And catch death, then curse life for gettin’ rid of you
I’m cynical

[Hook: LoDeck & Despot]
Underground hip-hop! (yay)
This beat is dope! (it’s okay)

What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you

Yeah, the one next to the girl with no shoes on
That's so ratchet
That girl is such a fake model
She definitely bought all her Instagram followers
Who goes out on Mondays?
Okay, let's go take some shots
Oh no, ugh, I feel like I'm gonna throw up
Oh wait, never mind, I'm fine
Let's go dance
There's no vodka at this table
Do you know anyone else here?
Oh my God, Jason just texted me
Should I go home with him?
I guess I took a good selfie

[Verse 1]
Take a moment for yourself
Get close with the lights down low
You and I and no one else
I get the feeling that I wanna explode
Baby you grab my attention
Tension burning, fever high
Take me to another dimension
Tonight the rules do not apply

[Hook]
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive
I can't stop this feeling baby

When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive

This is where I wanna be
Hands up, feel the bass in my heart
Give me faith and I will leap
I take the risk cause you're never too far
Right now I'm drowning in emotion
Caution flies right out the door
Baby you're pushing this devotion
I can only ask for more

[Hook]
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive

[Intro]
A little bit of misfit banter
A little bit of jojo dancing
A little bit of thoughts of mine coming out the mind of this midnight rambler

[Verse 1]
I can't wait til these tunes of mine get me out of this local jam
Get up up on that big stage now
Show the world just who the heck I am
Ever think if it all goes right
You got something that could change your life
Use that moment just to show your life
Everything is gonna be alright....

[Pre-Chorus]
Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are
Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
They say if you look around for something hard enough and you just might find it
And there's some around who wanna keep you down but Shawty don't be blinded
Feeling trapped, thinking that you can't get out of this humdrum scene
Time to turn this thing upside down
Show these people what you really mean
Everything that you could lose your mind
Could it be the big dream you'll find
No more waiting cuz it's almost time
Everything is gonna be alright....

[Pre-Chorus]
Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are
Cause that's just the way we are
I'm crashing through the dark, we're alright
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hope I feel this forever
Or even if it's just tonight
I can see the end much clearer
Even when I close my eyes
Tryna keep myself from falling
Tryna get this thing right
I gotta do this more often
Well, well maybe tonight

[Chorus]
Crashing through the stars, alright
I'm screaming til the stars collide
I'm tellin everybody, that's right
We all got the spark, we all got the spark tonight
Takin back the way we are

Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

[Pre-Chorus: Avicii+Robbie Williams]
Heartache, heartbreaks all over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
(Oh whoa oh)

[Chorus 1: Avicii+Robbie Williams]
These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more
Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door
And the world is calling us but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

[Verse 2: Avicii+Robbie Williams]
Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of

Time flew, cut through all over town
You made me bleed when I look up and you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together

Neither of us knows what's in store
You just roll your window down and place your bets
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we'll never forget

And these are the days (these are the days)

Glass on the side

For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know

Before the beat kicks in again

I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous, if anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money, dazed and kinda lonely

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze, trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Pick up daddies at the playground, how I spend my daytime
Loosen up the frown, make them feel alive
Make it fast and greasy, I'm numb and way too easy

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze, trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Staying in my play pretend where the fun, it got no end, ohh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain, ohh
Staying in my play pretend where the fun, it got no end, oh-oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
And ooh, I lost the feeling but I'm tryin'a hold on
I thought the end of love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore!

When there's no getting through, I won't hold back
I will throw down everything in life, I know now
I've been laying on the floor, sweeping on the ground
I would give up everything in life, I'd know how!

'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up, I'd look up to the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you
Give it to you!

Ooh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shining bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
Visions in my mind about to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down, the other way around
I don't want the words 'til I can't make a sound

'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up, I'd look up into the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you
Give it to you!

Can't hold back, reaching out
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
Between us, I told you that
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it to you, give it to you!

I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you
Give it to you!

I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you
Give it to you!

No hay un detalle que a mí se me escape de tu cuerpo
Y cuando te pones hablar
Mi mente está imaginándome el momento, el lugar
Perdóname si te molesto, o si te sueno muy directo

From Las Vegas to right here
Under your dresser
Right by your ear
It's creeping in sweetly
It's definitely here
There's nothing more deadly
Than slow growing fear

And you could take a real bite
The juice poring well over
Your skins delight

And takes the depth away
Leaving broken down pieces
To this priceless ballet

You’re overprotective when I'm leavin'
Tryna compromise, but I can’t win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preachin'
You had me from the start, won't let this end

I used to be so happy but without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go

It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know

I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you

I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side

So what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind?

I don’t wanna try

[Verse 1]
I came here with a broken heart that no one else could see
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
But wounds heal when tears dry and cracks they don't show
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually
I never knew where I belonged
But I was right and you were wrong
Been telling myself all along

[Chorus]
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

[Verse 2]
I'm standin' on top of the world, right where I wanna be
So how can this dark cloud keep raining over me?
But hearts break and hell's a place that everyone knows
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go back to simplicity
I feel like I've been missing me
Was not who I'm supposed to be
I felt this darkness over me
We all get there eventually

Been telling myself all along

So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, I
I learned to wave goodbye
How not to see my life
Through someone else's eyes
It's not an easy road
But now I'm not alone
So I, I won't be so hard on myself no more

[Chorus]
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Everyone trips, everyone falls
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own

Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone

I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat

With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart you can't shame me

But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help

I was bound, was tied
Hadn’t seen the light so long
Thought I lost my fight
Couldn’t find my way back home
And I found the light stepping out of me
I was bound, and tied
Waiting for daylight and I…

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Bang my head against the wall
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I feel light headed
I should have failed, and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all

Bang my head against the wall

(ZooVier, 1738)
I been climbing up the wall, going through it all, baby
It’s so hard to live your life when you gave it up, baby
For the fans and the cameras
Different places, adventures
And the stress that it brings, start to wonder if it’s worth it
I live life like it’s perfect
My children are smiling and that makes me happy
Cause how I was living, I swear it had me
Bouncing my head off the wall
I am too far up, I cannot fall
Having fun, I don’t know about y'all

Bang your head against the wall
You may feel light headed, but you won’t crawl, no, you won’t fall
You will rise above it all
You’ll find what you’re searching for
And you may feel light headed
You think you’re gonna hit the floor
Instead you rise above it all

[Verse 1]
Died last night in my dreams
Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there was no answer

[Chorus]
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

[Verse 2]
Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected
Now, I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight, Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire

[Chorus]
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Ooh, my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

[Bridge]
There's no one left in the world
I'm gunslingin'
Don't give a fuck if I go
Down, down, down
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing
Oh, my heart is a ghost town

Ooh, my heart is a ghost town
Oh, my heart is a ghost town

My heart is a ghost town

Ayer me besaste y no podías parar
Y me bailaste hasta el amanecer
Cuando desperté yo te quise llamar
Y ahora me dice que borró cassette

Que no se acuerda de esa noche
Porque ella borró cassette
Dice que no me conoce
Y quiero volverla a ver

Y que los tragos, hicieron estrago' en su cabeza
Ella con cualquiera no se besa
Quiero que sepa que me interesa
Y no hay un día que no pare de pensar en su belleza

Quiero que sepa que me interesa
Y no hay un día que no pare de pensar en su belleza

Y cuando te emborrache' pa' mi casa nos vamos
Me sorprendió cuando sacaste ese cigarro
Tomaste tanto que lo has olvidado

Y tranquila ma', no pasa na'
Enloqueciste pero más na'
Pedías a grito que te besara
En la escalera y en el sofá
Y tranquila ma', no pasa na'
Conozco ya tu debilidad
Bastará solo un par de copas
Pa' conocerte en la intimidad

Cómo mi cuerpo te calienta
Ven, dímelo en la cara y no mientas

There’s a notebook on the table
You can take it to the store
So you won’t forget the groceries anymore
There’s a rifle in the cabinet that I used to fight a war
But to this day, I don’t know what I was fighting for
I’m fighting for

[Chorus]
Will you show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet
After 30 years of service and the wounds of it are me
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need

[Verse 2]
There’s a blanket on the sofa that I used to keep you warm
When I find you fast asleep at half past four
There’s a record we keep turning that reminds us of our youth
But there’s still nothing as beautiful as you

[Chorus]
Will you show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet
After 30 years of service and the wounds of it are me
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need

As we grow colder
Love provide the heat
Older bones are missing
Hearts will never meet
Because your hand belongs in my hand
Belongs in your hand, belongs with, with me

There’s a record we keep turning that I used to turn you on)

Show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet

Show me love as we grow colder

Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Whitney Alford]
Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
We want the funk
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?
We want the funk
Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?

[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

We're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

There's a hope that's waiting for you

We're stars and we're beautiful

All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (Daily struggle)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anne-Marie & Sean Paul]
She tells him, ""Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love.""
""I'm gonna give you all of my love.""

And no, mama, you never shed tear
'Cause you have to shed things year after year (Na, na, na, na)
And you give the yout love beyond compare (Yeah!)

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

You got a fast car

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me

Why I can't move on

Might want me to come show up at your door

Find table spaces
Say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are selling
There are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now, we'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs
To those who say we can't sit there, we're fine all by ourselves

[Pre-Chorus: Alessia Cara]
So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistaking, we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being

Find me where the wild things are

So don't get it mixed up
It's been, my story's never switched up
And I never kissed up
So fuck the world then I got my dick sucked
Try and say I'm too wild
Did my own thing so fuck the cool crowd
Late nights with the music too loud
I made it this far, now ma's just too proud
So if you don't like me
Cause I'm an asshole, well fuck, I might be
I was raised in the land of hyphy
World looked different as far as I see
I'm doing me, don't mind me
Only one time, I'mma tell you kindly
Please fuck off, I don't need you by me
But if you search then you know where to find me

[Verse 3: Alessia Cara]
I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me, they're not cooler than we are

So aye, we brought our drum and this is how we dance

Vivíamos en una fantasía, pero era real (De verdad)

Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it—tell me now, isn't it funny?

[Hook: Bebe Rexha & (G-Eazy)]
Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

[Post-Hook: Bebe Rexha & (G-Eazy)]
I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive
I don't need anything to make me satisfied
‘Cause the music fills me good
And it gets me every time

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha & (G-Eazy)]

‘Cause the music fills me good
And it gets me every time

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yeah, lonely nights I laid awake
Pray to Lord my soul to take
My heart's become too cold to break
Know I'm great, but I'm broke as hell
Havin' dreams that I'm foldin' cake
All my life I've been told to wait
But I'ma get it now, yeah, it's no debate
Yeah

[Hook: Bebe Rexha & (G-Eazy)]
Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life
(Got me for life, yeah)
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

[Post-Hook: Bebe Rexha & (G-Eazy)]
I don't need anything to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
And it's keepin' me alive (Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (You know)
‘Cause the music fills me good
And it gets me every time

[Verse 1]
You were the shadow to my light, did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight, wanna see us
Alight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

[Chorus]
Where are you now?
Where are you now? Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

[Post-Chorus]
I'm faded

[Verse 2]
These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea, I'm breathing
Alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me

Ven, te cuento de una vez
Tu descanso está en la cama de mis pies
Ven, te cuento un, dos, tres
Mis pasitos son descalzos, sin estrés

[Pre-Estribillo: Ricky Martin]
Dime si hay otro lugar
Para dejar mi corazón (Mi corazón)
Ay, tienes razón
Mejor, ¿por qué no nos vamos los dos?

[Estribillo: Ricky Martin]
Si tú quieres nos bañamos
Si tú quieres nos soplamos
Pa' secarnos lo moja'o
Si tu boca quiere beso
Y tu cuerpo quiere de eso, arreglamos
Si tú quieres un atajo y lo quieres por abajo
Yo te llevo bien calla'o
Vente pa'cá, vente pa'cá, vente pa'cá, ah-auh

[Verso 2: Ricky Martin]
Enamorados, qué calor
Nos comimos boca a boca en el sillón
Fue por hambre, fue por sed (Fue por sed)
Me bebiste a fondo blanco con tu piel

Dime si hay otro lugar
Para dejar mi corazón (Mi corazón)
Ay, tienes razón
Mejor, ¿por qué no nos vamos los dos?

(All right, too right, baby)
(Pretty Boy, Dirty Boy, baby)
Como me baila y me seduce
Y cuando le apagan la' luce'
Ella se luce y yo se lo hago otra vez (Otra vez)
Eh-yeh
Llevo tanto tiempo mirando reaccionar (Jajaja)
Dime qué estás esperando baby, no hay demora
Pégate a mí, bien rico a mí
No dejes que pasen las horas (Uh-uh-uh)
Tu booty me arrebata, tu sonrisa me atrapa
Quiero tenerte siempre y no dejarte sola
Esta historia no se acaba, ven, vamo' pa' mi cama
Esta noche tú te enamora'
Dime de una vez si es que al lado tuyo yo estaré
Todo lo que pida' te daré (Jajaja)
Esta noche tú te enamora'

We were young, you took my breath and
Filled your lungs up

I need rescuing
You're walking on thin ice

I'm alright tonight, live your life
You can keep that piece of me
I've come through, I'll prove, don't need you
It ain't how it used to be
You lost out, and now I've found
That I don't need that piece of me I've lost

(You can keep that piece of me, yeah)

Falling into emptiness
I've forgotten my mind
Faithless tears that I cried
I lost my whole life
Everything to live for now

Down the streets right through the city

Blow the smoke right through the window”

So far... from the stars

Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you

Letra de ""Andas En Mi Cabeza"" ft. Daddy Yankee

[Intro: Nacho]
Me delata la mirada
Hacerme el tonto, ¿para qué?
Si a mí no me importa nada
Prefiero vivir y perder que no haber vivido nada
Si te vas, quedaré en un dolor que jamás conocí

[Pre-Coro: Nacho]
Como arena en el viento
Sin brújula, sin dirección, pisado y sediento
Lo mismo que amar un humano sin alma en el cuerpo
Si te vas, quedaré en un dolor que jamás conocí

[Coro: Nacho, Chino & Daddy Yankee]
Andas en mi cabeza, nena, a todas horas
No sé cómo explicarte, eh
El mundo me da vueltas, tú me descontrolas
No paro de pensarte, eh
Por ti me la paso imaginando que, imaginando que
Contigo me casé, oye
Y por siempre te amé
Love you, girl, girl, girl, lo-lo-love you
Andas en mi cabeza, nena, a todas horas
Cada segundo, cada minuto
El mundo me da vueltas, tú me descontrolas (Yeah)
Cada segundo, cada minuto
Por ti me la paso imaginando que
Imaginando que
Contigo me casé, oye
Y por siempre te amé

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
(We ready ya)
Imagínate que tú conoce' lo que desconoce' (Yep; yep)
Yo me convierto en lobo después de las 12 (Yep)
Si no tuviera mi loba pa' que la descoce (Yep)
Me voy con la manada pa' que me destroce
Porque en la calle hay mucha compe', eh, eh
Siempre lo bueno se corrompe, eh, eh
Pero no quiero otra mujer aprovechándose (Yep)
Cuando tú eres la que me encanta (Ey)
Chica, nunca yo me atrevería a dejarte sola (Yep)
Chiqui-chiqui-chiqui-chiquitica nunca sola
Por ti yo guardé mi pistola
Las gaticas no me controlan
Tas' dudando, yo lo sé
Pero me quiere' a la vez (Eh)
Sólo pide que te dé, my love
Que te dé, my love, que te dé

[Puente: Chino & Daddy Yankee]
Si tú te vas
Se muere el amor
El que tú me das
Y llega el dolor
Seré un vagabundo
Solo en este mundo
Sin rumbo

Convertida en poesía, bebé

[Verse 1]
I thought I would know better
That's wishful thinking
Thought there'd be no pressure
That's wishful drinking
Is anything forever, or just a feeling?
What have I been so afraid of?
I don't know

[Verse 2]
From Brooklyn to New York, then off to the West
In Cali, no Khaled, but we the best
My stripes, stay American, let me express
And I keep it as live as a Total Request
And they ask me these questions
Like, ""How do you do it?
Press and the road and the music""
Truth is, I'm always up, I'm always down
Worry 'bout everyone else

[Chorus]
But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, yeah, I feel good
I feel good (good, good, good, yeah) I feel good

[Verse 3]
I live life like my blood type, B positive
These days, something got me feeling quite the opposite
Music like my heroin, but I all I hear is poppy hits
Time to get up off of it and watch somebody copy it
I'm West bound down and out
Feeling fake now like somebody found me out
Need to slow down, I'm browning out
So many thoughts, let me drown 'em out

[Verse 1]
I thought I would know better
That's wishful thinking
Thought there'd be no pressure
That's wishful drinking
Is anything forever, or just a feeling?
What have I been so afraid of?
I don't know

[Chorus]
But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, (good, good, good, yeah) I feel good

[Verse 4]
I've been looking at where we're going
There's no slowing down to go back
And thinking of where we've been
No one's ever been given a road map
Say, ""slow down, turn here, graduate and work here
Come and get a raise when you finish up your first year""
No, if you're doing it, you're doing it right
Keep it moving, now, tell me what you're doing tonight
Cause sometimes we're up, sometimes we're down
Don't worry about anyone else

[Chorus]
But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, yeah, I feel good
I feel good, (good, good, good, yeah) I feel good
I just wanna dance
I feel good

I know that you want me, so why'd you turn away?
Think of the perfect sex you and I can make
You tell me you're a good girl, baby I don't mind
Porque sé que sueñas con poderme ver
Mujer que vas a hacer
Decídete pa' ver
Si te quedas o te vas
Si no, no me busques más

Si te vas, you know I'm gonna go
Si me das, I'll take you on the low
Mi Amor, bailamos hasta la diez
Hasta que duelan los pies
Si te vas, you know I'm gonna go
Si me das, I'll take you on the low
Mi Amor, I want you all to myself
I'll love you like no one else

Con el te duele el corazón
Y conmigo te duelen los pies

In the night I wake up, wonder where you are
Thinking about your touch, dreamin' in the dark
He don't take me dancin', not the way you do
I'm out of my mind for you, cause you're in my head
In every drop of sweat you know I can't forget
I want you when I'm alone, I guess it's time to let you know

Girl don't even think about it, you'll never find another like me
No comparison to a brother like me

Satisfaction you want, girl, you'll get it from a yard man
So a me you fi call on, gi you the real blueprint

In the faded light you touch my body
I can feel your hands on my skin
Think you got me right where you want me
But you're just in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
I came to party on my own
Don't need nobody in my zone
I get down to the beat, I lose control
Eh-oh, I go so-, solo

[Chorus]
Boy, you can cool it down
Not here to fool around
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
I know you want me
But I don't care, baby
Just wanna dance, dance, dance

Just wanna dance, dance, dance

In the shade of night, you're moving closer
We're on our way to cross a line
Think you got me right where you want me
But it's all in your mind

I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah

And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I’ve been shaking
I love it when you go crazy

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions

’Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we’d be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
’Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark

And now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch

I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same, and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Verse 1]
Some kind of magic that lies underneath
Could have been tragic but we found the peace
Up to the mountains and under the sheets we go, we go
Work hard and sleep less and wait for the dream
No time to regret what we haven’t seen
Let downs and freak outs and storms clouds and us below
We made it out, made it out

[Pre-Chorus]
Good life with a couple bad times
A million mistakes, but we made it out fine
This life, yeah, it always finds a way

[Chorus]
To lead us to these heights
To lead us to these heights

[Verse 2]
No explanations for coming this far
The things turned around when I turned on my heart
I’ll thank the sun when he heals all my scars for good, for good
Thought it was impossible, but we always find a way
Of lookin' out, lookin' out
Over these heights that we never thought we’d say
We made it out, made it out

[Pre-Chorus]
Good life with a couple bad times
A million mistakes, but we made it out fine
This life, yeah, it always finds a way

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
Galway Girl, you're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
Galway Girl, you're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah

My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

Sube, sube)

Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

We were lovers for the first time
Running all the red lights
The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah
We were sipping on emotions
Smoking and inhaling every moment
It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah

We were high and we were sober
We were on and we were over
We were young and now I'm older
But I'd do it all again

[Verso 1: Maluma]
Cuando estás bien te alejas de mí
Te sientes sola y siempre estoy ahí
Es una guerra de toma y dame
Pues dame de eso que tienes ahí
Oye, baby, no seas mala
No me dejes con las ganas
Se escucha en la calle
Que ya no me quieres
Ven y dímelo en la cara

[Pre-Coro: Shakira & Maluma]
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti
Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo un egoísta

[Coro: Shakira, Maluma & Ambos]
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quiera
Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire
No soy de ti ni de nadie

[Verso 2: Shakira & Maluma]
Como tú me tientas, cuando tú te mueves
Esos movimientos sexys, siempre me entretienen
Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas
No sé por qué me tienes en lista de espera
Te dicen por ahí que voy haciendo y deshaciendo
Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ahí sufriendo
Que en esta relación soy yo la que manda
No pares bola' a toda esa mala propaganda

[Puente: Shakira & Maluma]
Pa', pa' que te digo na', te comen el oído
No vaya a enderezar lo que no se ha torcido
Y como un loco sigo tras de ti, muriendo por ti
Dime qué hay pa' mí, bebé (¿Qué?)

[Pre-Coro: Shakira & Maluma]
Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así

Need you on the other side

I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper

Driving at 90 down those country lanes

You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck, with you, and that's that

[Chrous]
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
When it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine (fine, fine, fine)

[Verse 2]
Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I tried staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope, but I still can't let you go

[Chorus]
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
When it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine (Fine, fine, fine)

[Outro]
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I'll be fine, fine, fine

Woah-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Woah-oh, oh, oh

[Verso 1: Becky G]
A mí me gusta que me traten como dama
Aunque a veces se me olvide cuando estamos en la cama
A mí me gusta que me digan poesía
Al oído por la noche cuando hacemos groserías

[Pre-Coro: Becky G]
Me gusta un caballero, que sea interesante
Que sea un buen amigo pero más un buen amante
¿Qué importan unos años de más?

[Coro: Becky G]
A mí me gustan mayores
De esos que llaman señores
De los que te abren la puerta y te mandan flores
A mí me gustan más grandes
Que no me quepa en la boca
Los besos que quiera darme y que me vuelva loca

[Post-Coro: Becky G]
Loca, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Loca, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]
Yo no soy viejo pero tengo la cuenta como uno
Si quiere' a la cama yo te llevo el desayuno
Como yo ninguno, un caballero con veintiuno (Yeh)
Yo estoy puesto pa' to' tu' locuras
Que tú quiere' un viejo, ¿'tás segura? (Wuh)
Yo te prometo un millón de aventura'
Y en la cama te duro lo que él no dura
Yo estoy activo 24/7
Conmigo no hacen falta lo' juguete'
Yo todavía nuevo de paquete
Pero si te gustan usa'o pues con otro vete

[Coro: Becky G]
A mí me gustan mayores

And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

Before, all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me
And every melody is timeless
Life was stringin' me along
Then you came and you cut me loose
Was solo, singin' on my own
Now I can’t find the key without you

And now your song is on repeat
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete
So, if you want the truth...

I just wanna be part of your symphony
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
Symphony
Like a love song on the radio
Will you hold, hold me, me, hold me, me
Hold me, me, hold me, me hold me, me, hold me, me
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

Will you hold, hold me, me, hold me, me

I’m sorry if it’s all too much
Every day you’re here, I’m healin'

Before all I heard was silence
A rhapsody for you and me

[Letra de ""La Bicicleta""]

[Verso 1: Carlos Vives]
Nada voy a hacer
Rebuscando en las heridas del pasado
No voy a perder
Yo no quiero ser un tipo de otro lado

[Pre-Coro: Shakira y Carlos Vives]
A tu manera, descomplicado
En una bici que te lleve a todos lados
Un vallenato desesperado

[Coro: Unidos]
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escribí
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto
Que hace rato esta mi corazón latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti
La que yo guardo donde te escribí
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto
Que hace rato está mi corazón latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

[Verso 2: Shakira]
Puedo ser feliz
Caminando relajada entre la gente
Yo te quiero así
Y me gustas porque eres diferente

[Pre-Coro 2: Carlos Vives]
A mi manera, despelucado
En una bici que me lleva a todos lados
Un vallenato desesperado

[Coro: Unidos]
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escribí
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto
Que hace rato está mi corazón latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti
La que yo guardo donde te escribí
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto
Que hace rato está mi corazón latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

[Puente: Carlos Vives y Shakira]
Ella es la favorita, la que canta la zona
Se mueve sus caderas como un barco en las olas
Tiene los pies descalzos como un niño que adora
Y su cabello largo son un sol que te antoja
Le gusta que le digan que la niña, la lola
Le gusta que la miren cuando ella baila sola
Le gusta más la casa que no pasen las horas
Le gusta Barranquilla, le gusta Barcelona
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta
Óyeme, Carlos, llévame en tu bicicleta
Quiero que recorramos juntos esa Zona
Desde Santa Marta hasta La Arenosa
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta
Pa' que juguemos bola e'trapo allá chancleta
Que si a Pique algún día le muestras el Tayrona
Después no querrá irse pa' Barcelona

[Pre-Coro: Unidos]
A mi manera, descomplicado
En una bici que me lleva a todos lados
Un vallenato desesperado

[Coro: Unidos]
Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escribí
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto
De hace rato está mi corazón latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti
La que yo guardo donde te escribí
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto
Que hace rato está mi corazón latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti

[Final: Shakira]
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta
Óyeme, Carlos, llévame en tu bicicleta
Que si a Pique algún día le muestras el Tayrona
Después no querrá irse pa' Barcelona
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta
Óyeme, Carlos, llévame en tu bicicleta
Que si a mi Piqué tú le muestres el Tayrona
Después no querrá irse pa' Barcelona

[Verse 1: Jack]
""No thank you"" is what I should've said
I should be in bed
But temptations of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come

[Pre-Chorus: Jack]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And ""no thank you"" is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

[Chorus: All]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
But I'm weak, ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
But I'm weak

[Verse 2]
No thank you
They call me after dark, I don't want no part
My habits, they hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge

[Pre-Chorus: Jack]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And ""no thank you"" is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

[Chorus: All]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that

[Verse 1]
I got these fresh eyes, never seen you before like this
My God, you're beautiful
It's like the first time
When we opened the door 'fore we got used to usual

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It might seem superficial
Stereotypical, man
You dress up just a little and I'm like, ""Oh, damn""

[Chorus]
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes

[Verse 2]
Appreciation, well, it comes and it goes
But I, I'll ride that wave with you
It's human nature to miss what's under your nose
'Til you, 'til you remind a fool

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe all of this is simple
My heart's unconditional, yeah
You dress up just a little and I'm like, ""Oh, damn""

[Chorus]
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes

[Bridge]
If I could bottle this up, bottle, bottle this up, I would
I would bottle this up, bottle, bottle this up, I would
'Cause you're gorgeous in this moment
If I could bottle this up, I would

[Chorus]
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine
Now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes
So suddenly, I'm in love with a stranger
I can't believe that she's mine, yeah
And now all I see is you with fresh eyes, fresh eyes

[Verse 1]
I often tell myself that we could be more than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon it will all end
I live in misery when you're not around
I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go

[Verse 2]
I often fantasize the stars above are watching
They know my heart, it speaks to yours like only lovers do
If I could wear your clothes I'd pretend I was you
And lose control

[Bridge 1]
There'll be some love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin' love
Love makin', heart breakin', soul shakin'

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
(Hold me tight and don't let go)

[Bridge 2]
Runnin' in and outta life
Has got me so confused
We gotta make a sacrifice
Somebody's gotta choose
We can make it if we try
For the sake of you and I
Together we can make it right

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
Hold me tight and don't let go
What's it gonna be?

Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 1]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

Leave it with a baby sitter
Mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh until it falls won't bother me

Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

That you could fall in love at the first sight

I put it in my wallet
Hoping I'd see your face again

Captured the look in your eyes
It's only a matter of time
Before it starts fading

Remember the words you told me
""Love me 'til the day I die""

Takes one to know one, yeah
You beat me at my own damn game

Lately our conversations
End like it's the last goodbye

Nobody could take my place
When you’re looking at those strangers
Hope to God you see my face

Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while
I start texting
Write a paragraph
But then I delete the message
Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool
To remind who we are
And that we are not alone
And we're walking in the dark

[Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days
All our troubles, we'll lay to rest and

Give it to you

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

Wide awake and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
I don't know what I'd do
Ooh, baby
If you only saw a friend in me
I’d be bittersweet

You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you’ve been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I’ll give you electricity
Give it to you

And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know

I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

[Refrain]
And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Where we're united under our indifference

And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you

[Pre-Coro]
Cuando yo la vi
Dije, ""Si esa mujer fuera para mí""
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

[Coro]
'Tás dura, dura
Dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien
'Tás dura, mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel
'Tás dura, dímelo, dímelo, ¿cómo es que e'?
'Tás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
'Tás dura, dura, dura

[Verso 1]
Tú eres la máquina, la máquina de baile
Si no tiene' a nadie vente pa' mi' brazos, caile
Ese perfume se siente en el aire
Algo como Argentina, tú me traes los Buenos Aires
'Tá poderosa, media escandalosa
Habrán muchas mujeres pero tú eres otra cosa
Si fuera un delito eso de que estás hermosa
Te arresto en mi cama y te pongo las esposas
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Miren el material, edición especial
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

[Coro]
'Tás dura, dura
Dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien
'Tás dura, mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel
'Tás dura, dímelo, dímelo, ¿cómo es que e'?
'Tás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
'Tás dura, dura, dura

[Puente]
Me gusta como mueve ese ram-pam-pam
Mi mente maquineando en un plan-plan-plan
Si me deja, en esa curva le doy pam-pam
Cuál es tu receta no sé, 'tás pa' comerte bien
Me gusta como mueve ese ram-pam-pam
Mi mente maquineando en un plan-plan-plan
Si me deja, en esa curva le doy pam-pam
Tu belleza retumba, las otras pa' la tumba

[Verso 2]
Uno, dos y tres, vamo' a darle, la envidia que se calle
Saludos a to'as las nenas que paralizan la calle
¿Cómo tú te llamas? ¿de dónde tú eres?
Dame el número pa' entrar contigo en detalles
Y tienes el toque, toque, toque
Pareces una estrella formando el alboroto
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Se cae el internet cuando subes una foto

[Pre-Coro]
Cuando yo la vi (Dímelo, baby girl)
Dije: ""Si esa mujer fuera para mí"" (Pa' mí esa baby)
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

[Coro]
'Tás dura, dura
Dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien
'Tás dura, mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel

I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I'll lay out all my reasons, you'll say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like
And I say yeah-eah

[Verse 2]
I'll tell them a story, they'll sit and nod their heads
I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you said (stand by what you said)

La Z y la L
Si hasta la luz se apaga sola
Péguese, dale, baile ahora
Pa' soltarse un trago se toma

Y si decide quedarse conmigo
Ven para que seas tú misma la testigo
Esto es pa' que vea que aún no la olvido
Sólo una cosa te pido

Que si decide quedarse conmigo
Ven para que seas tú misma la testigo
Esto es pa' que vea que aún no la olvido
Sólo una cosa te pido

[Pre-Coro: Zion]
Y dime que te dan
Tu ma'i, tu pa'i en tu casa
Lo que hicieron fue una amenaza
Pa'lante no hay qué

Y péguese y comience (y)
Que yo no quiero que se me estrese

Ponte, vente, que en esto nunca pierdo
Viendo como con tu cuerpo conecto
Toma, disfrútalo, quémalo lento

Que si tú quiere', nos vemos cuando tú quiera (yeh)
Le cuelgas el teléfono temprano
No se da cuenta que va a dormir él sólo
Porque sola no te acuestas
Y no le digo na'
Algo le digo, pero me dijo que tarde lo ha pilla'o en una vuelta
No, no le digo na'
Me volvió a llamar
Uoh-uoh-yeh

If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taken
Since you left feels like a waste on me

That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over
Well, there must be something in the tide

I don't want another night of tryna find
Another you, another rock bottom
I don’t wanna wear another mini dress

I don't wanna spend the night at someone's place
To fill the space that you used to walk in
I don’t want another number in my phone
Someone to hold at 3 in the morning

I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah

And made you think that it was all your fault

You can't deny that we’re something different
And I know I’m going looking for your kiss
On someone's lips to know that I miss ya

All I need is roses

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment

Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily, I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?

All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

Promise me you'll catch me when I'm weightless
Hold me close before the crazy calm
Until you're done with running, I'll be patient
'Cause I know, I know you'll be there

[Pre-Chorus]
And I never had a plan for this
Everything is what it is
You never hold me back in anything
You didn't even have to try

Without your love, we go nowhere
With just one touch
You're always there to remind me
You take me there
When waters rough, you will still be there
Without your love
You're always there right beside me
We go nowhere
With just one touch, with just one touch

When the tide's all out and you're neglected
It's okay if your river's running dry
Flips 180 when you least expect it

I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

And you’re not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

There must be someone who's feeling for me

In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk the line and try to see
Falling behind in what could be, oh

Bring me a higher love (My love)

All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

Walked down, had me sittin' up
Demanded my attention, had to give it up
Look like somebody designed you
Drop-dead gorgeous, you make me wanna live it up
Your presence is critical
Movin' my soul, yeah, you're spiritual
They hate it when you notice me
Like everybody else invisible (Ooh)
Breakin' all the rules (Oh-oh)
So above the law (So above the law)
I'll be your excuse (Damn right)
Uh, and you won’t go wrong, no

You stick out of the crowd, baby, it's a no-brainer (No-brainer)
It ain't that hard to choose
Him or me, be for real, baby, it's a no-brainer

You got your mind unloose
Go hard and watch the sun rise (Rise)
One night'll change your whole life
Off top, drop-top, baby it's a no-brainer (Oh, no)
Put 'em up if you with me
Yeah, yeah-eah, yeah, yeah-eah-eah

[Letra de ""HP""]

[Intro]
Maluma, baby

[Coro]
Ella no está buscando novio
Quiere salir a joder, yeh-yeah
Quiere olvidarse de ese bobo
Porque el cabrón le fue infiel, oh-no-no-no

[Verso]
Le rompiero' el corazón y no busca a nadie que se lo reponga
Solo quiere a alguien que se lo ponga
Ella quiere un man que no la llame y que no joda
Pa' reemplazar al perro que no la valora
Quiere aprovechar que está más buena y más de moda
Empezó a meterle al gym desde que quedó sola
Las envidiosas dicen que eso se lo hizo el cirujano
Pero es ella misma queriendo salir del daño

[Pre-Coro]
Quiere salir, fumar, beber
Subir un video pa' que lo vea él
Pa' que se de cuenta de lo que perdió
Pa' que el hijuepu— se sienta peor
Quiere salir, fumar, beber
Subir un video pa' que lo vea él
Pa' que se de cuenta de lo que perdió
Pa' que el hijuepu— se sienta peor

[Coro]
Ella no está buscando novio (No busca novio, no)
Quiere salir a joder (Yeh-yeah)
Quiere olvidarse de ese bobo (Ey, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Porque el cabrón le fue infiel, oh-no-no-no

[Refrán]
Y cuando se suelta
No existe una amiguita que la pare
No quiere un novio pa' rendirle cuentas
No necesita ningún HP en el party que la pare
Y cuando se suelta
No existe una amiguita que la pare
No quiere un novio pa' rendirle cuentas
No necesita ningún HP en el party que la pare

[Pre-Coro]
Quiere salir, fumar, beber
Subir un video pa' que lo vea él
Pa' que se de cuenta de lo que perdió
Pa' que el hijuepu— se sienta peor
Quiere salir, fumar, beber
Subir un video pa' que lo vea él
Pa' que se de cuenta de lo que perdió
Pa' que el hijuepu— se sienta peor (Peor)

[Coro]
Ella no está buscando novio (No busca novio, no)
Quiere salir a joder (Yeh-yeah)
Quiere olvidarse de ese bobo (Ey, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Porque el cabrón le fue infiel, oh-no-no-no

Evita molestias y tu tiempo no pierdas
Conmigo no encuentras nada
A escondidas vives chequeando las fotos
Investigando mi perfil
No lo niegues, bien te conozco

Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 5-12)
(Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh; ¿me sigue'?)
Nunca se deja ver (Nunca se deja ver; ¡no!)
Lo sabe disimular (Lo sabe disimular)
Tiene lo suyo y le va bien
Pero de noche conmigo le gusta portarse mal (Wuh-huh!)
Llega y lo que quiere es pecar, eh (Ey)
Está puesta pa’ bellaquear, eh (La presión)
Yo no la paro, y a veces mira raro y (¡Rrra!)

[Coro: Jhay Cortez & Bad Bunny]
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce; no, no, no)
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 5-12 (Como la 5-12)

Un par de amiga' (Un par de amiga'; wuh-huh)
To’as solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga (Siga)

Me llama pa' que yo la pruebe y (Yah)
Cuando yo la toco, eso llueve ahí (-ve ahí)
Ella se vistió y yo la desvestí (Que sí)
Nunca dice: ""No"", siempre dice: ""Sí"" (Wuh)
Cuando quiere bailar, el dembow la azota (¿Qué?)
Ella se pone loca
Ella lo que quiere es peinarse (Wuh), y arreglarse (Wuh)
Llega a la disco a soltarse (Ah)
Que si me conoce, dice: ""No"", pero sabe bien que sí
Ella lo mezcla con alcohol, como cuando yo le di
En toda' las poses, preguntan y dice: ""No sé""
De contacto tiene ""José"", y siempre después de las 11 o 12

Tira pa' que yo la pruebe
Se pone olorosa y me gusta como huele (Como huele)
Instagram privado pa' que nadie la vele
Se puso bonita porque sabe que hoy se bebe
A portarse mal pa' sentirse bien (Bien)
No quería fumar pero le dio al pen (Sí)
Una Barbie, pero no busca un Ken (No)
Siempre le llego cuando dice: ""Ven""
Pa' portarse mal se viste bien (Bien)
Dice la verdad y a vece' miente también
Apaga las notificacione' en el cel
