Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?"" I say

[Chorus]
When I see your face (Face, face)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
And when you smile (Smile, smile)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
Yeah
[Verse 2]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say

[Chorus]
When I see your face (Face, face)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
And when you smile (Smile, smile)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)

[Post-Chorus]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

1,Love The Way You Lie,Recovery,Eminem,2010-06-18,263373,81,https://open.spotify.com/track/15JINEqzVMv3SvJTAXAKED,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
[Chorus: Rihanna & Eminem]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie289EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

[Verse 1]
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Heyy

Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

[Bridge]
The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me
[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night
[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes
[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Outro: B.o.B]
I could really use a wish right now
I, I, I could really use a wish right now

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love

You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look

You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'

Bottles, models, standin' on chairs
Ball out 'cause that's the business
All out, it's so ridiculous
Zone out, so much attention
Scream out, I'm in the building - hey!
They watchin', I know this
I'm rockin', I'm rollin'
I'm holdin', I know it, you know it
[Chorus: Flo Rida & Carmen Michelle Key]
You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out

Hey
Still feelin' myself, I'm like outta control
Can't stop now, more shots, let's go
Ten more rounds, can I get a K.O.?
Paparazzi tryna make me pose
Came to party 'til I can't no more
Celebrate 'cause that's all I know
Tip the groupies takin' off they clothes
Grand finale like Super Bowl
Go hard, I run the show
That's right, wild out, got money to blow
More lights, more ice, when I walk in the door
No hype, do it big all over the globe
Yeah! I said it, go tell it
Confetti, who ready?
I'm ready! You ready? Let's get it!
[Chorus: Flo Rida & Carmen Michelle Key]

Biraz yavaşlaması gerektiğini söylüyorlar

Yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos (Dimelo!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (Ayy, aha) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle (Yeah) where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Yeah) (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Aha, aha, aha) (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (New)
Big lights will inspire you (Come on) (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (You welcome, OG) (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh) (I made you hot, nigga)
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley
Labor Day Parade—rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo—I'm from the Empire State, that's
[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (Ayy) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien
[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (Ayy, ow) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (Okay)

One hand in the air for the big city (Oh)
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (Oh)
No place in the world that could compare (Nah)
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
""Yeah, yeah"" (Come on, come on)
""Yeah, yeah"" (Come on)

You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong

Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back

Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:
[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

[Chorus 2]
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)

You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Bridge]
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?
[Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seein' it in my dreams
I'm lookin' down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin'
Hittin' my head against the wall

What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Won't listen to any advice
Mama's tellin' me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time (All the time)

The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug?
Your drug
Huh, your drug
Huh, your drug
Is my love your drug?

And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring

Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe
[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

Come on, show 'em what you're worth

Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""

It's always been inside of you, you, you

Caution when it comes to love

And you were strong, and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot

You've gone and so effortlessly
You've won, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken

Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible

Falling for betrayal is worse

But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space

I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi

Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment
[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall
[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

Oh-oh, Oh-ho

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors

Back of the party, I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryin' to get bent and meet a thick redbone
She do her Dougie and all them bitches hatin'
But I'm about to escape with a bitch and head home
She got her friend so it's a two man and
I run it, run it even if her legs long
She like, you hubby
I think she love me
But I change the subject and I do my Dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove, Heff in the back with Playboy bunnies
We gonna make em do the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head the bitch looked at me funny
Duh, bitch you can't tell me nothin'
Starr made the beat, I just took it out the oven
I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans cause the burner keep rubbin'20EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and
Read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse, he's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap (Rap)
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

[Verse 1]
Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
A violence prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam

Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat

So we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say
[Chorus]
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

[Verse 2]
So many wars, settling scores
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
I heard them say 'love is the way'
'Love is the answer,' that's what they say

But look how they treat us, make us believers
We fight their battles, then they deceive us
Try to control us, they couldn't hold us
Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers

But we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering, when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that faithful day
It's not far away but for now we say

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, and then it goes
And then it goes

And everybody will be singing it
And you and I will be singing it
And we all will be singing it

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

Ooooh, New York!
Ooooh, New York!

[Verse 1]
Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seein' my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway

[Hook 1]
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!

[Verse 2]
On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a meltin' pot, on the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge
[Hook 2]
I'mma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!

[Bridge]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
""Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah!""

[Hook 3]
In New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

[Chorus]
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

[Verse 2]
Te amo, te amo
She's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over

Watch me all night

To feel the love, but I don't feel that way

Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I’m on my way

[Tinie Tempah - Verse 1]
Let's go...
Yeah
You’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials

Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child
When they see me everybody brrrrraps, brrrrrraps
Son I’m like a young and fully black Barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack

I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to Earth
I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed

Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming until they hear you out

[Chorus]
Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Tinie Tempah - Verse 2]
Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never tipped cause we needed the change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying
I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray
They say money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed

Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man!

I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyones a kid that no one cares about
You just have to keep screaming until they hear you out

[Chorus]
Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young
[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Just let it run..
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of Young

[Intro]
Uh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it
[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 2]
Uh, one thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh
[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over

Ohh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say I love you enough?
Till it's to late, it's not too late

[Verse 2]
Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
[Verse 2]
And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
'Cause when we long for absolution
There'll no one on the line, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
Yeah, mmm
[Bridge]
You never know a good thing till it's gone
You never see a crash till it's head on
Why do we think we're right when we're dead wrong?
You never know a good thing till it's gone

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away

Keep drinkin' coffee, stare me down across the table
While I look outside
So many things I'd say, if only I were able
But I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by
You've got opinions, man, we're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked
So, let me thank you for your time
And try to not waste any more of mine
Get outta here fast

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to break it to you, babe
But I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save

Who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?
Oh
[Verse 2]
You sound so innocent, all full of good intent
Swear you know best
But you expect me to jump up on board with you
And ride off into your delusional sunset
I'm not the one who's lost with no direction, oh
But you'll never see
You're so busy makin' maps with my name on them in all caps
You got the talkin' down, just not the listening

And who cares if you disagree? You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

To make everybody happy while I

Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation

That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on

I’m 'bout to be a bigger star than my mum thought
‘Cause every day I got a groupie at my front door
Now I drive past the bus I used to run for
Where’s my fucking clap, where’s my encore?
I walk alone, ‘cause I was born alone
I chirps her just for fun, I never ever call her phone
I leave her in the club, I never ever walk her home
DL the fucking foundation, I'm the cornerstone
I’m born famous, I’m sort of known
And if your son doesn’t, I bet your daughter knows
Check out my visual, check out my audio
Extra ordinary, yo, hope you enjoyed the show
[Hook: Tinie Tempah & Labrinth]
Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

[Bridge: Labrinth & Tinie Tempah]
Woah
Wooooooooo-oah
Woah
Wooooooooo-oah

Look at me I've been a cheeky bastard, man and
Look at all the drama we started, now I’m
In here laying on my back
Saying, ""DJ won't you give me one more track?""

I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning

[Hook: Labrinth & Tinie Tempah]
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

In a few weeks, I will get time
To realise it's right before my eyes
And I can take it if it's what I want to do
I am leaving and this is starting
To feel like it's right before my eyes
And I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning

And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

Maybe next year, I'll have no time
To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?
I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you
Could have obtained, why try anything?
I will get there; just remember, I know

[Intro]
Kane is in the building
[Verse 1: Drake]
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse

Standing on the edge of forever
At the start of whatever
Shouting love at the world
Back then we were like cavemen
But we map the moon and the stars
Then we forgave them

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We will meet you where the lights are
The defendants of the faith we are
When the thunder turns around they’ll run so hard we’ll tear the ground away

You know no one dies
In these love drowned eyes
Through our love drowned eyes
We’ll watch you sleep tonight

[Chorus 1]
Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood
Learning how to dance the rain
We were holding back the flood
They said we’d never dance again

[Verse 2]
Bleeding, but none of us leaving
Watch your mouth son
Or you’ll find yourself floating home
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Here we come now on a dark star
Seeing demons, not what we are
Tiny minds and eager hands will try to strike but now will end today

There’s progress now
Where there once was none
Where there once was none
Then everything came along

[Chorus 2]
Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood
Learning how to dance the rain
There was more of them than us
Now they’ll never dance again
Although no one understood
There was more of them than us
Learning how to dance the rain
We were holding back the flood
They said we’d never dance again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We will meet you where the lights are
The defendants of the faith we are
When the thunder turns around they’ll run so hard we’ll tear the ground away
[Chorus 3]
Although no one understood
There was more of them than us
Learning how to dance the rain
(Learning how to dance the rain)
There was more of them than us
Now they’ll never dance again
Now we’ll never dance again

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

But you played it with a beating

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""

Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
(You don't know, oh-oh,) You don't know you're beautiful

[Chorus: All, Harry & (Zayn)]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair (C'mon) gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground (Ground), it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Beautiful)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately (Desperately)
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe

Oh-oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now, here's another one
So your melody will play on and on
With the best of 'em
You are beautiful
Like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again
And I want you to know, baby

[Chorus]
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby (Oh)
And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

[Verse 2]
Constantly
Boy, you play through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me
What you do
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free
I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful
You are
And I want you to know, baby
[Chorus]
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby

And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

[Bridge]
No one compares
You stand alone to every record I own
Music to my heart, that's what you are
A song that goes on and on

[Chorus]
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you)

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa
[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again

[Verse 2]
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

Make my body say, ""Ah-ah-ah""
I like it, like it

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me

January first, oh, you like that gossip?
Like you the one drinking what God sip—dot com
Now I gotta word for your tongue
How many rolling stones you want?
Yeah I got a brand new spirit
Speaking it and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun

A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach

Diamond, platinum, no more for you
Got adrenaline, never giving in
Giving up's not an option, gotta get it in
Witness, I got the heart of 20 men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunning from the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates, take a genius to understand me

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face

I wish nothing but the best for you, too

Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

I was under your spell for such a long time
Couldn't break the chains
You played with my heart, tore me apart
With all your lies and games
It took all the strength I had
But I crawled up on my feet again
Now you're trying to lure me back
But no, those days are gone my friend
I loved you so much
That I thought someday that you could change
But all you brought me was a heart full of pain

And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

[Bridge]
Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

[Chorus]
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now96EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

[Verse 2]
To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there's to complain about
[Pre-Chorus]
When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You got to take it in

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh, a good, good life
Yeah
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Hopelessly, I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly, I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly, I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly, the hope is we have
So much to feel good about

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Good, good life
Good life
Ooh, ooh

This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I’m 6'8""
[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9""]
By the time you hear this, I’ll prolly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin’
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
‘Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be

Oh-oh, Oh-ho

[Verse 1]
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby

But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
[Pre-Bridge]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Bridge]
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

[Chorus]
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em

I can see, you're not yourself
Even when you're here, with me
I know that you're some, where else

[Pre-Chorus: Olly Murs]
So put another record on
Kiss and lead me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
'Cause every time we come this close, my heart skips, skips a beat

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

So, hung up
We can't, let go
If you really have, to leave
One more time just move, me slow

At the start of the night I was like, what? Let's have a team talk
Playing with this lady isn't something I'd agree for
Vibes keep going up and down like a see-saw
Should have just taken her to the cinema to see Saw
Ooh, she let me sleep with her, I figured her figure's a sure, sure winner
Plus I got a lead from the back, I'm a skipper
You make my heart skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip a beat (Skip a beat)

Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes (Thank you)

Tell the world that I'm coming home (Yeah, ayo, check this out)

“A House Is Not a Home,” I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone? (No)
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it (Come on)
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it (That's right)
But you felt it, and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it (Or conceal it)
But you deal with it (Deal with it)
And you keep ballin' (That's right)
Pour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' (Keep ballin')
Baby, we been living in sin
'Cause we been really in love, but we been living as friends (Yeah)
So you've been a guest in your own home (Come on)
It's time to make your house your home (Yeah)
Pick up your phone, come on (Pick up the phone)

And they've forgiven my mistakes (Thank you)
I'm coming home, I'm coming home (I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
Tell the world that I'm coming home (I'm almost home, check this out, yeah)

[Verse 3: Diddy, Kalenna Harper]
""Ain't No Stopping Us Now,"" I love that song
Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop (We won't stop)
Till we back cruisin' through Harlem, these old blocks (Yeah)
It's what made me (Uh huh), saved me, drove me crazy (Oh, oh)
Drove me away (Come on), then embraced me (Yeah, yeah)
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings (Let's go) (Oh yeah)
Welcome to my homecoming (Coming)
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)
But here I stand (Come on) (Here I stand)
A better man (Don't stop) (A better man)
Thank you, Lord! (Thank you, Lord!)
Thank you all!

Have you ever had the feelin' that you was bein' had?
Don't that shit there make you mad? They treat you like a slave
Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin' through they teeth, hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh (Ha ha) put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats, then get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold, don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Gon' and put your hands up, when times is hard, you stand up
L-U-P the man, 'cause the brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us, they'll never slow my plans up

Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me, boy
I hope your son don't have a gun and never be a d-boy

No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire

I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile

I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up

Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight

It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real

Ladies and gentlemen, this is something
They call a ground-breaker
So, let me first apologize to the shirts and the ties
For your make-up
Cause I'll make you ugly, as soon as it drops
We're on a rampage, bottles poppin' off
Before you know it, there's rubble and dust
Cause we'll be fuckin' it up
Somebody say 'You better run!'

[Hook: Labrinth]
Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, ""Yeah!""
I predict an earthquake up in here
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
Hey, yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here

What you're about to witness is no illusion
And now, we got the bass banging
From here to Buckingham Palace

Everybody rock, let's bring the house down
To rubble and dust cause we'll be fuckin' it up
Somebody say 'You better run!'

Without a match or lighter
Don't do girlfriends, one nighters

Doing all nighters, no days off
Gray hairs and a little bit of weight loss

Cut the music up
A little louder

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love
[Verse 2]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Bridge]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual
[Chorus]
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart

I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh

But still, I'll raise the flag

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I’m not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it, oh

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
Nothing to hide, stifle or smother
Suffered and cried, strife made me tougher
Never mumbled or shy to trouble I rise above all
Expectations forget rep
Ain’t never begged yet
When I wanted to get pence hustle
To be I am exactly what my neck says
That sket said I tried to cash in on my Dad's death
I wanted to vent but I never said fuck all
After all you were never kin to me
Family is something that you never been to me
In fact making it harder for me to see my father
Was the only thing that you ever did for me

(Dear Dad)
As a kid I looked up to you
Only thing was I never saw enough of you
The last thing I said to you was I hated you
I loved you and now it's too late to say to you
Just didn't know what to do and how to deal with it
Even now deep down I'm still livid
To think I used to blame me
I wonder what I did to you to make you hate me
I wasn't even 5, life's a journey and mine wasn't an easy ride
You never even got to see me rhyme
I just wish you woulda reached out
I wish you would have been round when I been down
I wish that you could see me now
Wherever you are I really hope you found peace
But know that if I ever have kids
Unlike you I'll never let them be without me

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I’m not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it, oh

(I write songs I can't listen to
Everything I have to give to you
And everyone of these lines I sing to you)
[Bridge: Professor Green]
My job's more like public service
My life just became yours to read and interpret
If you heard it and come across a lot different at times
I throw fits when I read how they word things
You see me smile
Now you're gonna have to see me hurting
Cause pretending everything is all right
When it ain't, really isn't working

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
[Verse 2]
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything! Money on my mind!""
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake"", girl don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys

""Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!""
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…

[Outro Poem]
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better176EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Pour a little salt, we were never here

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Verse 1]
And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-whoa
[Verse 2]
And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa (Shake him off)

[Bridge]
And it's hard to dance
With a devil on your back (Shake him off)
And given half the chance
Would I take any of it back? (Shake him off)
It's a fine romance
But it's left me so undone (Shake him off)
(Shake him off) It's always darkest before the dawn
Oh whoa
Oh whoa

[Breakdown]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me (Oh woah)
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me (Oh woah)
But, what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah
[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back

When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Verse 1]
Uh, black stripe, yellow paint
Them niggas scared of it, but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club, look at them hoes' face
Hit the pedal once, make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roarin'
It’s the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, I’m ballin' out on every level
Hear them haters talk, but there’s nothin' you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: ""That's nothin'!""

[Verse 2]
Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
And bitches love me ‘cause I'm fucking with their best friends
Not a lesbian, but she a freak though
This ain't for one night, I’m shining all week, ho
I’m sippin' Clicquot and rocking yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in my watch I can’t tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up, 'cause every nigga that I’m with Taylor'd

[Chorus]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: ""That's nothin'!""

Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
[Verse 3]
Stay high like how I’m supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds can’t get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean, but it's super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks
Get fly and take trips and that's that, real rap
I let her get high if she want and she feel that
Convertible drop feel, ‘87, the top peeled back

[Bridge]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
You already know what it is, man
And if you don't, you should by now

To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' ""don't go""

[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
[Verse 3]
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky

One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

They tell us everything's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night
When something's clearly wrong?
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same

The right thing to guide us
Is right here inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heartbeat
The drumbeat carries on
And the drumbeat carries on
Just like a heartbeat

It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time

You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow

Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you're sitting 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

The one

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone

I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And I realize the blame is on me

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

The day I first met you, you told me
You'd never fall in love
But now that I get you, I know fear is what it really was

Now here we are
So close, yet so far
Haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize, baby, I'm not like the rest?

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake

And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

On Sunday, you went home, alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love, but you did not reply

The world is ours if we want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand

But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run, whoa, whoa

Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong

And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break

I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away
Some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone (Sleepin' here alone)
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want (Do the things I want)

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'll come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
[Verse 2]
You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on and over you

[Pre-Chorus]
You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You tried to break me, but you see

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[Bridge]
Thanks to you, I got a new thing started
Thanks to you, I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
You know in the end, the day you left was just my beginning
In the end
[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

I was there to witness
Candice's inner business
She wants the boys to notice
Her rainbows and her ponies
She was educated
But could not count to ten
How she got lots of different horses
By lots of different men

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I say liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high but in the hole there's water
You can get some when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

[Chorus]
Hey, ho, here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey, ho, here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
Got a hurricane at back of her throat
She thinks she's made of candy
[Verse 2]
Ring a ring of roses
Whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes
As the war of the roses
Mother was a victim
Father beat the system
By moving bricks to Brixton
And learning how to fix them

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high but in the hole there's water
As you will, she'll be the whole of the law
And if it don't feel good
What are you doing it for
Now tell me

[Chorus]
Hey, ho, here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo

All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

I don't know if this makes sense, but, you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to it, I'll beat you there
Girl, you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we on top of the world (World) 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Man, we stepping out, like whoa (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot (Shoot)
Ask me, ""What's my best side?""
I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
As long as you love me (Yeah, yeah, baby)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum (Platinum), I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me (I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold)

But, baby, when you're done
You gotta be the first to run
Rule number two
Just don't get attached to
Somebody you could lose
So le-let me tell you

This is how to be a heartbreaker

Singin' I lo-lo-lo-love you

Wear your heart on your cheek
But never on your sleeve
Unless you want to taste defeat

Gotta be looking pure
Kiss him goodbye at the door
And leave him wanting more, more

Girls, we do, whatever it will take
Cause girls don't want
We don't want our hearts to break, in two
So it's better to be fake
Can't risk losing in love again, babe

This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get him falling for a stranger, a player
Singin' I lo-lo-lo-love you

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
[Verse 2]
On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause...

Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

Mmm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
[Verse 2]
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible

Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[Verse 3: Kimbra]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye & Kimbra]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ahhh)
And I don't even need your love (Oooh)
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (Ahhh)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Oooh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ahhh)
I guess that I don't need that though (Oooh)
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

How it all turned to lies?

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times

This is more than the typical kinda thing
Felt a jones in my bones when you were touching me
Uh-oh, didn’t wanna take it slow
In a daze, goin' craze, I can barely think
You’re replayin' in my brain, find it hard to sleep
Uh-oh, waitin' for my phone to blow
Uh-oh, yup

[Pre-Chorus: Amy]
Now I’m here in a sticky situation
Got a bit of trouble, yup, and now I’m pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it’s been an hour
I don’t wanna think too hard, but I’m sour
Uh-oh, I can’t seem to let you go

[Chorus: Amy]
See, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby
So let’s get up, let’s get on it
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right

So can we finish what we started?
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right, cheerio!

What’s the time? Such a crime, not a single word
Sippin' on that Patrón, just to calm my nerves
Uh-oh, poppin’ bottles by the phone, oh yeah

That’s enough, call me up, baby, I’m in doubt
Uh-oh, and I don’t even think you know
No, no, no

Anything you wanna do, I’ll be on it too
Everything you said, is like gold with a view
Business in the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack?
This kinda thing doesn’t happen usually
I’m on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it, so come and get it
Cheerio

See, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

Dreams: that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then...

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamoured, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

[Chorus: Jason Chen]
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good
In the SGV
So what we eat late
That's how it’s supposed to be
6-2-6, young, wild, and free
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good
In the SGV
So what we eat late
That's how it's supposed to be
6-2-6, young, wild, and free

[Verse 1: Andrew]
Hey, let me tell you about a place out east
Just Fifteen minutes from the LA streets
Hollywood doesn’t even know we exist
Like it's a mystical land, filled with immigrants
The food's authentic, the price is perfect
Where restaurants focus on the taste not service
Be ready to share 'cause it's family style
Time with the fam, makes granny proud!
[Verse 2: David]
We're far enough from LA where nobody's actin' phony!
Except maybe on our taxes, it’s cash only!
Tell the health department stop hating
’Cause a B rating stands for better tasting
Where kids drink more milk tea than liquor
And they roast more duck than Swishers
It's the 6-2-6, man check the address
Home of Sriracha and Panda Express

[Chorus: Jason Chen/Andrew]
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good

So what we eat late

So what we eat late
That's how it's supposed to be
6-2-6, young, wild, and free (haha, hey, yo)
[Verse 3: Andrew & David]
Sometimes I wonder, am I still in America
How come there’s still a language barrier?
If you need help, read Yelp, check the reviews
My Elite friends make it easy to choose
There's traditional rivalries between high schools
They started back when there was still some white dudes
No matter where you go they can't match the price
So you're always coming back to the Cafe Life
If J-Town's got sake and K-Town soju
What do we have? Oh yea we got bobas
Hot spots to get some, hot pot and dim sum
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
From Shanghai to Saigon, Tokyo to Taiwan
Beijing to Hong Kong something to bite on
Valley, Atlantic, Garvey, I drive on
3 in the morning, cafes got their lights on

[Chorus: Jason Chen]
So what we hang out
So what we drink tea
We just eating good
In the SGV
So what we eat late
That's how its 'sposed to be

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
And you let her go
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
When you let her go
Whoa

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low

White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss
[Verse 2]
I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Da, da da da da, da da da da
Blow me one last kiss
Da, da da da da, da da da da
Blow me one last kiss

I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe
I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the ""why's"" will be crystal clear

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss

Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh-whoa) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh-whoa) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

[Refrain]
Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh
Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh
Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh
Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
This is it, boys, this is war
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
What are we waiting for?
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Save that for the black and white
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style
[Bridge]
And that's alright (That's Alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who, I, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm, mmm

[Chorus]
Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

[Bridge]
(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No, when I see stars, when I s-
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So come on, oh come on, oh come on
Oh come on
[Verse 2]
Well, that is it, guys, that is all
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Five minutes in, and I'm bored again
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

[Bridge]
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we both agreed
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
For the best you didn't listen

I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
[Chorus: Rihanna & Drake]
'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you, instead, they say

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Verse 2]
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand

Oh, it's so sexy, yo

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (Ya)
For one more chance to hold you close
(It's your boy Travie, Gym Class Heroes)
I don't know where you're going (Let's go, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November now December's almost gone
I'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & (Travie McCoy)]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, ok, what's that?)
Just get your ass back home
[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up, yuck - 'cause they be swallowin' it

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & (Travie McCoy)]
I don't know where you're going (Yeah)
Or when you're coming home (Alright)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm coming home, mama)
(Mama, I'm coming home)
To our front door (That's love)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this
And we'll be alright, trust that
We put the ""us"" in ""trust"", baby
Ahh, let's go!
[Bridge: Neon Hitch]
I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 1]
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Verse 2]
My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 2]
She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Bridge]
I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to love...
But you don't want to

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

How old is your soul?

Yara iyileşir derler -ki asla iyileşmez
Bu sevgi ile savaşmana yol açıyor
Sevgi ile savaştasın, evet

[Hook: Guy Sebastian]
Bu savaş yaraları geçecek gibi durmuyor
Asla yok olacak gibi durmuyor
Yaralar asla değişmeyecek
Bu savaş

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Bir yaranın beni yıkması için asla vermedim izni
Ama bu enkaz bana kur yapıyor gibi
Oklar gelişigüzel geliyor ve Eros yapıyor galiba fazla mesai
Salak gibi hissediyorsun çünkü biliyorsun hayır artık biz diye bir şey yok
Fakat sen olasılıkları yenmeye çalıştıkça
Ben senin moralini yüksek tutmaya çalışıyorum ve sende biliyorsun bilmen gerekeni
Ve bırak kızı gitsin fakat o bilinmeyenin korkusu
Kızın başka bir sevgilisi olması gönderir seni tekrar savaş alanına
(Git!) fakat yoktur bir Tom Hanks seni eve geri getirecek
Şiiriyle ön cephede olan bir aşık, değildir bir savaşçı
Tüfek yazmayı dene kendine, belki git şarkını bile
Tanklarla ve drone’larla savaşmak için, yalnız olmandan dolayı

[Pre-Hook: Guy Sebastian]
Keşke hiç bakmasaydım, keşke hiç dokunmasaydım
Keşke sana sırılsıklam aşkımı bitirebilsem
Çünkü benim sadece ikimizi bir arada tutmaya çalışan
Tüm işaretler seni unutmam gerektiğini söylerken
Keşke en iyisi sen olmasaydın, yaşadığım en iyisi
Keşke, keşke iyilik üstesinden gelseydi kötülüğün
Çünkü bu asla bitmeyecek, ta ki sen bitti diyene kadar
[Hook: Guy Sebastian]
Bu savaş yaraları, geçecek gibi durmuyor
Gidecek gibi durmuyor
Yaralar asla değişmeyecek
Bu savaş yaraları, geçecek gibi durmuyor
Gidecek gibi durmuyor
Yaralar asla değişmeyecek
Bu savaş

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
(O zaman git hadi terket)
Söylememen gerekiyordu fakat söyledin
(Ve umarım asla geri dönmezsin)
Olmaması gerekiyordu ama sen sebep oldun
Şimdi düşmüşsün yere “Doktor” diye bağırıyorsun
Bunun getirdiği tek şey travma sonrası stresi
Kalkanlar, çelik yelekler ve zırhlar
Adam akıllı çalışmıyor, bu yüzden kilitlendin sen acıdan yapılmış bir dolaba
Düşman senin içinde ve gelen tüm kurşunlar da arkadaşlarından
Artık en iyi ilaç kızın kazanmasına izin vermek gibi duruyor

[Pre-Hook 2: Guy Sebastian]
Keşke artık hissetmesem, keşke artık sevmesem
Keşke durdurabilsem çünkü mahvediyor bu beni
Çünkü benim sadece ikimizi bir arada tutmaya çalışan
Tüm işaretler seni unutmam gerektiğini söylerken
Keşke en iyisi sen olmasaydın, yaşadığım en iyisi
Keşke, keşke iyilik üstesinden gelseydi kötülüğün
Çünkü bu asla bitmeyecek, ta ki sen bitti diyene kadar

Bu savaş yaraları, geçecek gibi durmuyor
Gidecek gibi durmuyor
Yaralar asla değişmeyecek

[Bridge: Guy Sebastian & (Lupe Fiasco)]
Çünkü beni ateşe verdin (ateşe)
Asla bu kadar canlı hissetmemiştim, evet!
(Hayır, umuyorsun ki yaralar iyileşir -ki asla iyileşmez
İşte bu sevgi ile savaşmana yol açıyor)
Ve artık dönüşü olmayan yerdeyim
Ve imkansız bunu düzeltmek

[Pre-Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Görüyorsun, yaralar iyileşir diye umdun -ki asla iyileşmez
Bu sevgi ile savaşmana yol açıyor
İyileşir diye um -ki asla iyileşmez
Bu sevgi ile savaşmana yol açıyor!

[Verse 1]
To my dear dearly departed
Shit's becomin' all that I feared, here's where it started
Seems that nothing's as it appears, swear it's retarded
No wonder I get speared by my peers, yeah I'm a target
It used to take a nation of millions for niggas not to be
AmeriKKKa's Most gave America hope
Back when the music had a message in it
We was rebels against it
The best was intended to lessen the gimmicks
But now y'all made a mess of it
And somebody gotta address this shit
Rakim would never wear a dress and shit
I ain't a pessimist to say I ain't impressed with it
Your hearing's bad, you think it's alive, now that's the death in it
When it was all about bars, wanted to weddin' it
Surround yourself with bullshit, you'll be liable to step in it
Came here with one objective, gettin' it further
Now I'm watchin' my first love die, witnessin' murder
When Common stopped lovin' ol' girl, what was he tellin' me?
Cold world, now she won't dig you without a melody
Love nerds, used to be into niggas with felonies
We need a new president, where the fuck is Eric B?
Or did my wordplay confuse her?
Now I see her with Young Thug and Future
Like what did you niggas do to her?
Now, my generalization is this generation
The imminent state of this gentrification, desensitization
I call her, she's in Marvin's room, everything is awkward now
She moved more to south, deserted her New Yorker crowd
Met her with a cane, she changed, prefer to walk it out
Stopped eatin' meat when she heard I worked in a slaughterhouse
Now she's a new dame glued to the fame
She used to hate accessorizin', now she's wearin' two chains
Relationship too strained, I don't know who to blame
When I tell her, ""You changed"", she say, ""Who would be the same""
She right... cause this ain't the way we knew each other
Or do I face the fact that maybe we outgrew each other?
It took a while, but that's finally understood
She wouldn't change if she could
I swear if this is love, I'm good
[Hook]
Everything has changed, I can see it clear in fact
Starin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back
Took a while, now it's finally understood
Would we change it if we could?
I swear if this is love, I'm good

[Verse 2]
Look, I can't get with you at all, our issue is tall
You tied to every nigga now that dribbles a ball
Did I miss a red flag? You wasn't fickle before
I can't even ridicule y'all, that'd be a bitter resolve
Wanna talk about our history
I feel like everything you say is contradictory
Whenever you come visit me
I look at you and see remembrance, remnants
Plenty resentments, it's not you but there's resemblance
We diss each other all out of fun, shit amuses me
You threaten every girl I'm with, that just confuses me
Say you want kids real soon, now that's abuse to me
And I just write about it in song, you're like a muse to me
I wanna ask where you see yourself in five years
How you goin' about that, like what's the verdict?
I wanna ask if you ever replay the past over
And if you do, when you finished is it worth it?
I wanna ask if we love each other so much
How do we cause each other so much pain?
Still in all in each others lives
We've remained without a claim
I know some'll call that clinically insane
How do we remedy the games?
Was once enemies and then that energy refrained
Wasn't meant to be, the synergy had us mentally drained
Minimally sprained so relentlessly he aims
Despite when you said you never could depend on me again
Still we're here as none of this had ever taken place
Are we checkin' to see if someone's takin' our place?
As we front like we're takin' up space
I think currently the current we is makin' our case
But for what? Would that just seal it again
Did it all hurt so much? Do we wanna feel it again? I doubt it
Took a while, still nothing's understood
Would we change it if we could?
I swear if this is love, I'm good
[Hook]
Everything has changed, I can see it clear in fact
Starin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back
Took a while, now it's finally understood
Would we change it if we could?
I swear if this is love, I'm good

[Verse 3]
Look, I can see the pain in your eyes, I wanna fix it
But all your words are fuelin' my pride, so I'm dismissive
You think I wanna sit in this courtroom
Talkin' supervised, scrutinized by suit and ties? You a lie
You could cry, the conditions of you and I, can't escape it
Every lie she told you over the years, I'm face to face with
And now they manifested
You're overwhelmed and congested
But feelin' neglected, I gotta respect it
I can't explain to your so young brain
Since our first exchange you've been kept from me
Used against as weaponry
And as much as I hate her
I'd never downplay your mother like that
For you to judge her like that
Just a lesson later on that you'll discover like that
We not alone in this process, no, it's others like that
But you spew these sly remarks like, ""Why are we here?
Like why are you near? Like why do you care, how is this fair?""
I gotta eat that, see you got a grudge, lil' nigga
We flesh and blood, lil' nigga, no ifs, ands or buts, lil' nigga
You can think your dad is nuts, lil' nigga
I'm talkin' to you cause you came out of my nuts, lil' nigga
That's my stance on the matter, I won't budge, lil' nigga
And I'll tell that to your mother and the judge, lil' nigga
At our next court date, you gon' see that it's true
Funny, my condescendin' ways, I kinda see 'em in you
Mannerisms when I'm annoyed, yep I'm seein' that too
I'm smilin', admirin' genes, I kinda think that it's cute
I was you 20 years ago when pop popped up
But nothin' like you, sad how life'll recycle a cycle
You missin' intel only a dad can give
Can't expect you to understand, this doesn't matter to a kid
And since our situation's not understood
I would fix it if I could
I swear if this is love, I'm good
[Hook]
Everything has changed, I can see it clear in fact
Starin' at these four walls, angry that they're starin' back
Took a while, now it's finally understood
Would we change it if we could?
I swear if this is love, I'm good2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Haven't you heard the rumours? (Bless your soul)

You won’t find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice or staying out ’til three
You won’t ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
You won’t find him tryna change the devil
For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo

When the money’s spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can’t seem to find no help or love for free
I know that there’s no need for me to panic
'Cause I’ll find him, I’ll find him next to me
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need’s a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
[Verse 2]
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tiger's on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
[Bridge]
(Oh, oh-oh)
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
(Oh, oh-oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us

Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

When I'm wiser and I'm older

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands

Wish that I could stay forever this young

And love is the prize

With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)

Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart

Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find

On just doing what we're told

All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about

Our clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and She'll
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out

[Verse 1]
Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes, as well
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell
[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

[Post-Chorus]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

[Verse 2]
So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

[Chorus]
We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

[Post-Chorus]
I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now

Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""High, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

[Verse 2]
Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
""High, why'd you only call me when you're high?""
[Bridge]
And I can't see you here, wonder where I might
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you got to be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""

[Outro]
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

When I was young I thought adults were kids grown up
It turns out they're grown up kids
And nothing really tends to change the way people behave
It's their own grave that they dig
Why can't you just compromise?
Why ya gotta be so stubborn?
You make this harder than it needs to be
Why ya gotta dramatize?
Why ya gotta throw 'em in the gutter?
The way you act is unnecessary

[Pre-Chorus: Garrett Williamson & Emma Rose Williamson]
He is making bad decisions
But he'll listen to no one
He says that guy was the problem, using manipulation
What's your reason for division?
Is holding grudges now an art?
You just wanna cause a problem and you're tearing this apart

And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all

Will come calling out at the mess you've made

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes

It's killing me to see you this way

I don't mind
Lettin' you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, well just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feedin' on

So what are you gonna do

You might be the one who's runnin' things
Well you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
You see it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're livin' in a bubble

2014 was crazy
Woah

[Verse]
I heard Puff put hands on Drake
Troy Ave got the ""Tuesday"" kid punched in his face
Chris Brown went on Instagram and told us that his girl fucked Drake
The 'Gram took niggas' followers, they violated Mase
They took 1.5 million, I seen that shit
Mase was so embarrassed, he deleted his shit
J. Cole sold three sixty his first week
Nicki broke up with Safaree and start fucking Meek
Lil Wayne don't want to fuck with Baby
But the contract he signed got him stuck with Baby
I say shit that make niggas think
Five niggas told me K. Michelle pussy stink
Seen Bobby Shmurda on Jimmy Fallon
Jimmy Kimmel, now they got him on Riker's Island
Free the whole GS9
The law hate seeing niggas shine
What they won't say, Im'ma write it
Two cops got killed cause two cops ain't get indicted
They took Eric Garner, shot Mike Brown in the head
And now two innocent cops is dead
And real talk, that's not what's up
The KKK laughing like ""ha, that wasn't none of us""
That probably went over your head
Y'all rather talk about Bill Cosby instead
Or Jay and Solange in the elevator
Do ya know the police upset with the mayor?
Cause he supported the protest
The revolution coming, people just don't know it yet
They know what happened on Love & Hip Hop
Don't know what Young Thug said but still think his shit hot
The realest yearly rap up you ever heard
I'm just stating a few facts and some shit that I heard
G-Unit back together minus The Game
At Summer Jam on stage, niggas took Slow chains
Then Slowbucks tried to set it on Fab and 'em
Cause they was on stage when it happened, they was mad at him
I got to talk about this shit
I'm still bugging now how Angie made that Power switch
Amber and Wiz going through that divorce now
The other day, I seen her twerking on Chris Brown
Suge got shot in the club in front of Chris Brown
Then they tried to say it was meant for Chris Brown
T.I. swung on Floyd and 'em
Rest in peace to Earl Hayes, I did a song with him
Rest in peace to his wife
He killed her then took his own life
Boosie home, Remy back home
LeBron left Miami and went back home
That Ebola had niggas shook
Ray Rice knocked out his wife with the left hook
French got a Kardashian under them sheets
My nigga Jeezy and Rick Ross deaded their beef
But everybody beefing with Iggy
Dre & Jimmy sold Dre Beats for 3 billi
The realest yearly rap up you ever heard
I'm just stating a few facts and some shit that I heard
[Outro]
Yo know
You need people like me so you could
Point your finger at and say
""That's the bad guy""
Yeah
2015, what's good
GMG
ATM
New Money
Woah
It's the Rap Up

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—
[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—
[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
And you let her go
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
When you let her go
Whoa

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined
[Chorus: Brenda Russell with Flo Rida]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no

Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next, get a call, just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Buggatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears, dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic
[Chorus: Brenda Russell with Flo Rida]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle

Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know it's all better now

All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man, I'm sure
When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

[Chorus]
But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody
Like you, oh, oh, oh
Like you, like you

[Verse 2]
So you brought out the best in me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is

I don't know why
You think that you could hold me
When you couldn't get by by yourself
And I don't know who
Would ever want to tear the seam of someone's dream
Baby, it's fine, you said that we should just be friends
Well I came up with that line and I'm sure
That it's for the best
If you ever change your mind, don't hold your breath

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
When you said goodbye, my whole world shined

Hey hey hey
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling
If we're drinking, then I'm buying
And I know there's no denying
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's playing
And even if it started raining
You wouldn't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one that got away
It's a beautiful day

It's my turn to fly, so girls, get in line
'Cause I'm easy, no playing this guy like a fool
'Cause now I'm alright
You might've had me caged before, but not tonight

This fire inside, it burns too bright
I don't want to say “so long”, I just want to say “goodbye”

Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 2]
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""
[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 3]
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

[Verse 4]
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

[Interlude]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I'll put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine

Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

You've had a few?

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts

Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water
[Pre-Chorus: JAY-Z]
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why
Why I love you so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name?
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over

[Couplet 1]
Dites-moi d'où il vient
Enfin je saurai où je vais
Maman dit que lorsqu'on cherche bien
On finit toujours par trouver
Elle dit qu'il n'est jamais très loin
Qu'il part très souvent travailler
Maman dit ""travailler c'est bien""
Bien mieux qu'être mal accompagné
Pas vrai ?

Où est ton papa ?
Dis-moi où est ton papa ?
Sans même devoir lui parler

Ah sacré papa
Dis-moi où es-tu caché ?
Ça doit, faire au moins mille fois que j'ai
Compté mes doigts

Quoi, qu'on y croit ou pas
Y aura bien un jour où on n'y croira plus
Un jour ou l'autre on sera tous papa
Et d'un jour à l'autre on aura disparu
Serons-nous détestables ?
Serons-nous admirables ?
Des géniteurs ou des génies ?
Dites-nous qui donne naissance aux irresponsables ?
Ah dites-nous qui, tiens
Tout le monde sait comment on fait des bébés
Mais personne sait comment on fait des papas
Monsieur Je-sais-tout en aurait hérité, c'est ça
Faut l'sucer d'son pouce ou quoi ?
Dites-nous où c'est caché, ça doit
Faire au moins mille fois qu'on a
Bouffé nos doigts

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up

[Verse 1]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl, why is you lying? Girl, why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side

Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So, therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up
[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do (No, no)
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you (You and me)
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)

And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

But I'll kneel down
Wait for now

Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it
[Trombone Interlude]
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
[Outro: Mary Lambert]

I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting tired and I need someone to rely on

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know

Broken bottles in the hotel lobby
Seems to me like I'm just scared of never feelin' it again
I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
But it's not that easy

I remember it now, it takes me back to when it all first started
But I only got myself to blame for it and I accept it now
It's time to let it go, go out and start again
But It's not that easy

But I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes
When you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes
When it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning around

And in my dreams I meet the ghosts of all the people who've come and gone
Memories, they seem to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon
Naive, I was just staring at the barrel of a gun
I do believe it

Yeah, but I've got high hopes

Screaming, crying, perfect storms

If I got you, I'm straight
You'll bring my heart to life, yeah

I miss the conversation

Oh, baby, why did you run away?

In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (Mmm, yeah)
I say, ""I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl
He says, ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I""
I said, ""I've been there too a few times""
[Chorus]
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
(A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

[Bridge]
Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh
(Out of style)

Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

[Verse 1]
I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel something so right doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Said no more counting dollars, we'll be, we'll be counting stars

I feel your love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: Harry]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
[Chorus: Harry]
We're only getting older, baby

I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

All her life, she has seen
Oh the meanest side of me
They took away the prophet's dream
For a profit on the street
Now she's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow
All his life, he's been told
He'll be nothing when he's old
All the kicks and all the blows
He won't ever let it show
Because he's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

[Chorus]
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That’s a how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)
When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That’s a how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)

All the hurt, all the lies
All the tears that they cry
When the moment is just right
You'll see fire in their eyes
Because they're stronger than you know

Cause they've taken too much hits take it blow by blow

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth

You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

And I'll bet the odds against it all

You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Chorus] (x2)
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

[Drop]
Don't blame it on me!

[Verse 2]
Can't you see it? I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door
I had no choice in this, I was the friend she missed
She needed me to talk

[Chorus] (x2) + [Drop]

Oh I'm so sorry, so sorry baby
(I'll be better this time)
I will be better this time
I got to say
I'm so sorry
Oh I promise

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing
[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
[Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby
(Black, black widow, baby)

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh
[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
You used to be thirsty for me (Right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill

Come through and fuck him in my automobile

I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies

In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

Know you say you down with it
Won’t tell em how you hit the ground with it
Girl, you know I’m from Chicago

Nobody take me out, though
You got gifts, bring 'em down the South Pole
Marathon doll gon' put in miles
Don’t you worry 'bout him, I gon' work it out

Girl, he fufu with it
But you know I know what to do with it
I'll give you that, girl, I'm talking laps
As if you got a pool in it
And she say she ain't with your best friends
Then let me be your diamond
You know you feeling, how your boy press play
Just keep that ass rewindin'

Only is you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips

It’s some Twitter pussy, I met on the Internet
On my late-night thirsty, ‘cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin'
Handcuff me to the bed, girl it ain't no bailin'

If anything you was explorin', you wasn’t cheating

Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin' game

And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho

Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you’ll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start

[Pre-Chorus]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you’re worth it

[Chorus]
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me (Staring back at me)

I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing
[Chorus]
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
[Chorus]
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
[Verse 3]
(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
[Chorus]
Don't (hhh)  with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows

You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now, sadly, I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

But when you call me baby

Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

My friends had you figured out
Yeah they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake

I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah it's still burning

And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you

Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
'Cause I love living innocent
Oh, you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learned

Give up the ghost, stop the haunting baby
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, no more haunting baby

And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way

And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

Blacked out
Everything faded on your love
I’m already wasted so close
That I can taste it now, now
So let’s break right out of these gilded cages
We’re going to make it now
Don’t ever turn around
Don’t ever turn around

Nobody else needs to know
Where we might go
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
There ain’t no reason to stay
We’ll be light years away
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights
We could just run them red lights

White lights, flirt in the darkness
This road leads where your heart is
These signs, something we can’t ignore
We can’t back down
We’ll never let them change us
We’re going to make it now
What are we waiting for...
What are we waiting for...

And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one

[Pre-Chorus]
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

[Chorus]
But I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

[Post-Chorus]
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Yeah, let's be clear, I won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doin' everythin' I can
And another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain
I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
Oh, I'm jealous of the wind

[Chorus]
I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me

[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh, I'm jealous of the nights
I'm jealous of the love
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh, I'm jealous of the love, 'cause

Watch you slip through my hands

Oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, ""This nigga buggin'""
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song
[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth
[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know

Some people want me to be heads or tails
I say no way, try again, another day
I should be happy, not tipping the scales
I just won't play letting my life get away

Tension burning, fever high
Take me to another dimension
Tonight the rules do not apply

Caution flies right out the door
Baby you're pushing this devotion
I can only ask for more

And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

Well me, I fall in love with you every single day

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way

And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play (Hey)
Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid

He said, one day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die

Carve your name into those shining stars
He said, go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are

One day my father he told me
Son, don't let it slip away
When I was just a kid, I heard him say

Cause I'mma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burn up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, ""Wanna ride out?"", and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

Go ahead baby let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drop

You know me I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck

Forget about bills and the first of the month

You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on

The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

Know exactly where it leads, but I

Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I""

I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness

So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight

I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

I found myself dreaming in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone
I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

[Chorus: Meghan Trainor]
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted

When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you)
I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you

[Verse 2: John Legend, (Meghan Trainor), Both]
In the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything, the truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, babe (Hey), any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret
Let's take our time to say what we want (Say what we want)
Use what we got before it's all gone (All gone)
'Cause no (No), we're not promised tomorrow

A lot of fight left in me

What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down
[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants

Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?

You can twerk while in a split, you racking up them tips

Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

Everybody here is watching you

The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
We don’t have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with

[Chorus]
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness

We’re running out of time
Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You’re willing to fight, to be right

[Pre-Chorus]
Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

Kill 'em with kindness

Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness

[Video directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson]
[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life1.6KEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to

Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone

And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone

Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

But I've found my friend at the curtains of the waterfall

And you've come around at the curtains of the waterfall
And you rushed to me and it sets us free

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
[Bridge]
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?

That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you

No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Don’t wanna have to lose all that I've compromised
To feel another high
I’ve got to keep it down tonight

And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was a king under your control
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go

I had to break myself to carry on
No love and no admission
Take this from me tonight
Oh-oh, let's fight
Oh-oh-oh, let's fight
Oh-oh, let's fight
Oh-oh-oh

I was a king under your control
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna feel like you’ve let me go
So let me go

Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't

Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, fuck the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?
[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 1]
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself
[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 2]
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
[Bridge]
We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter
[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[Bridge]
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[Outro]
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face

[Verse 1]
It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

I always hear, always hear them talking
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
Uh, fuck, I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you li' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick (brr brr)
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…
[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you

I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…
[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean + (E-40)]
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…
[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself150EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

So, baby, pull me closer

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

You fight me off like a firefighter
So tell me why you still get burned
You say you're not, but you're still a liar
'Cause I'm the one that you run to first

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time, yeah, why do you try to deny it?
When you show up every night and
Tell me that you want me, but it's complicated, so complicated

[Chorus]
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good

[Verse 2]
Every time that I swear it's over
It makes you want me even more
You pull away and I come in closer
And all we ever stay is torn
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, I don't know why I try to deny it
When you show up every night
I tell you that I want you, but it's complicated, so complicated

[Chorus]
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good

[Bridge]
Wide awake through the daylight
Would you hold me like we're running a yellow light?
Reach for you with my hands tied
Are we dancing like we're burning in paradise?

[Chorus]
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter
[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[Bridge]
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[Outro]
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face

I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness

By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within
[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful94EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Would you trust me when you're jumping from the heights?

When the sadness leaves you broken in your bed

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

Take my hand, we'll be fine

Could wake up in make up and play dumb
Pretending that I need a boy
Who's gonna treat me like a toy

But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king

Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be

But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Move on

Begging you to come help

I'll be needing stitches

And I want you to sing it again

Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories?
Can I be him?

Will you be there to sing it again?
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories?

[Bridge]
Can I be the one?
Can I be the one?
Can I be the one?
Oh, can I, can I be him?

Won't you sing it again
Oh, when you sing it again
Can I be him
Won't you sing it again
Oh, when you sing it again
Can I be him?

I swear that every word you sang
You wrote them for me
Like it was a private show
But I know you never saw me

Will you be there, will you be there
Can I be the one you talk about in all your stories

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

[Pre-Chorus 1: Selena Gomez]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

[Chorus: Selena Gomez with Charli XCX]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know
[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough

I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Post-Chorus]
I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs

[Verse 2]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Verse 2]
I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
It’s so hard
So hard
[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Bridge]
And I know that it’s wrong
That I can’t move on
But there’s something about you

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you88EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

This is gonna hurt, but I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off of that love, my head up
There's no forgetting you

[Pre-Chorus]
You've awoken me, but you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly, I got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously
Mmm, mmm
I loved you dangerously

Usually I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back
Look at how things changed
'Cause now you're the train
And I'm tied to the track

I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me

Didn't care if the explosion ruined me

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips with goodbye
I see it now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know, there's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire, I'm gasoline

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
[Bridge]
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?

I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that
I type a text, but thеn I never mind that
I got thesе feelings, but you never mind that
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song
[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien & gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you

Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight

Looking high and low, someone let me know

Talking them up about the things they do so well

Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more It’s just you and me

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was

""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" an' that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

[Chorus]
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

[Verse 2]
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Verse 2]
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me
[Pre-Chorus]
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Bridge]
It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?
[Breakdown]
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young88EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life (Yeah)
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul
[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Hun, and as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
‘Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends!
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends, yeah
[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & (G-Eazy)]
Oh, it's just me, myself and I

I don't need anything (Yeah) to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive (Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (You know)
‘Cause the music does me good
And it gets me every time
[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, and I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go apeshit
Say ""Fuck y'all!"" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it—tell me now, isn't it funny? (Nah)
[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & (G-Eazy)]
Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die

I don't need anything (Yeah) to get me through the night
Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive (Keeps me alive)

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yeah, lonely nights I laid awake
Pray to Lord my soul to take
My heart's become too cold to break
Know I'm great, but I'm broke as hell
Havin' dreams that I'm foldin' cake
All my life I've been told to wait
But I'ma get it now, yeah, it's no debate
Yeah
[Chorus: Bebe Rexha & (G-Eazy)]
Oh, it's just me, myself and I

I tried hard to make you want me
But we're not supposed to be
And the truth will always haunt me
Even though it set me free
And my tears flow like the ocean
As they floated in the breeze
They were falling in slow motion
And they brought me to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn off the light and now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you

Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
And I'll get over you

When did you lose your emotion?
When did you become so cruel?
And if you want to cut me open
Says a thousand words 'bout you
And in time I know you'll leave me
Like a distant memory
I know love can be so easy
If I start by loving me, oh

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

[Verse 1]
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus]
Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)
[Verse 3]
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

[Bridge]
Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

[Chorus]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
[Breakdown]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Oh, baby, won't you cum again?
She said ""I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering""

You're so conceited, I said ""I love you""
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it, but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it

And there's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
Oh, and you say (You say) I'm such a cliché
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

Wait for them to ask you who you know

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You’ll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You’ll never know  the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves

They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions

Nod my head, don't close my eyes

Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive

Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead

Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within
[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh

I’m never gonna find my way
If I don’t run to that goal
The past is the past, today is today
And there’s things I can’t control
The circles underneath my eyes
Tell the truth that I've been trying to hide
I’ve been waiting for you way too long
Won’t you come and take me home

Can you, you, wake me up before you leave

Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up

'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold

Look how we've grown

Alright, 'cause we got the keys to the universe

Hey mama, don't stress your mind, we ain't coming home tonight
Hey ma, we gonna be alright, dry those eyes

You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

[Chorus]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got

I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart

Ripping all the skin from off my bones

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything

Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of

Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading

They pull you in to feel your heartbeat

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you

I'm way too good at goodbyes

I'm way too good at goodbyes

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
But she said, where d'you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time

Ooh, look what you made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

Our love was strong as a lion
Soft as the cotton you lie in
Times we got hot like an iron
You and I
Our hearts had never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk 'til the morning
You and I

[Pre-Chorus]
We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating, had it repeating

[Chorus]
You were my September Song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen
You were my September Song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station
Passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers
You and I
[Pre-Chorus]
Still, I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating, got it repeating

[Chorus]
You were my September song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
I hear that September song, that I'm singing along
Thinking about you and me, oh, what a melody

[Bridge]
And as the years go by
You will still be my, be my (September song)
You are my (September song)

You were my September song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen

Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Weil sie sagen, wir hätten es schon getan
Wende dich an Gucci, wenn du mich jemals brauchst
Ich werde am South Beach im glänzenden Cabrio sein
Wasser Diamanten, Aquafina
Brauche dich nur im blauen Bikini
[Refrain: Selena Gomez]
Du hast einen Fetisch für meine Liebe
Ich drück dich weg, doch du kommst sofort wieder
Sehe keinen Grund, dir dafür die Schuld zu geben
Wenn ich du wäre, würde ich auch Sex mit mir haben
Du hast einen Fetisch für meine Liebe
Ich drück dich weg, doch du kommst sofort wieder
Sehe keinen Grund, dir dafür die Schuld zu geben
Wenn ich du wäre, würde ich auch Sex mit mir haben
Du hast einen Fetisch für meine LiebeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill85EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I woke up with a fear this morning
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alarm without no warning
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

[Pre-Chorus]
Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say, “Love, baby, let’s go back to my flat”
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don’t wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like I'm

No fear but I think I'm falling, I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run (Oh)
No risk so I think I’m all-in
When I kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
And now we’re way up, dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch
And then you say, “Love, this is what it's all about”
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense

Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever

Used to take me out, in your fancy car
And make out in the rain
And when I ring you up
Don't know where you are
'Til I hear her say your name
Used to sing along, when you played guitar
That's a distant memory
Hope she treats you better than you treated me, ha

[Chorus]
I'm onto you, yeah, you
I'm not your number one
I saw you, with her
Kissing and having fun
If you're giving her all of your money and time
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you
Ciao adios, I'm done, uh
Ciao adios, I'm done
Ciao adios, I'm done
[Verse 2]
After three, after four times
Why did I bother?
Tell me how many more times
Does it take to get smarter?
Don't need to deny the hurt and the lies
And all of the things you did to me
I swear, I know you did

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you take her out, in your fancy car
And make out in the rain
And when she rings you up
She know where you are
But I know differently
Now she sings along, when you play guitar
Making brand new memories
Hope you treat her better than you treated me

[Chorus]
I'm onto you, yeah, you
I'm not your number one (yeah)
I saw you, with her (with her)

Some people would say
To accept defeat

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low, I been taking my time

I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why
[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna

Baby, take it slow so we can last long

¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza

Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion

I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song

Can't take back the love that I gave you

I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?

[Chorus 1: Phillip Carlyle]
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight

[Verse 2: Anne Wheeler]
You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why
Because we're able to be
Just you and me
Within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all
[Chorus 2: Anne Wheeler]
No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours
Tonight

[Post Chorus: Both, Anne Wheeler, Phillip Carlyle]
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

[Chorus 3: Phillip Carlyle and Anne Wheeler]
How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing can keep us apart
Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'

The curtains drawn, shawty X-rated
You're purpose-grown, the world's greatest
I see no flaws, so let's face it (huh)
No Roseanne Barr, despite the ratings
She's independent (huh), I'm willing to spend it
Let me book the flight (boss), [?] the night
Before we turn the page so many quotes that I like
You inspire so much that I write
She's my van Gogh, such a work of art
This where my love lies in this sensitive heart
So what's your name? Tell me your number
This such a cold game, you all I want this summer

[Chorus: Khalid & Normani]
So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
For my whole lifetime
[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent (independent)

So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

[Verse 3: Normani]
I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it (you ain't with it)

I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…

Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud

[Verse 3]
Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud

And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing

I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay
[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

It doesn't matter, put the phone away

I know better than to call you mine

You need a pick me up?
I'll be there in twenty-five

And before your kisses turn into bruises, I'm a warning

Maybe I'ma get a little nervous
Maybe I don't go out anymore (Oh)
Feelin' like I really don't deserve this (-serve this)
Life ain't nothing like it was before (It was nothing like before)
'Cause all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface (Surface)
Baby, I'm a little insecure

And that's okay (Baby, now, that's okay)
I promise myself one day

I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

[Chorus]
But when I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

[Verse 2]
I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard

[Chorus]
When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt

It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill
[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrive in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott
[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?

Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue

Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit

All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

[Verse 2]
And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly but you need some imagination

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you
[Bridge]
I can't stop sweating or control my feet
Got a 20-stone monkey that I just can't beat
I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
And there's a feeling, you're replacing embrace

[Chorus]
It's true that all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

Oh, I'll try to get a job in a bank, I think
Danny spent the time trying to pack in the drinks for me

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind

Have a seat in the foyer, take a number

While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?

You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

And no, I don't like to be this way
And you're Jekyll and Hydein'
Are you real, are you lying?
So stop with your crying
I can't handle it now

You tell everyone our love went cold
Going 'round, spreading the word, it's over
If that's how you feel, then you should go
Don't come around saying, ""I still want ya""

Then you're telling me you can't breathe

But now you say you're done
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me

There you go, there, I said it
Don't look at me all offended

But you can't keep deceiving
Does it make you feel good?

Time never could heal this pain
I thought I believed in fate
Oh, it's so cruel
No, nothing for us would change
Same story, the same mistakes
This heart just had to break'
Oh whoa

[Chorus]
One minute, you say we're a team
Then you're telling me you can't breathe (can't breathe)
Well, you should set me free
Baby, if you're over me
Yesterday you said I'm the one (said I'm the one)
But now you say you're done (oh)
Stop telling me what I need (stop telling me what I need)
Baby, if you're over me

[Outro]
Just go if it's over (just go)
Just go if it's over (just go if it's over)
Just go if it's over

The way your fingers fit in mine
It's five plus five, not rocket science
This day in time, that's hard to find, it's true
The road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E

We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated

I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for

Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?

I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga
[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me145EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, ""Thank you"" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost

So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else

Far away from the wreck we made

Every single word is perfect as it can be

I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
Every single time, I find it harder to breathe

There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away

There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away

I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

Feel like the least of all your problems
You can reach me if you wanna, stay up tonight, stay up at night
Green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little company from me
But if you got everything figured out like you say
Don't waste a minute, don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time for you-ooh-ooh-ooh to-ooh-ooh-ooh

I can't fix each and all your problems
I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies, talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head, just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money, maybe someday, you can take it from me?
I'm up too late thinkin' 'bout you and M.I.A. for

Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it

This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking, we both know it
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

And high and dry, the desert wind

Man, what? (Haha)
This shit funny, one sec
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, ""You loved me first"" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, ""Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time they're insecure""
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?
[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Bridge]
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs, so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you
[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past

De la forma en que me miraba (Woh, oh, oh)
Podía notar que ella tenía lo que en la disco buscaba (Bailaba)
Quería que me bailara (Woh, oh)
Y el DJ que la música nunca me la bajara
Y se está prendí'a en fuego (Fuego)
Que no se enamora, ella está pa'l juego (Pa'l juego)
Anda sola, nunca le baja a su ego (A su ego)
Me provoca y facilito me le pego (Me le pego)
Y es que se está prendí'a en fuego (En fuego)

Anda sola, nunca le baja a su ego (A su ego)
Me provoca y facilito me le pego y es que (Jaja)

[Verso 2: Anuel AA, Ozuna & Daddy Yankee]
Yo tengo un problema de alcohol
Yo no sé por qué soy así (Así, así)
Pa' mí que el doctor estaba bebiendo

El ticket semanal puede ser que en ti lo gaste
Me creo bichote tirando lo' peso' (-so')

Manna big man, twenty racks on tax
Very sexy, yelly, Steffy (Bullet)
Baby shake up your bum-bum (Shake it)
Don't have sex without condoms (Nah)
Cali spliff looking Hong Kong (Loud)
I don't pipe your girl-, that's my don-don
Very selective, selected corn, eject it
The way he ran off, he meant it (Gone)
[Verse 2: Aitch]
Yo, both hands on the back when I tap it, grab it and slap it, Becky a savage
Lemme show you a magic trick, you can have this dick after that man vanish
Two MILFs in a whip, bro-bro said he wanted a bit, told him he can manage
This baby face an advantage, man still show a big girl what a man is
Give her my screw face, she caught me staring, what do you expect when your skirt's so short?
Out here twerking, gone past caring, she went out cheating, the girl got caught
Stepped in the place all shiny, I don't have a chain, man glow when I walk
Don't phone if you're wasting my time, got me changing my line 'cause I don't wanna talk

And I didn't wanna holla at Becky, so I went Brighton and holla'd at Britney
And how many chicks did I swipe? Top of my head, I think about fifty
And I don't really wanna hear nonsense
Man send one text to your female, now the bad B come looking like custard
Slim t'ic with the back come detail, give her back shot, two-two, now she loved it
And the ting come quick like a e-mail, mate well done, got brain and he cuffed it
JAY bun up the place like a moshpit, viral, now I got fans in Boston
Two stepped to the dance all saucy, one gun lean, man did it like Russ did
And everybody wanna link Keisha, Becky, ease up, likkle man stop it
Bad B from kway called Lisa, shit den, wanna take wood cah I'm poppin'
[Verse 4: Tion Wayne]
Everyday I give thanks for the blessings but I repent for numerous cheffings
If you saw the way that I kweffed him, man I weren't shocked that his bredrin left him
Bet they thought the last verse was a fluke ting, free my broski inside for some bootings
Man, I'm boasy, spend racks on a Cuban and my lightskin, brownskin or cute tings
Man I love to go west, spend figures, then I go home, eat bariis and hilib

All the things man seen and done in the field, nigga you won't know the half
And bro told me he just done that bait, so now he's in a petrol bath
Bro backed it, I told him dump off, dump off, before I back it, they run off
Hit that once, you can't be my lover, HMP, free up my brother

And I pray on my life that they ride in front the jakes so the whole tings done
Big up my chocolate darling, true say that she lost the plot
Doing up-Doing up Gucci gang with her nails on fleek as she whips that pot

I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Verse 1]
I could've showed you all the scars at the start
But that was always the most difficult part
See, I'm in love with how your soul's a mix of chaos and art
And how you never try to keep 'em apart (Yeah)
I wrote some words and then I stared at my feet
Became a coward when I needed to speak
I guess love took on a different kind of meaning for me
So when I go, just know it kills me to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
[Verse 2]
But there's beauty here that's yet to depart
There's still a song inside the halls in the dark (Halls in the dark)
I'll come for you if you just stay where you are
And I'll always hold your hand in the car (Hand in the car)
There'll be days when it's difficult
But I ask you to never leave behind the reciprocal, we're past that
Love is not designed for the cynical
So we have that (We have that)
We can have that

[Pre-Chorus]
To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
[Bridge]
How long can you wait for the one you deserve?
Fight on, never let it out, never let it out
If I'm gone, if you ever leave I hope that you learn
To fight on, to fight on

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Outro]
(How long?)
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
(How long?)
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere, somewhere6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
