[Verse 1]
Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (Life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor
And here's what it's for, so

[Chorus]
Come on, vogue (Vogue)
Let your body move to the music (Move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue (Vogue)
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

[Verse 2]
All you need is your own imagination
So use it that's what it's for (That's what it's for)
Go inside, for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door (Open up the door)
It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it will give you new life
You're a superstar
Yes, that's what you are, you know it

[Chorus]
Come on vogue (Vogue, vogue)
Let your body groove to the music (Groove to the music)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue (Vogue, vogue)
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

Beauty's where you find it
Not just where you bump and grind it
Soul is in the musical
That's where I feel so beautiful
Magical, life's a ball, so
Get up on the dance floor

[Chorus]

Let your body move to the music (Move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey

1,I've Been Thinking About You,Best! The Singles 16 Tracks,Londonbeat,1995-11-20,230066,64,"

[Verse 1]
We must have been stone crazy
When we thought we were just friends
'Cause I miss you, baby
And I've got those feelings again
I guess I'm all confused about you
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow

[Verse 2]
Suddenly we're strangers
I watch you walking away
She was my one temptation
Oh, I did not want her to stay
Deep down, I'm still confused about you
(Oh yes I am baby)
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow

[Bridge]
What good is being here without you? (I wanna know)
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow

[Chorus till fade]
(Oh baby, can't get you off my mind)

2,Freedom! '90,Ladies And Gentlemen... The Best Of George Michael,George Michael,1998-11-09,388400,57,"

[Intro]
I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom!
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
I will not give you up (Freedom!)
Gotta have some faith in the sound
(You got to give what you take)
It's the one good thing that I've got, (Freedom!)
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
So please don't give me up (Freedom!)
Cause I would really, really love to stick around (You got to give what you take)

[Verse 2]
Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy
What a kick, just a buddy and me
(What a kick, just a buddy and me)
We had every big-shot goodtime band on the run, boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race, got out of the place
Went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don’t think that I’ll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
I will not give you up, (Freedom!)
Gotta have some faith in the sound
(You got to give what you take)
It's the one good thing that I've got (Freedom!)
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
So please don't give me up (Freedom!)
Cause I would really, really love to stick around (You got to give what you take)

[Bridge]
Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last
That's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing your mind
And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom! (Oh!)
Freedom!
(My) Freedom!
You got to give what you take!
Freedom!
I'll hold on to my (Freedom!)
My (Freedom!)
You got to give what you take! (You got to give what, to give what, to give what you take!)

[Outro]
Yeah!
You got to give what, to give what, to give
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live

You told me I'd never leave you baby
But I don't believe this is happening all over again

I was such a fool
To think that you would ever change your ways
Even put your hand upon your heart
And said that no-one else can take my place
How was I so blind
I trusted every single word you said
I know I should have seen the light
But I just let your love go to my head

Ive taken you back before 'cause you told me you've changed
Looked in my eyes and said

Believe me, then you
Broke my heart and deceived me, when you
Said you never could leave me
But its happening all over again (no, no, no)

I promised to myself
I'd never make the same mistakes again (same mistakes)
And though I looked for someone else
I never really want to walk away

It seems that your just the same, I forgot all the pain
Look in your eyes, you said

Believe me, then you
Broke my heart and deceived me, when you
Said you never could leave me
But its happening all over again
But its happening all over again
(You said believe me)
But its happening all over again
(Deceived me)
But its happening all over again
(Believe me)
But its happening all over again
But its happening all over again

Ive taken you back before 'cause you told me you've changed
Looked in my eyes and said

(Repeat till fade)
Believe me, then you
Broke my heart and deceived me, when you
Said you never could leave me

Dig it like a shovel, rhyme devil on a heavenly level
Bang the bass, turn up the treble

Maniac brainiac, winnin' the game

Quality I possess, some say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone that I am holding
Copy written lyrics so they can't be stolen
If they are, Snap! Don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice will cease
So please, stay off my back
Or I will attack, and you don't want that

Fresh new kicks, and pants
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move outta yo seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on!
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

Give me a song, or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' 'bout the Hammer, you're talkin' 'bout a show
That's hyped, and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair

Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump

Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)

Stop, Hammer time!

Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doin' this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's ""Hammer!"" ""Go Hammer!"" ""MC Hammer!"" Yo Hammer!""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this

I promised I'd wait for you
The midnight hour
I know you'll shine on through
I promised myself

I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers
You made my dreams come true

How many of us out there
Feel the need to run
And look for shelter?

I promised myself
That I'd say a prayer for you
A brand new tomorrow
Where all you wish comes true

I promised myself
That I'd make it up to you
My sister and brother
Know I'm in love with you

How many of us out there
Feel the pain of losing
What was once there?

God I know what people
Say about her
No mistake who can live
Without love

In the midnight hour
I will wait for you
I will wait for you
I will wait for you

Start up happy and end up sad days
Talking about that Murphy's law chill

Friday night and I had the munchies
Filled the cart till it could not take it
One more bag of chips would break it

Went to the cheek out stood in line
Behind me a girl who was just too fine
Got in the ear while they rang the total
Reached for my wallet uh oh a bolo

Not my day I felt like a dummy
Went to the store and forgot the money

Oops up inside your head
Oops up inside your head
Say oops up

Me and amy under the covers
Scene is hot potential lovers
Demon in the sack is her reputation
In school then she is graduation

Touching holding heavy breathing
I knew I'd get it she is not about teasing
Left on the light so I could see reaction
Amy is a freak guaranteed satisfaction

She is soft as bubble bath
I am as hard as chinese math
Ready for the ultimate affection
Took out a pack obtain my protection

Rolled it on one hard stroke
It was my last and yes it broke

Oops up inside your head
Say oops up

It's so hot in here, oh

I'm in over my head
Fire fills me, hot and red
Raging like a blood red sun
Fire fuelled by deeds undone
Burning and I just can't wait to give a helping hand to fate
Change this crazy world around, first we gotta cool down

Take me dancing naked in the rain
Feel it washing over me, oh oh
Join me dancing naked in the rain
Cover me in ecstasy, oh

Oh oh

Smoke is in my eyes
Drifting from the burning cries
Of those who have no strength to stand
Against the fire in the land
Come and wash away the pain, step into the blessed rain
Cool the fire in your soul, the rain will make you whole

In no time you'll be fine
Don't worry...

You met a guy he said he was your lover
He said he loved you like no other
Told you that you were the only one
How could he say that when he's having so much fun
Now he says you're making him said
How he says that when he treats you so bad
Now he's gone left you for another
You're not the first you now discover

Don't you cry you'll get by you'll be back
On your feet in no time you'll be fine don't worry
You got hurt you got heard you're not the first
Your heart aches it won't last it will pass don't worry

Don't waste your time thinking of the past
Love like that it could never last girl
Don't you know things happen for a reason
It's meant to be just like the change of seasons
You're not to blame don't you feel so bad
He was the one who was making you sad
Now he's gone left you for another
It's for the best you will discover

Don't you cry you'll get by you'll be back
On your feet in no time you'll be fine don't worry
You got hurt you got heard you're not the first
Your heart aches it won't last it will pass don't worry

Standing all on my own love will never be the same without him
Trying hard to be strong how can I go on now he's gone

Don't worry… don't worry…

16,I can't stand it,Streetmoves (Album),Twenty 4 Seven,1989,249412,38,"

Wake up, wake up, better stand up
We know what time it is, we better stop
If you care for you life, pay attention
But even if you don't I wanna mention
Have fun and have a good time
Make the best of life and do it fine
But you gotta think
You know you gotta behave, cause...

Just take it easy when you go
Cause there's time enough for the show
Don't forget the feeling of romance
Even though your mind is in trance
Don't be mislead by vision
Cause it's more that just a decision
It is a rule and a new way of living
And it's the only chance that is given

Nothing's wrong is dreaming
About the way your life used to be
But let me tell you life is beaming
Just look around and you'll see
Get with it and stick with the program
Don't take the risk if you can
I believe it's more than just a wave, and ...

Can we try, try to make a new life
Let's start right now, don't jive

I'm gonna be number one in proving
That I think before I start moving
Let's get it right, don't hesitate
Don't wait to long cause it's late
And if you know there's danger baby
It is guarantee, no maybe
Bang! An explosion
Can you feel the vibe and it's strong
Bang! Bang! That's the notion
Taking care of life can't be wrong
Keep on loving, cause it's good
And standing tall is brave
I really hope that you understood, that...

Oh let it go through your body
Oh let it go through your soul
Oh if you wanna dance with somebody
Yhere's one thing you should know

Do you know
What you can do if you want to?
Do you know
Don't let your mind run free
Do you know
Better be safe than sorry
Do you know
That is the one for me

Here's a little story and you're sure to like it
Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool
With my home girl, Paula Abdul

Baby, it seems we never ever agree
You like the movies and I like TV
I take things serious and you take 'em light
I go to bed early and I party all night

[Verse 2: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
Our friends are sayin' we ain't gonna last
'Cause I move slowly and baby, I'm fast
I like it quiet and I love to shout
But when we get together, it just all works out

I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

Who'd-a thought we could be lovers?
She makes the bed and he steals the covers
She likes it neat and he makes a mess
I take it easy, baby, I get obsessed

[Verse 4: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
She's got the money and he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes and I like to smoke
Things in common? There just ain't a one!
But when we get together, we have nothin' but fun

[Chorus: Paula Abdul, The Wild Pair, Both]
I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract
A two steps forward, a two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact
We come together 'cause opposites attract

[Breakdown: Paul Abdul and The Wild Pair]
You know it, baby, baby
We come together
We come together

[Verse 5: Paula Abdul & The Wild Pair]

You and me provin' everyone wrong
Don't think we'll ever get our differences patched
Don't really matter 'cause we're perfectly matched

I take two steps forward, I take two steps back
We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact

Every man has a place
In his heart there's a space
And the world can't erase his fantasies

Take a ride in the sky
On our ship fantasize
All your dreams will come true right away

And we will live together
Until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever as one

Come to see victory
In a land called fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To behold to your soul is ecstasy

You will find other kind
That has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to recognize
It's your life now in review

Every thought is a dream
Rushing by in a stream
Bringing life to your kingdom of doing

Take a ride in the sky
On our ship fantasize
All your dreams will come true miles away

Our voices will ring together
Until the twelfth of never
We all will live on forever as one

Come to see victory
In the land of fantasy
Loving life a new decree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

As you stay for the play
Fantasy has in store for you
Glowing light will see you through
It's your day, shining day
All your dreams come true

As you glide in your stride
With the wind as you fly away
Give a smile from your lips and say
I am free, yes I'm free
Now I'm on my way

You just want to forget me
Why don't you come and get me?

And, boy, I really miss you
And all I wanna do is kiss you
I've used up all my tissues

I don't even know the reason
You were playin' and you were teasin'
Did they tell me you were leavin'?
Those good looks are deceivin' (Oooh, oooh, oooh)

This is too much for me to handle
Already caused a scandal
A disturbance like a vandal

I've lost track of all time
'Cause you're always on my mind
And you're just that type of guy
That'll make me cry, oh why, oh why, oh why

Oh, why has he disappeared?

You've really got a nerve
And all you wanna do is flirt
Love is just a word
That you tell to all your birds

Does it give you any satisfaction
To see the worst of one's reaction
And this has never happened
It's my first love attraction

And what did I do to deserve this?
Some days I feel all nervous
Please use the telephone service
I hope today you hear this (Oooh, oooh, oooh)

How did it feel to be alone

Trying to make the best of my time

But only love can break your heart

But if your world should fall apart

I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Someone should call him and see if he can come out
Try to lose the down that he's found

But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
But if your world should fall apart

[Intro]
Yo, Vanilla. Kick it one time, boy!

Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy

I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell
In ecstasy in the back of me
Well that's my DJ D-Shay cuttin' all them Z's
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy

I'm lettin' my drug kick in
It controls my mouth and I begin
To just let it flow, let my concepts go
My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go!

Smooth cause that's the way I will be
And if you don't give a damn, then
Why you starin' at me
So get off cause I control the stage
There's no dissin' allowed
I'm in my own phase
The girlies say they love me and that is ok
And I can dance better than any Kid 'N Play

Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music, white boy I can't hear you, say it
Play that funky music say it, say it, say
Play that funky music, white boy it, come on
Yea, a little bit louder
Now come on, come on

Stage 2—Yea the one ya' wanna listen to
It's off my head so let the beat play through
So I can funk it up and make it sound good
1-2-3 Yo—Knock on some wood
For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious
Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
I'm an effect and that you can bet
I can take a fly girl and make her wet

I'm like Samson—Samson to Delilah
There's no denyin', You can try to hang
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style
Over and over, practice makes perfect
But not if you're a loafer

You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls
Soon—Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat
Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music white boy Let's do it

VIP. Vanilla Ice yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino
Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino
So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin'
Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin'
Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along
All through the ghetto groovin' this here song
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse

Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi
Startled by the bases hittin' ground
There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down
Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic
You trapped me once and I thought that
You might have it
So step down and lend me your ear
'89 is my time! Yo, '90 is my year
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, I
Play that funky music white boy can't hear you

You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it
Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it
So don't be mad and don't be sad
Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure
So come up close and don't be square
You wanna battle me—Anytime, anywhere

You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong
So come on, everybody and sing this song

Say—Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go
Play that funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go
Lay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear
Play that funky music white boy you say it, say it
Play that funky music A little louder now
Play that funky music, white boy Come on, Come on, Come on
Play that funky music

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee!

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh!

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
Hoo!

Hoo!
Gone withca girl!

I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee-hee!

But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

[Verse 1]
One two, tell me what you got
Let me slip my quarters inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up, rev me up my little buttercup
We can tug sheets snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not, here comes the brother with glow
A strugglin', bubblin' overweight lover hug pro
So what's it gonna be, me or the TV
Now let me take time to set your mind and your body free
So why don't you just stretch stretch for a sec
Lay down your problems so I can cop a quick wreck
Shake me, shake me baby Baby bake me
No need to fake here I am come on and take me
Wind your body baby move your body
I see you slip sliding come on and do it hottie
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling hunky–dory about this thing that I found

[Chorus]
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

[Verse 2]
I like the way you wiggle you don't jingle, but you jiggle
So spread open your love cause it's Heavy in the middle
Move it like a mover she wanted to groove so I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn so we played school and I schooled her
(Mary had a little lamb) But not like this
We can toss and turn, rumble, tumble and twist
Anything you want, I'll give it fantasies we'll live it
So lay down and relax, lover, my lady
Lady lover, my baby girl
Spread your wings so we can fly around the world
Harmony, charming me your fingertips are calming me
When you dropped the kisses, Suzie Q, you dropped the bomb on me
Stretch it, stretch it, flex it, flex it
Gimme the permission okey-dokey I'll bless it
Bless it like buddha, buddha has to bless
We can lay down after loving put your head on my chest

[Chorus]
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

[Verse 3]
What can we do what are we gonna do
Roses are red and violets are blue
Love is good and plenty if you get plenty good lovin'
Kiss you where you're hot give what I got to keep you bubblin'
Do me right, do me right my lonesome dove
Tell ya man one time what is this thing called love
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feelin' hunky–dory about this thing I found

[Chorus]
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it

[Outro]
Here we go, keep it funky
Put your hands together, y'all come on
Bring it back one time
All up in money earning Mount Vernon
This one's dedicated to you
Know what I'm saying
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Manhattan
The whole New York City
I said I love ya to death
And ya don't stop
Ya don't quit, ya gotta keep on
Until the d-d-do it like this
Ya don't stop, ya don't quit
Ya gotta keep on and on and on

Yeah
Alright
Oh yeah

I'm crazy flowing over with ideas
A thousand ways to woo a lover so sincere?
Love and hate what a beautiful combination
Sending shivers up and down my spine

For every Casanova that appears
My sense of hesitation disappears
Love and hate what a beautiful combination
Sending shivers up and down my spine

And the lovers that you sent for me
Didn't come with any satisfaction guarantee
So I return them to the sender
And the note attached will read
How I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you

Oh you really still expect me to believe
Every single letter I receive
Sorry you what a shameful situation
Sending shivers up and down my spine

Oh I like to read murder mystery
I like to know the killer isn't me
Love and hate what a beautiful combination
Sending shivers make me quiver
Feel it sliver up and down my spine

And the lovers that you sent for me
Didn't come with any satisfaction guarantee
So I return them to the sender
And the note attached will read
How I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you
I love to hate you

People might misunderstand what we're tryin' to say, you know?
(No, but that's a part of life)
Come on

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

[Verse 1]
Let's talk about sex for now
To the people at home or in the crowd
It keeps coming up anyhow
Don't be coy, avoid, or make void the topic
Cause that ain't gonna stop it
Now we talk about sex on the radio and video shows
Many will know, anything goes
Let's tell it like it is, and how it could be
How it was, and of course, how it should be
Those who think it's dirty have a choice
Pick up the needle, press pause, or turn the radio off
Will that stop us, Pep? I doubt it
All right then, come on, Spin

Let's talk about sex, baby

Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be

Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

Hot to trot, make any man's eyes pop
She use what she got to get whatever she don't got
Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'
Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates, heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag so she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope

[Bridge 1]
Oh, hey, ooh, ooh, ooh, take it easy now
Uh, alright

[Chorus 2]
Let's talk about sex, baby (Sing it)
Let's talk about you and me (Sing it, sing it)
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex (Come on)
Let's talk about sex (Do it)
Let's talk about sex (Uh-huh)
Let's talk about sex

[Bridge 2]
Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies, let's talk about sex, all right
Come on, all the ladies, let's talk about sex, all right
Yo, Pep, I don't think they're gonna play this on the radio
(And why not? Everybody has sex)
I mean, everybody should be makin' love
(Come on, how many guys you know make love?)

[Chorus 1]
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

[Verse 3]
What we have here is subject to controversy
A three-letter word some regard as a curse, see
He may fiend and have a wet dream
Because he seen a teen in tight jeans
What makes him react like that is biological
But scheme of gettin' in those jeans, is diabolical
But of course he does it, and she gives him rap
And before you even know it, they jump in the sack
As a matter of fact, sometimes it’s like that
But anyway, ready or not, here he cums
And like a dumb son-of-a-gun, oops, he forgot the condoms
“Oh well,” you say, “what the hell, it’s chill
I won’t get got, I’m on the pill""
Until the sores start to puff and spore
He gave it to you, and now it’s yours

[Chorus 1]
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

[Intro]
Drums Please!

[Chorus]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 1]
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

[Chorus]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 2]
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

[Chorus]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 3]
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kissed
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

[Chorus]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Chorus]
Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow

[Verse 1]
Life's too short to make a mistake
Let's think of each other and hesitate
Young and impatient we may be
There's no need to act foolishly
If we part our hearts won't forget it
Years from now we'll surely regret it

[Chorus]
Give me just a little more time (Give me just a little more time)
And our love will surely grow (Give me just a little more time)
Give me just a little more time (Give me just a little more time)
And our love will surely grow (Give me just a little more time)

[Verse 2]
You're young and you're in a hurry
You're eager for love but don't you worry
We both want the sweetness in life
But these things don't come overnight
Don't give up 'cause love's been slow
Boy, we're gonna succeed with another blow

[Chorus]
Give me just a little more time (Give me just a little more time)
And our love will surely grow (Give me just a little more time)
Baby, please, baby (Give me just a little more time)
Baby, please, baby (Give me just a little more time)

[Bridge]
Love is that mountain we must climb
Let's climb it together your hand in mine
We haven't known each other too long
But the feeling I have is oh so strong
I know we can make it, there's no doubt
We owe it to ourselves to find it out

[Chorus]
Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Give me just a little more time (Give me just a little more time)
And our love will surely grow (Give me just a little more time)
Give me just a little more time (Give me just a little more time)
And our love will surely grow (Give me just a little more time)
Baby, please, baby (Give me just a little more time)
Baby, please, baby (Give me just a little more time)
Give me just a little more time (Give me just a little more time)
And our love will surely grow (Give me just a little more time)
Give me just a little more time (Give me just a little more time)
And our love will surely grow (Give me just a little more time)
Give me just a little more time (Give me just a little more time)
And our love will surely grow (Give me just a little more time)

I'm crucified, crucified like my savior
Saintlike behavior, a lifetime I prayed
I'm crucified, for the holy dimension
Godlike ascension, Heaven's away
I've seen the deepest darkness
And wrestled with gods
Ride the noble harness
Raining cats and dogs
I stand before my maker
Like Moses on the hill
My Guiness record baker
I abide your will
The first of reciters
I saw eternal light
Best of vocal fighters
Beyond human sight
Where thorns are a teaser
I've played a double jeux
Yherushalaim at easter
I cry I pray mon dieu
I cry I pray mon dieu
I'm crucified, crucified like my savior
Saintlike behavior, a lifetime I prayed
I'm crucified, for the holy dimension
Godlike ascension, Heaven's away
Prophets I've been reading
Stories I've been told
Before I end my breathing
I travel in the soul
Where thorns are a teaser
I've played a double jeux
Yherushalaim at easter
I cry I pray mon dieu
I cry I pray mon dieu
I cry I pray mon dieu
Adieu mon dieu
I'm crucified, crucified like my savior
Saintlike behavior, a lifetime I prayed
I'm crucified, for the holy dimension
Godlike ascension, Heaven's away

I will not fail nor falter I shall succeed
My perception is altered I do believe
Faith is so strong now nothing shall bar my way
Firm conviction is no fiction this is my day

I can move move move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain

I walk so tall ascending I stand so high
Earth below me revolving above the sky
I feel no fear to be here is oh so fine
Shining brightly like sunlight inside my mind

Well you know that any mountain is capable of moving
The shamen and the new generation who are proving
You can be what you want to be
Let your soul and your body and your mind be free
One of a kind, we are all that
And going all the way is where I'm at
With delivery smooth like water from a fountain
That's why I can move any mountain move any mountain

I can move move move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain
Move any mountain
Move any mountain
Move any mountain

Future feeling new sensation
Body is rockin' and the mind is reeling
And rolling racing changing motion
Flowing like a river into the ocean
Better get yourself ready for the next transition
'Cause the time is right for a new vibration
My vision one nation one tribe
One day'll come the might to move any mountain
Move any mountain
Move any mountain
I can move move move any mountain

I walk so tall ascending I stand so high
Earth below me revolving above the sky
I feel no fear to be here is oh so fine
Shining brightly like sunlight inside my mind

I can move move move any mountain

I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

[Verse 2]
In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind
And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine
It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

[Bridge]
You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

Jet black Benz, plenty of friends
And all the Philly steaks you can eat

[Verse 2: Wanya & (Shawn)]
Back in school
We used to dream about this every day
Could it really happen?
Or do dreams just fade away?
Then we started singing and
They said it sounds smooth
And we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you

[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Chorus]
Jam
It ain’t, It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t too much
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t, don't you

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
Cause it aren’t too hard to

68,Treat 'Em Right,The One,Chubb Rock,1991-05-10,283306,47,"

[Verse One]
Nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene
With a lean and a pocket full of green
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
But Robocop last year was a shock
The tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt
Kids are screaming; the media says, ""What...
Kind of music is this for you to dance to?""
The man with the plan and the man demands you
Leave the smack and the crack for the wack
Throw the vial in the Nile; keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store
And ignore temptation, sent by the nation
Racial gain causes pain; need a new rep
In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef
Hawkins, and when you're walking, you don't just run
Black on black; remember that; it's important
Anyway the struggle is won, brings forth the fun
No hatred; the summer's almost done
No time for sleep, jump in your Jeep
And pump up the funky beat a whole week
Beeper goes off, yo, smash it and trash it
You're too young to be plumped in a casket
Just get your boys and bring the noise
And just swing it, and party people, sing it

[Chorus]
Treat me right, I'll treat you good

[Verse Two]
Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man
""Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam?
I'm his number one fan, yes I am""
All these kids realize that I'm the man
Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger
Than last year, but still a unique figure
Rob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky, and Hot Dog know
That I'm a man who was born to have a mic on
Next to me at all times, ready to kick a rhyme
That will keep me out of financial bind
That's why when it comes to fans, I'm never mean
Kids on St. James between Gates and Greene
Always says hello, cause I'm a modest fellow
Never try to play a superstar, that's hollow
Cause if these kids don't go buy our records
We'll be has-beens, and plus naked
So we owe them, so pull out your pen
Sign an autograph, you might make a new friend
So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people in the house, sing it

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Party people in the house, listen up
I'm the man with the plan and the band rips it up
Peace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee
Swinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ed Lover, Dinky
Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips
Before the tune ends, give me some lips (ah!)
Sanity Crystal, my niece
And Lady Kazam, my homegirl, peace
And leave the guns and have fun; out!
And oh yeah, sing it

[Chorus]

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse Four]
Well, coming back
To nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene
With a lean and a hardcore dream
The dream wasn't crafted to be pornographic
Decency started from the crib, plus kids
Don't need to hear all of that on the rap
The strength of my vibe placed Chubbs on the map
Cause authority, seniority goes far
My staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs
Read my mic, heed my sight, I'll definitely lead you right
Just treat me right, peace!

[Outro]
Treat me right
Treat me right
Treat me right

And what about love? Love's a possibility
But let's make sure we share the same mentality
Close the door, dim the lights
Everything is okey-dokey, cos we set it alright
And how bout oil? Warm from the heat
I can slick ya body down from your head to your feet
Make ya smile from a simple kiss
Close your eyes and I'll grant your first wish
Open your arms and wrap me tight like a teddy bear
Then take your fingers and run it thru my hair
Many will call but the chosen are few
But all I wanna know, is it good to you?

Hello Nigeria! That's my Motherland
Coming to Sweden now causin' a hysteria
Takes a long time to travel the globe, so why be shy?
Why be humble? I just came straight out the jungle
You can't compete with me 'cause you know I got the rhythm

I did it before and I'll do it again, so listen watcha say
Yeah hear my point of view
Not everyone can do this
In fact only a few sophisticated, hardcreated
That's who I am, and you knowI've been waiting
So start pumping make some noise

The Mandika tribe, the Hausa tribe
The Fulani tribe, the Gooya tribe, the Zulu tribe
Mi no live in a house mi live in a tree
Electricity can give you a shock
Mi no smoke no cig mi no take no coke
All me take is a glass of juice

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'

I'm calling on the big guys from the pyramid top
To join the bits and pieces of our Fatherland Africa
'Cause without boundaries we can move the mountains
Drop your personal individual ambitions
Chase the devil off and purify our Fatherland

Afrikan people, crawl from your vultures
Stand affirm 'cause you are the aura of the mankind
You are the dreams, you are the hope, you are the future
You are the past, you are the grandfather of civilization
That is why A N C wants old dogs to sit

The impossible just takes a little longer
Out of this world and inta another world
The earth is spinning round and there's so much to discover
The African man seems to be everywhere
If there are people in the world
Who knows that right is never wrong
Stop the fire burning in my home Africa

Martin Luther King, Mandela you had a dream
Self evidence and a quality for men
Africa for me and Africa far you de Klerk
It doesn't really matter whether a cat is black or white
What really matter is to catch the mouse
I'd rather do it in an African way
Hello Africa tell me you you're doin'

Mmm, jumping on the mike, it 'cause me a rockin' up affection
When I'm holdin' me a mike, it 'cause me awesome affections
What you say to me, me a fun and me warm
Spend some me a time on the Tresittia dime
Don't you try to follow me you ought to realize what me are
What me a really want, me not fly
No I am just coolin', come on now just set it off

Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Africa! Tell me how you're doin'
Hello Motherland! Tell me how you're doin'

I have been mourning, I have been grieving
I have been crying, no more tears in my eyes
There's a hottie, hottie wind blowing south to north
Following my head, drying all my plants
If there's a mercy in the clouds
You know right is never wrong

Move the sadist off my back
And stop the fire burning in my home Africa
Here comes the news from the mighty Lord
Transqualation is about to come to Earth
Right, rapping is digging down river, north to south
To let milk and honey flow side to side

My name is Alban, mi is a dentist, mi DJ here, mi DJ there
Mi have a shop on Slojdgatan, Alphabet St. is da name
Mi live in no house, mi live in a flat. electricity can give you a shock
Mi smoke no cig, mi take no coke, all me takes is a glass of juice

In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, ""I love you so, I'll never let you go""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time?
('Cause I remember)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)

(Remember the time)
Hoo!
(Remember the time)
Do you remember, girl?
(Remember the time)
On the phone, you and me
(Remember the time)
Till dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach
(Remember the time)
You and me, in Spain
What about, what about
(Remember the time)
Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat
Grrrrrat, tat tat

CHORUS:
Everybody in the house of love
Everybody in the house of love
One love, one God
Everybody in the house of love

We've got to stop the pain, and put the wars on hold
Let the power of love, inside the soul unfold
Free the mind, let it rise above
We've got to change this world to a world of love
Mother Earth she's on overload
One more war and she might explode
We've got to look back and see a love from the past
We've got the time to change it but it's running out fast

BRIDGE:
Not bothered about your colour, concerned about your creed
In the house of love, everybody's free
Not bothered about your colour, concerned about your creed
In the house of love, everybody's free

CHORUS x2

How many more tears must she cry
How many more fears must be felt inside
Before we realise we're going too far
The Creator created, we tore it apart
But love can guide us back to the right road
We gotta save the planet, before she explodes
We've got to love our mother gotta let her know
Boom, boom, before she blows

Not bothered about religion, not bothered about belief
In the house of love, everybody's free
Not bothered about religion, not bothered about belief
In the house of love, everybody's free

CHORUS x2

Born to live, we live to die
Our eyes can't see they can only cry
But our mother's tired of crying, she's had enough
She's gonna surely blow, 'cause we're giving up
Build the house of love while we've got the time
Too many bombs in a world it's like a living mine
The house of love is what we must build
The past won't lost if the present is killed!

I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering

For the people, for the good
For mankind brotherhood
(We’re traveling in time)

[Verse 1]
Ideas by man and only that will last
And over time we’ve learned from the past
That no man’s fit to rule the world alone
A man will die but not his ideas

[Chorus]
Happy nation living in a happy nation
Where the people understand
And dream of the perfect man
Situation lead to sweet salvation
For the people, for the good
For mankind brotherhood
(We’re traveling in time)

[Verse 2]
(Traveling in time)
Tell them we’ve gone too far
Tell them we’ve gone too far
(Happy nation)
Come through and I will dance with you
(Happy nation)
Tell them we’ve gone too far
(Happy nation)
Come through and I will dance with you
(Happy nation)
Tell them we’ve gone too far
Come through and I will dance with you

[Chorus]
Happy nation living in a happy nation
Where the people understand
And dream of the perfect man
Situation lead to sweet salvation
For the people, for the good
For mankind brotherhood

[Outro]
Happy nation
Happy nation
Happy nation
Happy nation

She says the love me could never die
But that will change if she ever found out
About you and I

Oh - but her love is cold
It wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, 'cause...

When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run to you
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you
She's got a heart of gold she'd never let me down
But you're the one that always turns me on
You keep me comin' 'round

I know her love is true
But it's so damn easy makin' love to you

I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch

I'm gonna run to you
Ya - I'm gonna run to you
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night

I'm gonna run to you
Ya - I'm gonna run to you
Oh when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night

Waiting for your interview

Now winter's gonna turn to spring
And you haven't accomplished a thing
So baby can't you make me just a little time
Cause you never know what's on my mind

[Intro: Girls]
""Oh, my, god, Becky, look at her butt. It is so big. She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends. Who understands those rap guys? They only talk to her, because she looks like a total prostitute, okay? I mean, her butt, it's just so big. Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross. Look! She's just so black!""

[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She sweat, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
Baby got back!

[Verse 2: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *moan*
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
Baby got back!

""Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"".""

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

[Outro]
Baby got back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!

When you trust someone
And you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trustin' about you
And you claim that you
Don't care what where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you

[Pre-Chorus: Bobby Brown]
Say you trust someone
Why are you calling all around
Think I've got some dip on the side
Girl, you don't trust no one
And you're constantly in doubt
You lose the game if you play that way

And you wanna love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
And you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you

Say that you love someone
Why you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl, you don't love no one

Maybe, baby, take control of ya just like I told ya
I wanna roll
On the tip that's smooth and
Gonna make ya move and groove and
Leaves ya like ""ooh"" when I touch ya
Give ya so much of
The feeling of the deck that I'm dealin'
When I rub ya up and down
Yo Stylz, kick it

[Verse 5: Stylz]
Well, I know it's been a while
Since you heard a change in a style
So what I'm gonna do is kick in something fly and new
A change, this one from the typical
A bit more than regular, I'm not like the others, original
'Cause originality and creativity
Added up together equals the BBB Posse
Yeah, we in the house, yo, kick it

Get up off my back (Come on)

And you said you trust me
Why you think I'm foolin' around?
I can't stand the pressure
You know I'm yours forever
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody humpin' around, baby

[Produced by Mark Morales & Mark C. Rooney]

[Verse 1]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I’ve been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won’t you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I’m not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

[Bridge]
Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I’ll find
A real love

[Verse 3]
So I’ve tried my best and prayed to God he’ll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love

[Bridge]
See, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
(Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love

[Intro]
You can just—
Walk on
Keep on
You can just go, walk on, keep on
You can just go, walk on, keep on

[Verse 1]
Sittin', waitin', anticipatin', waitin' for your call
Tossin', turnin', my heart's burnin' from the things I saw
I'm sorry, baby, you can't play me, I just can't be used
I'm so fed up, time to get up, baby, we are through

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that what we had would never end
But now it's too late for my heart to mend
And although what we had was good
I've got to make this understood

[Chorus]
Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin to ya anymore (You can just go)
Keep on walkin', keep on walkin' (Keep on walkin')
Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin to ya anymore (You can just go)
Keep on walkin', keep on walkin' (We ain't talkin' no more)

[Verse 2]
I thought I told ya it was over, why are you confused?
You made your choice and now I'm voicin' my opinion to you
I think you're crazy to try to play me for a foolish girl
You'll soon discover you're not the only lover in this world

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that what we had would never end
But now it's too late for my heart to mend
And although what we had was good
I've got to make this understood

[Post-Chorus]
You— You can just walk on
You— You can just keep on

I thought that what we had would never end
Now it's too late, my heart won't mend
And although what we had was good
Got to make this understood

I know it's just too late
I know, I know, I know
I know it's just too late

Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin to ya anymore (You can just—)

There is something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me, don't hide our love
Woman to man

She's just a lover who's doing me by
It's worth the giving, it's worth the try
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it

You can't neglect it, you can't abuse it
It's just desire, you cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it

The truth of lust to woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free
Oh, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby (Oh)
Just promise me whenever we say (And we get it)
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow (Never knew)
To just keep it in the closet

[Verse 3]
If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's aching, you have to rub it

She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it

She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it

Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move, cast the spell
Oh, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or do to each other (Whatever we do)
For now we'll make a vow
To just keep it in the closet
Because there's something about you, baby

We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?

We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

[Intro]
Hit it!
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA!

[Verse 1]
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William, but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if
He's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Verse 2]
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Bridge]
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
Cars
The sun and the moon but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party's just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I can’t put my love on the line, that I hope you’ll understand

What I really need is somebody who will always be there
Don’t you promise me the world, all that I’ve already heard
This time around for me baby, actions speak louder than words

If you’re looking for devotion, talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed

[Chorus]
So baby if you want me
You’ve got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, alright?
You’ve got to show me love

[Bridge]
Show me, show me baby
Show me, show me baby
Show me, show me baby
Show me, show me baby

Heartbreaks and promises, I’ve had more than my share
I’m tired of giving my love and getting nowhere, nowhere
What I really need is somebody who will always be there
This time around for me baby, actions speak louder than words

If you’re looking for devotion, talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed

[Chorus]
So baby if you want me
You’ve got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, alright?
You’ve got to show me love

There’s nothing that you can tell me
You’ve got to show me love
There’s only one key to my heart
You’ve got to show me love

Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him Mr. Vain

Call him Mr. Raider
Call him Mr. Wrong
Call him insane

He'd say: I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain
I know what I want
And I want it now
I want you, cause I'm Mr. Vain

[Verse 1: Jay Supreme]
Call me raider, call me wrong
Call me insane, call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like
As long as you call me, time and again
Feel the presence of the aura
Of the man, none to compare
Loveless dying
For a chance just to touch a hand
Or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge, that makes them
Want to lose themselves to the debonair one
Hold me back, the simple fact is
That I'm all that, and I'm always near
One sexy can't perplex me
Now you know who's raw
As if you didn't know before
I know what I want, and I want it now
I want you, and then I want a little more

[Verse 2: Jay Supreme]
Girls all over the world
They hope, and pray, and die for men like me
Cause I'm the one, begotten son
That breaks the mold, get a look at male epitome
Style has never seen
That makes you want to grab, and hold, and squeeze real tight
Who's gonna be the one to save you from yourself
When you wanna take a bite
Please, oh baby, please
You beg, you want to stay, you got to get some
Caught up in the charm, that I laid on thick
And now there's nowhere to run
Just another fish to pick the worm on the hook of my line
Yeah, I keep many
Females longing for a chance to win my heart
With S.E.X. and plenty

You always wanted a lover
I only wanted a job
I've always worked for a living
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?

I come here looking for money
(Got to have it)
And end up living with love, oh, oh
Now you left me with nothing
(Can't take it)
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?

I bought you drinks I brought you flowers
I read you books and talked for hours
Every day so many drinks
Such pretty flowers, so tell me
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I...

Since you went away I've been hanging around
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
But I don't know, oh
How I'm gonna get through?
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)
How I'm gonna get through?
(What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?)

You always wanted me to be something I wasn't
You always wanted too much, oh
Now I can do what I want to - forever
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?

At night the people come and go
They talk too fast and walk too slow
Chasing time from hour to hour
I pour the drinks and crush the flowers
What have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I...

Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter

[Chorus]
I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Verse 1]
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
That's what my mama told me
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
When you find love, you'll always know
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)

Think with your heart, not with your head
That's what my mama told me
All the little things you do
Will end up coming back to you
I let my father mold me

Daddy couldn't be all wrong
(Not gonna let you slip away, I'm gonna be there)

I can't help falling in love
I fall deeper and deeper the further I go
Kisses sent from heaven above
They get sweeter and sweeter the more that I know

[Bridge]
Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

[Instrumental Break]

Daddy couldn't be all wrong

Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
You've got to just let your body move to the music
You've got to just let your body go with the flow

Sometimes I get to thinking. While you are far away
Just how much I miss you and how time it ticks away
So sad when we are fighting, too much tension too much hate
Sometimes I need reminding, before it gets too late
Just one moment in my day. Take me up to a place
So far away in your heavenly space

Chorus-Heather Small:
One night (one night),hmm one night in heaven. When you touch me
You take me up high with the clouds in the sky
One night (one night),ooh one night in heaven. When you kiss me
You light up my life, make me feel so alive

While people create problems, lie cheat in vain
Come lay with me in my bed and wash away the pain
Take me on a journey let the pleasure start
Take me on a journey that leads straight to your heart
Just one look I can see in your face, yeah
You're my love satellite in orbit with you. Such a beautiful place

When the time grew near
For me to show my love
The longer I stayed away for
Hiding from a word I need to hear now
Don't think I'll hear it again (don't think I'll hear it again)

[Pre-Chorus]
But the nights were always warm with you
Holding you right by my side (right by my side)
But the morning always comes too soon
Before I even close my eyes (close my eyes)

[Chorus]
All I do each night is pray
Hoping that I'll be a part of you again some day
All I do each night is think
Of all the times I closed the door to keep my love within

[Verse 2]
If you can't forgive the past
I'll understand that
Can't understand why I did this to you
And all of the days and the nights so I regret it
I never showed you my love (I never showed you my love)

But the nights were always warm with you (my love)
Holding you right by my side (right by my side)

Of the dream we long to live (we long to live)
If you stop and close your eyes
You'll picture me inside
I'm so cold and all alone

Right in the night, a sweet thing is what you get
When you fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love with music, fall in love with dance
Fall in love with anything that makes you want romance
Make a little soft on the way that you go
Just think that everything you touch can turn to gold
Fall in love with everything that you'd love to love
You know that laughter is a kind form to wake you up
So don't make me feel unpleasant like you do
You know that everything will fall right back on you
So fall in love with everything, fall in love with life
Forget about your troubles and be a little nice
You will not see me if you don't wanna look
Just come and get me in my big, big bed of love
Big, big bed of love
So fall in love with stories, fairy tales of truth
Innocence is part of what you lose with you youth
Show a little confidence, and show a little class
Don't kiss the past, the past ain't gonna last
Just fall in love with passion, fall in love with lust
Fall in love with all the things you're dreaming of
Fall in love with music

Hard to see the light as anything but a train
Is passion out of fashion
Am I on the wrong track
Hard for me to take
But can you tell what I lack
Been the early bird but I gets no worm
Treat me like a germ
But I still stand firm
Chasing am I
Wasting all my time on the cause
Do you want a break
Or do you need a pause
Never knew no one like you
That is never impressed
Is it how I'm dressed, huh
Or am I just a pest
I think you bend me
Just to see if I will break
Evasion from the case
Just to see what I will take
Lead me, lead me on

Dirty mind is in effect
Rigorous and vigorous
How you turn my neck
Heated now I'm hotter
For your hips, put me on
Sweat ya in the eve
Sweat ya in the morn
Yearning, yeah, I'm yearning
Got an itch, need a scratch
Money I can make
But it's hard to make a match
Craving what you're saying
Waiting for your will to cave in
Read me like a book
I'm misbehaving
Tell me what you need
And your need I'll try to feed
Hear me as I beg
Hear me as I plead
Runaway, run all day
But you can't hide
I see you're fighting feelings
That you feel inside
Tell me what you want
And I'll tell you what I'll bring
The question from the King

I'll be right there for you

[Verse 2]
You say all the things, that I like to hear
You push all my buttons, baby
Love to have you close to me
Wanna feel your love, wanna be for sure
That it's me you need, baby, each and every night

[Pre-Chorus]
If I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide
Will you be there for me when I need someone to hold?
Baby, don't misunderstand, I do want you for my man
I just need a little time before I invest my love

[Chorus]
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away, boy)
My love won't hurt you (No)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
I'll be right there for you

[Bridge]
Baby, don't misunderstand
I want you for my man
I need a little time
Before I give you my love
(Don't walk away, boy) Don't walk away
(I'll be right there for you)

Don't walk away

This is what it sounds like when we make love
(Don't walk away, boy)
(Don't walk away, boy)
(I'll be right there for you)

Don't walk away

[Chorus]
Don't walk away, boy (No)
My love won't hurt you (Won't hurt you)
Don't walk away, boy
I'll be right there for you (I'll be right there, oh yeah)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (No)

What do those faces tell you?

[R:] Faces, joy and pain

[A:] Faces
All around different faces I see
Some are happy, some in misery
They express joy and pain
No two faces are the same

[R:] People, people all over town
Some of them are poor and others wear a crown
I've seen a lot of many faces
Joy and pain in different places
Open your mind, set yourself free
Figure it out, what could it be?
Sympathise, understand
Give love and peace to the other fellow man

[A:] Faces
[R:] Faces, joy and pain

Some are happy, some in misery
They express joy and pain
No two faces are the same

[R:] Playing with your life, playing with your soul
You all scream out ""I'm the one in control""
Killing of the colours, silly stupid games
You know who you are without no names
Don't mess the world cause that the sequal
Open your mind cause we talking about the people
In the world, all kind of places
Different races, different faces

Gimme the one
Gimme the one
Gimme the one that I'm asking for
You lie and you cheat and you fall on your feat
You know I ain't gonna take no more
I wish you could see in your heart to tell me
I wish you'd told me from the start
And let it all out
Get it all out
Tell me what you want from me

Whenever I try to communicate
I see you looking for the door
You find an excuse to be with you friends
You know it don't wanna stay at home
Why can't you be good, like a real lover would
And be faithful to me, never deceiving
And let it all out
Get it all out

Pour it all out to me

Ooo, Ooo, Ooo, Ooo

Well there ain't no love then there ain't no use
Gonna walk on by, gonna walk on through
If there ain't no love, then there ain't no use
Gonna walk on by, gonna walk on through

Well there ain't no love then there ain't no use
Gonna walk on by, gonna walk on through
Ain't nothing in the world that you can do
If there ain't no love, then there ain't no use

If there ain't no love, then there ain't no use
Gonna walk on by, gonna walk on through
Ain't nothing in the world that you can do
If there ain't no love, then there ain't no use

Can't even enjoy a fantasy
Without your face jumping in a scene
Can't escape your grip 'cause you clutch my mind
Wanna dream of other girls but you I find
Thought getting you out of my heart was hard
But now I see that was just the start
Your legacy is trying to drive me mad
To forget I concentrate on all the bad
Can't shake this monkey off my back
Tried drinking everything from beer to jack
No answers in all the books I've read

143,If I Had No Loot,Sons Of Soul,Tony! Toni! Toné!,1993-01-01,241466,48,"

[Intro]
If the shoe fits
I want you to wear it and wear it good

[Verse 1]
Talking 'bout them times when I was by myself
I would always be looking for somebody else
But, as time went on, I had a talk with my mind
Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind

[Chorus]
And so, you call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

[Verse 2]
Friends and enemies around me every day
I can't believe half the things they say
Taking me for granted giving no credit at all
I'll just keep bouncing like a bouncing ball
Everybody seems to disappear on me
Can't trust no one as far, as I can see
If I could be that fly that's on the wall
Listening to my friends talk about it all

[Chorus]
You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you
Sons of Soul, y'all

[Guitar Solo]

I don't mean to step on nobody's foot, but ah -

[Verse 3]
When I need somebody there's nobody to call
When they need me, my phone rings off the wall
But these are my friends, and that's what they say
Constantly taking from me every day
You say...

[Chorus]
You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you
Sons of Soul, y'all

[Bridge]

[Chorus x2]
You call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

I'm back again on a higher stage
Listen to the party beat and get in range
Cause you know when I flow and I show you so
Which way is better which way you got to go
To make a fun house party all night
You gotta check this out, yo da ya di
Cause it's party over there with glamour and glairs
(So dance move you , Pump that body!)

Move your body, up and down
Side to side, it's party time
Yeah that's right we're dancing tonight
To the sun is coming up and the sky is all bright
We're coming to the end like you understand
That I'm a partyman do the best I can
To make you laugh again, now I'm out of the scene...

I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me
I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me

Another time, another place
Another rhyme done for every race
In your case, we're getting rough
I'm not going to stop 'till you get enough
Cause you groove back and BoBo is back
And you see it yourself, it's like a heart-attack
My rhymes, combination, infiltration, situation
All over the nation

Like round and round, upside down
Living my life 'till your feet are on the ground
Then put your hands up in the air
And waving like you just don't care
And if you're ready to rap, then rap with me
Somebody say OH YEAH! (oh yeah)
OH YEAH (oh yeah)
AAOW!

I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me
I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me

Now it's just the time, I think you're ready
So make some room and space just to hit it
(Move, move that body)
A didley didley dee
Yeah we make the party to the B to the O to the B to the O
Wanna rock your body wanna rock your soul
When I never ever said I do it better
I just know the time, sounds clever

We're having for the end
Party that was another story
For the party man, and his clan
So they will come again
Show and improve you, it's not the end
It's jam session
My profession
A truly hard yeah one an obsession
But the joke is over, you know what I mean
The party is gone and I'm out of the scene...

I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me
I've got this feeling
Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me

Damn, baby, that sounds sexy

Uh, here I go, here I go, here I go again
Girls, what's my weakness? (Men!)
Ok then, chilling, chilling, minding my business (Word)
Yo Salt, I looked around and I couldn't believe this
I swear, I stared, my niece my witness
The brother had it going on with something kinda uh
Wicked, wicked, had to kick it
I'm not shy so I asked for the digits
A ho, no that don't make me
See what I want slip slide to it swiftly
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks for him
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit
Don't know how you do the voodoo that you do
So well it's a spell, hell, makes me wanna shoop shoop shoop

Um, you're packed and you're stacked 'specially in the back
Brother, wanna thank your mother for a butt like that
(Thanks, Mom)
Can I get some fries with that shake-shake boobie?
If looks could kill you would be an Uzi
Or a shotgun - bang! What's up with that thang?
I wanna know, How does it hang?
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy motha-
Well-a, I like 'em real wild, b-boy style by the mile
Smooth black skin with a smile
Bright as the sun, I wanna have some fun
Come and give me some of that yum-yum
Chocolate chip, honey dip, can I get a scoop?
Baby, take a ride in my coupe, you make me wanna

Baby, ayy-hey, eyy, yeah
Don't you know I wanna shoop, baby?

Well, let me bring you back to the subject, Pep's on the set
Make you get hot, make you work up a sweat
When you skip-to-my-lou, my darling
Not falling in love but I'm falling for your (Super sperm)
When I get ya betcha bottom dollar you were best under pressure
(Yo, Sandy, I wanna like, taste you)
Getcha getcha lips wet cause it's time to have Pep

On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop
To the next man in the three-piece suit

I love you in your big jeans, you give me nice dreams
You make me wanna scream, ooo, oooo, oooo

S and the P wanna get with me, cool (Uh-huh)
But I'm wicked, G, (Yeah) hit skins but never quickly (that's right)
I hit the skins for the hell of it, just for the yell I get
Mmm mmm mmm, for the smell of it

Take the chance, give it all that you can
'Cause he doesn't feel a thing for you
You can try to move on so nothing will go wrong
Maybe he will be back to search for you, oh

Back on the track, it's me, yeah, Fixxit
I proved my point and now we mix it
Yeah, the A, double L Star Fresh, and I got to it together
To make the track flow better

That's why we stand strong, now you know what's up
If i'm on the move I can't stop
The beat is simple but you can't refuse it
That's why I love music

Maybe he will be back to search for you, oh

Again and again I keep going with the swing
I stay funky like this and I bring
Beats to move you so I can prove you
That I can rock a microphone like I used to

I love music, yeah, can you feel it
Check me out, this is how I deal it
The bass, the mid, the treble, I just fuse it
Together, 'cause I love music

Once again a song comin' strong
Here to remind you got to dream on
Go for what you know don't let it slide
Take a change let's ride
To the future, not to the past
Take it easy and not to fast

To blind to see you need to be free
Free from the strain that causes pain
Pain is the name and life is the game

Think about the way
That we live today
Think about the way

So open up your eyes

So find the feeling
So find the feeling
So find the feeling

That we live today
Think about the way

I will survive
Without you
Don't tell me that you wanna leave

If you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go, darling
Maybe it's better that way

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna gonna be fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Walk out that door, see if I care
Go on and go, but...

[Chorus]
Don't turn around
Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
But I won't let you know
I won't let you know

I lose track of time
And I can't see the woods for the trees

Walk my path

You... show me prejudice and greed
You show me how
I must learn to deal with this disease

And I think that you could be my cure

So I am what I am, what I feel cannot be wrong
This is the way that I feel and Im coming on strong
Were talking hundreds and thousands
With potential to stay but only one with quality
Can turn the loneliness away, com folla mi
One is a wonder
One is a wonder
But only one is a wonder
One is a wonder
Set the world on fire
Ill do anything to get what I want
Aim even higher
Ill do anything to be the one
So Im cruising round the continent to see what I can find
A lot of fangs but I refuse to be a slave to the ground
Were talking gadda-da-vida, honey now the deed is done
And if youre in, youve got to show me
That you really are the one, com folla mi
One is a wonder
One is a wonder
But only one is a wonder
One is a wonder

Set the world on fire
Ill do anything to get what I want

Wanna stay in your arms forever
Only love can set you free

And the sun beats down on me
And I know we belong together
Only love can set you free

In the state of ecstasy
Want this night to last forever
Only love can set you free

Love and devotion, baby

Love and devotion, baby love and devotion
You are the sunshine of my life

When a man loves a woman, a woman loves a man
Love and devotion gotta keep it if you can
A kiss, a smile, even when you cry
Everybody knows that we need it once awhile
So come on come on, you gotta keep it if you can
Love and devotion is the master plan
Im talking about Im talking about a wonderful emotion
Im talking about a game called love and devotion
Tonight is the night, when love shines so bright, and we will be reunited

Chorus

O-la o-la o-la o-la hey, o-la o-la I want you baby, I want you baby

One life one love one family. together forever in unity

Tonight is the night when love shines so bright
And we will be reunited

But when I'm gone, you get to gassin' and that's a no no
'Cause I catch you with the flip and goings like this tip
It's going down to what I'm about to get off the tizinip, yeah
Y'all can't deal with the flavor (True, true, true, true)
You know what it is

[Verse 1: Bobby Brown]
When you trust someonе
And you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trustin' about you
And you claim that you
Don't care whеre I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you
Say you trust someone
Why you calling all around?
Think I've got some dip on the side
Girl, you don't trust no one
And you're constantly in doubt
You lose the game if you play that way

No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

[Verse 2: Bobby Brown]
When you love someone
And you wanna love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
When you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you
Say that you love someone
Why you calling all my friends?
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl, you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game if you, if you play that way

My name is Brown, that's what I'm called, so
Don't try to step to be wrong or you'll fall slow

Maybe baby take control of ya
Just like I told ya, I wanna roll
On a tip that's movin'
I'm gonna make ya move and groove and
Leave ya like ""Ooh"" when I touch ya
Give you so much of

When I rub ya up and down
Yo, Stylz, kick it

Well, I know it's been a while since you heard a change in a style
So what I'm gonna do is kick it something fly and new
A change, different from the typical
A bit more than regular, I'm not the others, original
'Cause originality and creativity
Added up together equals the BBB Posse
Yeah, we in the house, yo, kick it

197,This Is How We Do It,This Is How We Do It,Montell Jordan,1995-01-01,277293,58,"

[Intro]
(Background chatter)
This is how we do it!
(This is how we do it!)
Sha la la la la la lo
Shabada lo lo lo, whoa
(This is how we do it!)
Lo lo lo low-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, ""Monty, yo, we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

[Verse 2]
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say...

[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
Y?N-Vee, SCC (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)

[Verse 3]
Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6' 8"" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're makin' tha dash

[Chorus]
Ohh, I'm buzzin' because... (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)

[Outro]
Oh, it's party time! (This is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the West Side (This is how we do it)
OG's got the flavor, yeah (This is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
C'mon now, Def Jam, you know what it is (This is how we do it)

[Spoken Interlude]
Yo Montell, this Percy, man
The barber, your barber
Man I'm sitting up here listening to ya tape, dude
And this shit is on, man
You gon' make it, fool
Keep on doing what you doing, man
My phone number is area code
Nine oh nine, zero, eighty-
Gimme a call, man
We getting ready to step out to the Fox Hills Mall right now
But, uh
It's Monday morning, about a quarter to eleven, peace

200,Crying in the Rain,Inside Out,Culture Beat,1995-01-01,276666,39,"

Stop, you breathe you lie
Loops got ya lost I can't hear ya
Treason took a try
Desperate drown in dirty things
Juvenile Jazz you hide
Can't loose no love from day I shared
Faint twinkle in your eyes
Weary from how you earn your things
You slip from sliding
Slowly, slither, sneaky
Simple for a snake
Poser in pursuit of passion
Can't rush my quiver fake a quake
Betrayer, disarrayer
Leave a soft one frying in the pain
Deceitful, full of that
Couldn't care less if you're crying in the rain

Stop that crying
Stop that lying
It's boring me
I don't wanna spend my time with you
Stop to think
That once you brought me to exctasy
I want the loving that I really need

Wooh, oh, hoh

Stop that crying in the rain now
No more crying in the rain
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a lover's pain
Wooh, oh, hoh

Stop that crying in the rain now
No more crying in the rain
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a lover's pain
Wooh, oh, hoh

Fake, no truth, no real
Trapped in your toss
Can't shake aching
Fictions all you feel
Make up to hide, make up of self
Wicked with step ahead of skills
Menial madness molds your making
Plot to place for prize
Weak known wonders for wealth
You dig the dirt well deep in darkness
Dare to deal on the down low
Tripping for treasures, plastic pleasures
Headline in some kid side show
A taste of a thrill got to have glitter
Serpents seem to savor show
Fool can't afford
To feign alone you're crying in the rain

[Chorus]
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive

[Verse 1]
Money, sex in full control, a generation without soul
Perfect people in a perfect world
Behind closed doors, all in control
Life, in a world of luxury
Cold cash money mentality
You gotta keep the faith, you gotta keep the faith
You'd better keep the faith and run away

[Chorus]
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive

It's time to break free, oh-oh-oh-oh, run away, oh-oh-oh-oh
You better break free, oh-oh-oh-oh, run away, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Money, sex in full control
Big brother is watching you
Unlock your brain and save your soul
No more limits, no more curfew
Life in the perfect system
Take a stand and fight for freedom
Keep the faith, you gotta keep the faith
You'd better keep the faith and run away

[Chorus]
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive
Run away, run away, run away and save your life
Run away, run away, run away if you want to survive

[Recording Info]

[Verse 1: Coolio]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

[Chorus: LV]
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2: Coolio]
Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know

[Refrain: LV]
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

[Chorus: LV]
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin'; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

[Chorus: LV]
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives livin' in the gangsta's paradise

That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Just like a river flowing to the sea
You are running back to me
Come back and save me

Where do you go, My Lovely

Come back and dry the tears, I cried for you baby
You've gotta stop this heartache deep inside
You've gotta help me make it through the night safely
Come back and save me

Where do you go, my lovely
Where do you go
I wanna know, my lovely, I wanna know
Where do you go, my lovely
Where do you go...

Na na na na nida, na na nida da da dee da
Na na na na nida, na na nida da da dee da

[Intro]
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Come on
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, I tried to tell you so (Yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And show you that I'd win

[Pre-Chorus]
You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes, I tried, yes I tried
You lied to me
Even though you knew I'd die for you
You lied to me
Yes, I cried, yes I cried

[Chorus]
Return of the Mack (There it is)
Return of the Mack (Come on)
Return of the Mack (Oh my God)
You know that I'll be back (Here I am)
Return of the Mack (Once again)
Return of the Mack (Top of the world)
Return of the Mack (Watch my flow)
You know that I'll be back (Here I go)

[Verse 2]
So, I'm back up in the game (Hustling slow)
Running things to keep my swing (All night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (Oh, oh, oh)
So baby listen carefully
While I sing my comeback song

[Pre-Chorus]
You lied to me
'Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do, do, do

[Chorus]
Return of the Mack (There it is)
Return of the Mack (Hold on)
Return of the Mack (Don't you know)
You know that I'll be back (Here I go)
Return of the Mack (Oh, little girl)
Return of the Mack (Once my pearl)
Return of the Mack (Up and down)
You know that I'll be back (Round and round)

[Interlude: Angie Brown]
Ahh, Mark, stop lying about your big break
For God sake, I need a real man, uh
(The return of the mack, aoww) stop letting me down
Stop letting me down

[Pre-Chorus]
You lied to me
Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack (Come on)
Return of the Mack (Oh, my God)
You know that I'll be back (Here I am)

You know that I'll be back (Don't you know)

[Verse 1]
I wanted everything for a little while
Why shouldn't I
I wanted to know what it was like
I pushed you too far
And you started laying down the law
'Til I didn't love you any more

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you can pull a little bit
And there's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit
But finally it's gonna break

[Chorus]
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong

[Verse 2]
So there we both were in that little house
Just hanging out
You didn't know what you were about
You turned to me as you were
Threading daisies on a chain
And you said, ""It's decision time again""

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you can pull a little bit
And there's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit
But finally it's gonna break

[Chorus]
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong

And the ground's gonna swallow you
I was wrong
'Cause I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong

I wanted everything for a little while

[Intro]
Yeah
You know what?
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on, playette
Play on, playette
Yo, Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me **** out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (Wow)
I think about the girl all the time (Wow-wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up, girl)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

[Verse 3: Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low-key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers, it curves, so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You've got to pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Oh, yeah)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Bag it up, babe)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Get up)

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, play on)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a **** thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We bes the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-**** broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your **** Chauncy
I'll be sending the call, let's say, around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity (No diggity, no doubt, baby)

[Chorus: Teddy Riley & Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hey, ooh)

Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

[Verse 1]
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred
I'm a veteran, which means that I've been
In the game too long, since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I flow like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Spectacular over M-I-C
I go for broke, never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request
You like the rhyme, bite if you dare
I get the paper so I don't care
Fly that's me; the epitomy
Of what a real MC is supposed to be
Fucking you up every time that I drop
I fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look, it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
It's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun
If you don't understand then say you don't (nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best (say what?)
West to East, see East to West
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive
Cause it's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics
I got many witnesses that can back this
Ruffnecks, from New York to L.A
Been down with me since Poor George
It's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
Make the ill type moves, I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Get out my shit, please let me be
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that
Trying to get over like a fat rat
But I understand I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop
It goes on, on, on, on
You see, the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver
Chilling with
A pina colada, kidada hooked me up
With Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere, that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you?
You better get down with your real crew
'Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

We're aiming for all or nothing now
We're back in the loop and it's time to go on
For us it is all or nothing now

Who are you? Friend or foe?
Now leave your sorrows all behind
This ain't enugh, hanging tough
Now you must make up your mind
We can't stay down, we have to leave
There is no place for us to hide, so this is it
You've been warned now either join or step aside
Cause I'm back

Back! Cause I'm back.....Back!

I'll tell you that it's just too bad

Drive boy, dog boy, dirty numb angel boy
In the doorway boy, she was a lipstick boy
She was a beautiful boy and tears boy
And all in your inner space boy

You had hand girls boy and steel boy
You had chemicals boy, I've grown so close to you
Boy and you just groan boy
She said, ""Come over, come over"", she smiled at you boy

Drive boy, dog boy, dirty numb angel boy
In the doorway boy she was a lipstick boy

She said, ""Come over, come over"", she smiled at you boy

Let your feelings slip boy but never your mask boy
Random blonde, bio high, density rhythm
Blonde boy, blonde country, blonde high density
You are my drug, boy you're real boy

Speak to me and boy dog, dirty numb cracking boy
You get wet boy, big, big time boy, acid bear boy
Babes and babes and babes and babes and babes

Well you like my tin horn boy and get wet like an angel, derail

You got a velvet mouth, you're so succulent and beautiful
You're shimmering and dirty, wonderful and hot times
On your telephone line and God and everything
On your telephone and in walk an angel

And look at me, your mom squatting pissed in a tube
Hole at Tottenham Court Road, I just come out of the ship
Talking to the most blonde I ever met

Shouting, lager, lager, lager, lager

The good guys dress in black remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me: MiB
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't blink be what was there is now gone
Black suit with the black RayBans on
Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back
'Cause you never quite know where the MiBs is at
Uh and

From the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon bright light enters sight, tight
Cameras zoom on the impendin' doom
But then like *BOOM* black suits fill the room up
With the quickness talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralyzer
Vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no MiBs, can I please
Do what we say that's the way we kick it
Yaknahmean? I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're the fearless
MiBs, freezin' up all the flack

I had a dream last night
You were there
You held my hand so tight
I thought I'd just die
Do you remember
When we use to have so much fun
I used to cry sometimes
Those days are gone
Do you remember?

I wanna go back to
Back to the days
When I needed
A little more fun
When I believed I
I believed I
Could fly so high
Through the clouds

Tear down these walls
If just for one day
Tear down these walls
I need you to stay
Stay!

Come on and stay
Stay
Stay

Turning back time to
Times we made love
All day
Under the sun
When I believed I
I believed I
Could fly so high
Through the clouds

Tear down these walls
If just for one day
Tear down these walls
I need you to stay
Stay!

Come on and stay
Stay
Stay

Well there's a bridge and there's a river that I still must cross
As I'm going on my journey
Oh, I might be lost

Well no-one told me just how to get there
But when I get there I'll know
Because I'm taking it

Step By Step, Day By Day, Mile by mile (ooh, ooh, ooh)

So many dangers along the way
So many burdens might fall upon me
So many troubles that I have to face

Oh, but I won't let my spirit fail me
Oh, I won't let my spirit go
Until I get to my destination
I'm going to take it slowly because I'm making it mine

Gotta get jiggy wit it, ooh, that's it

All up in my eye, you got a Prada
Bag with a lot-a, stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay

Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all
Ya don't stop in the winter or the (Summertime)

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin the heat, uh
Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that
Jig it out, uh

[Verse 1]
Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me n' Charlie at the bar runnin up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like (Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin

[Hook]
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

[Verse 2]
Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'mma scoot me somethin hot
In this salsa- merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay papi!""
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An' if you ask how I know, I gots ta plead the fifth

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home

[Verse 1]
In a way, it's all a matter of time
I will not worry for you, you'll be just fine
Take my thoughts with you, and when you look behind
You will surely see a face that you recognize

[Chorus]
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

[Verse 2]
It is the distance that makes life a little hard
Two minds that once were close, now, so many miles apart
I will not falter, though, I'll hold on 'til you're home
Safely back where you belong, and see how our love has grown

[Chorus]
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time

Ah ah
Baby girl was draped in Chanel
Said she love 2Pac but hates some LL
Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings
She can take a prince, turn him into a king
I was looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites
Said her man get paper but he don't live right
All these emotions flowing inside the club
Do you really want a thug or do ya want love?
She gets the paper when it's time to get it
She keep these clowns sinkin' like Chappaquiddick
Honey smoke make you click, feel it in their throats
No joke, all these love letters they wrote
Behind every playa is a true playette
Bounce you up, outta there, push eject
Taster's choice, have you nice and moist
Or play paper games or floss the Rolls Royce

[Chorus]
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
(uh huh) (go ahead daddy)

[Verse 2]
You was king of seduction, cop a suction
Now she with a cat that worked construction
You wanna starve her with the paper, abuse her mind
This a new lover, when you know it's on mine
That's on top, lap dancin' got to stop
You play out your chick cause your game is hot
I give you two, Italian iced my whole crew
Piece banging on my chest 'til I'm black and blue
You beefin', yellin' on the cell of my 6
You reachin', then you hear the cordless click
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'
Hell no, must be out ya mind
Got you on your knees and your elbows each and every time
That's why I love you mami, you
Run your mouth, throw your legs over the bed baby
Work me out

Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon

[Verse 3]
You was all souped up, but played it just right
Mami I was full blown, my game was airtight
I needed to switch up and get it in gear
It's a whole new movie, a world premiere, yeah yeah
Keep it jinglin', no more minglin'
A brand new year, me and you can bring it in
I was sick and tired of the freakin', night to morn'
Bonin' in the mirror with my Cubans on
Let bygones be bygones, no more games
Hope all the chickenheads go up in flames
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back
Got it all figured out, mami I like that
Collect tips, cop his and her whips
To waste a quarter mil on clothes is sick
But you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field
Say what you want, but keep your lips sealed

Something like a phenomenon
Something like a phenomenon

Where did we lose our faith

The word is about - there's something evolving
Whatever may come - the world keeps revolving
They say the next big thing is here
That the revolution's near
But to me it seems quite clear
That it's all just a little bit of history repeating

The newspapers shout - a new style is growing
But it don't know if it's coming or going
There is fashion - there is fad
Some is good - some is bad
And the joke is rather sad
That it's all just a little bit of history repeating

And I've seen it before
And I'll see it again
Yes, I've seen it before
Just little bits of history repeating

Some people don't dance if they don't know who's singing
Why ask your head? It's your hips that are swinging
Life's for us - to enjoy
Woman, man - girl and boy
Feel the pain - feel the joy
And side-step the little bits of history repeating
Just little bits of history repeating

And I've seen it before
And I'll see it again
Yes, I've seen it before
Just little bits of history repeating

So happy

273,Star People,Older,George Michael,1996-05-13,316600,43,"

Maybe your mama gave you up, boy
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl

Star people
Counting your money until your soul turns green
Star people
Counting the cost of your desire to be seen

I do not count myself among you
I may be living in a dream
It's just there seems so many of you
Can't help but hope there's a difference between...
You and me

(You're a star)
I'm talking to you
And you should go far (you're a star)

I said, maybe your mama gave you up, boy
(It's the same old same old)
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl
(Say, how much is enough?)

Star people
Never forget you're secret's safe with me
Just look at all the wonderful people
Trying to forget they had to pay for what you see

It's a dream
With a nightmare stuck in the middle
But listen, brother, where would you be
Without all this attention?
You'd die, I'd die, we'd die
Wouldn't we?
Well wouldn't we?
(You're a star)

I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
(you're a star)


I said, maybe your mama gave you up, boy
(It's the same old same old)
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl
(How much is enough)

You only wanted them to love you
You may have been living in a dream
And as the demons tower above you
You bite your tongue when you really wanna scream

(How much is enough?)
Look at me

I said
Talk about your mother
Talk about your father
Talk about the people who have made you what you are
Talk about your teacher
The bully boy who beat you
Talk about the people who have paid for that new sports car

You're a big, big, big, big star
Look at you

(How much is enough?)
How much is enough?
Did you get off on a bad foot, baby?
Do you have a little tale to tell?
Did you get off on a bad foot?
Bad, bad foot?
Is that why you're a star?
Is that what makes a star?
(How much is enough)
How much is enough?

(Did you get off on a bad foot, baby?
Do you have a little tale to tell?
How much is enough?)

How much is enough?

Babe
Now, nothing comes from nothing, baby
That fame and fortune's heaven sent
And who gives a fuck about your problems, darling
'Cause you can pay the rent?
How much is enough?

[Intro]
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love

[Verse 1]
No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

[Verse 2]
What am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait for you?
Well, I can't do that
And there's no turning back
I need time to move on
I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

[Bridge]
Well, I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore
Oh, I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Sometimes, the feeling is right
You fall in love for the first time
Heartbeat, and kisses so sweet
Summer time love in the moonlight

Now the summer is gone, you have to go back home
Please come and see me again, I never felt more alone
Baby, I'm missing you
I want you by my side
And I hope you miss me too
Come back and stay

I really want you too
You swept my feet right off the ground, you're the love I found

279,It's Like That,The Greatest Hits,Run–D.M.C.,2002-09-10,250626,61,"

[Run]
Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me, because I don't know why
But it's like that, and that's the way it is

[D.M.C.]
People in the world tryin to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said you got to work hard, you want to compete
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

[Run & D.M.C. alternate lines for the remainder of the song]
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

Wars going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity?
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!

You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudiced
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!

You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is
(Repeat these lines til fade)

I don't need your sympathy
There's nothing you can say or do for me
And I don't want a miracle
You'll never change for no one
And I hear your reasons why
Where did you sleep last night?
And was she worth it, was she worth it?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go

[Verse 2]
So you feel misunderstood
Baby have I got news for you
On being used, I could write the book
But you don't wanna hear about it
'Cause I've been losing sleep
And you've been going cheap
She ain't worth half of me, it's true
Now I'm telling you, that

[Chorus]
I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go

Come hell or waters high
You'll never see me cry
This is our last goodbye, it's true
I'm telling you, now

[Chorus]
I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go
Now I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go

Look at the sky
All the stars, man, the stars is beautiful tonight
Look at 'em

[Hook: Mya & (ODB)]
Ghetto supastar (Supastar)
That is what you are (That's what you are)
Coming from afar (Coming from afar)
Reaching for the stars (Reaching from the stars)
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh (Yeah)
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 1: Pras]
Uh, yeah, yo, yo
Some got hopes and dreams, we got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me? I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top divas
Diplomatic legalese; no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'ma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Letting bygones be bygones, and so on, and so on
I'ma teach this cat how to live in the ghetto
Keeping it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
Pa-Pa-Politic with ghetto senators on the D-low

[Hook: Mya & (ODB)]
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar (Uh-huh)
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 2 : ODB]
One, two, and you don't stop, yo!
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Tryna find what's really going on in the streets

[Verse 3: Pras]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree
Kick your balls like Pelé, pick 'em doing ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yelling, ""Ole!""
Who the hell wanna save me?, From B.K. to Cali

[Hook: Mya & (Pras)]
Ghetto supastar (Come on, uh)
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 3: Pras]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
Two-faced, getting defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

[Verse 4: ODB]
Well, I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hanging out
Partying with girls that never die, you see, I was
Picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood

[Chorus: Mya & (Pras)]
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
(Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh)
From one corner to another, uh-huh (yeah)
(All-stars)
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me (Sing it, baby) to another place (Sing it, baby)
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh
(Uh-huh, yeah)
(Heeee, ahhh)

The monarch of the dark in the night alright
We advertise
And specialize
In the exercise and we'll energize
The young ladies' thighs
Cause all the fly guys'
Natures to rise right before their eyes
We're the Earl of the world
And the heir of flair
The Duke of dare, the Mayor of debonaire
Got fine, drink wine
Can dance and dine
Got a first class female oh so fine

[Hook]
Hey baby, whatever you doin right girl
I just want you to always be easy
And keep on shaking that thing
And I want you
Swingin it swingin it swingin
Tell me how now
Like dynamite before it blows
Who needs a band when the beat just goes -- boom!

He's Grandmaster, he cuts faster
We're the Furious, serious, and ever so mysterious
Five that's rockin the house

And everybody say PLAY (PLAY)
Say PLAY (PLAY) well OK!

Ho! Everybody c'mon!
Woo! Now now! Uhh!

People call me crazy, people call me sneak
Just because I'm nasty, they call me a freak, hehe
I am coming over to your house tonight
I promise to you baby that I'll do you right, I'm nasty!

I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha (shake your booty)
I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha (we want to rock you)
Just let us rock you!

[Verse 2]
Watch your girl and watch your wife
I got the kiss of death, to touch your life
Cause I am the man they call Scorpio
I like the fly girls that don't say no

Hey girl, grab my hand, hold on tight
Don't you worry bout a thing, Rahiem'll do you right
I'm a man that's fresh huh, a woman's pet
There ain't a thing in the world that I can't get

In the history books or the picture show
It's the golden voice on your radio
I'm the rapper never printed, voice is solid gold
I'm playin the role, they call me Kid Creole

And I'm the, the Romeo of the nasty show
All the ladies in the place, to my house we go
Freaking in the den just to make you move
Cause I'm Cowboy, and I got the groove

As DJ Flash cuts so mean
That he wanna know your favorite jean
Is it Jordache? (NO!) Gloria Vanderbilt? (NO!)
Maybe it's Sassoon? (NO!) How about Sergio? (I DON'T CARE!)
Could it be Calvin Klein? (NO!) Then what is it?

Back to the bridge y'all

[Hook]

Everybody, shake your body
Keep moving and grooving and screaming and shouting
And helping us turn it out

Is everybody sayin play? (PLAY!)
Say play! (PLAY!) Well OK!

Alright, woo!
Everybody get up!
Oooooeee, yeah!

People say it's dirty, people say it's wrong
They talk about our music like it's a nasty song
It's nasty!

I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha, I wantcha!
Just let us rock, you!

[Verse 3]
Got waterbed seats in my limousine
And everytime I'm seen I got to be clean
I tour around the world to make the people dance
And here's a little message for the ladies in France
Je m'appelle, Melle Mel
Donne moi la petit mademoiselle
Donne moi cinq, donne moi six
Donne moi huit, neuf, dix

I'm seeing this girl that I just adore
I'm seeing this girl that what I never saw before
The way she was swaying and doing the swing
I had to let her know just about my thing
I'm the M, R, N E-Double S
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test
And I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess

Rahiem in your life, what more can you ask
I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Rahiem

Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my sleeve
Only one fine lady, that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game

Well I'mma Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree
On top of the world for the ladies to see
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot
Gonna make everybody wanna rock rock rock
Gonna do it to the East, wanna do it to the West
Gonna make you relax right upon your chest

Grandmaster Flash is willing and able
He's the king of the cuts on two turntables
He's the GRAND, GRAND, the master man
He's so nice with his hands he don't need no band
Rocks 45's and 33's
Rocks boys, men, women, and young ladies
He can slice so precise it's almost fun
And he makes better love than a mint makes money

Slick Rick, Slick Rick, Slick Rick, Slick Rick
Slick Rick, Slick Rick (ha ha hah hah hah), hooooooo-ho!!
Owwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!

Here comes my happiness again
Right back to where it should have been
'Cause now she's gone and I am free
And she can't do a thing to me

I just wanna dance the night away
With senoritas who can sway
Right now tomorrow's lookin' bright
Just like the sunny mornin' light

And if you should see her
Please let her know that I'm well
As you can tell
And if she should tell you
That she wants me back
Tell her no
I gotta go

I just wanna dance the night away
With senoritas who can sway
Right now tomorrow's lookin' bright
Just like the sunny mornin' light

And if you should see her
Please let her know that I'm well

Or watching young life shape
It's in minor keys
Solutions and remedies
Enemies becoming friends
When bitterness ends

Contained in the hum
Between voice and drum
It's in the change
The poetic justice of cause and effect
Respect, love, compassion

Outside
Human nature
Back to--

I think I'm done with the sofa
I think I'm done with the hall
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby

Let's go outside, in the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yes
Let's go outside, in the moonshine
Take me to the places that I love best

So my angel she says ""don't you worry
'Bout the things they're saying, yeah
Got no friends in high places
And the game that you gave away wasn't worth playing""

I know you want to, but you can't say yes
Let's go outside, in the meantime
Take me to the places that I love best

And yes, I've been bad
Doctor won't you do with me what you can
You see I think about it all the time
24/7
You say you want it, you got it
I never really said it before
There's nothing here but flesh and bone
There's nothing more, nothing more, there's nothing more
Back to nature, just human nature
Getting on back to -

I think I'm done with the sofa
I think I'm done with the hall
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby

Doctor won't you do with me what you can

I'd service the community, but I already have you see
I never really said it before
There's nothing here but flesh and bone
There's nothing more, nothing more, there's nothing more

Let's go outside
Dancing on the D-train baby
When the moon is high
And the grass is jumpin'
Come on, just keep on funkin'
Keep on funkin', just keep on funkin'

Kiss me hot like fire
Never cold like ice

And I'll always be true, never will you be blue
You're the best of me, I'll love till I grow old

I can imagine I was stranded on an island with her
And not a soul in the world knew where we were
I visualize and hypnotize, lost in your fur
And I love you more than anything on this earth
Give up the fortune and fame, commence to living alone
Home alone, won't even answer the phone
But every breath I take make the truth unfold
Let the whole world behold you're my heart, you're my soul

You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul

Can y'all feel that
Jig it out, uh

[Verse 1]
Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me n' Charlie at the bar runnin up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like (Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin

Party in the city where the heat is on

Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'mma scoot me somethin hot
In this salsa- merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay papi!""
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An' if you ask how I know, I gots ta plead the fifth

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home
Miami

Party in the city where the heat is on

Or did you like the ride?

You call my name again
No, it's not a sin

And where I've been

We're moving around, dancing the rhythm of life
Time
Mysterious Time
We're counting the hours and days to the end of all time

We are feeling a change
And we don't know why
Choose one direction
Just one for a time
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind
And these are mysterious times

Mysterious times
No trick of the mind
For this moment I feel
Like we live in mysterious times
If you see what's behind
These are mysterious times

Soul
I feel my soul
For this moment nobody can stop me from flying so high
Real
Nothing is real
In a world of illusion you only see what you feel

We are feeling a change
And we don't know why
Choose one direction
Just one for a time
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind

Yeah hey&
Come follow me

I've got all systems go nothing standing in my way
I should be far down the road but I'm not
Something's holding me back like a wild boar attack
And I've got you by my side but your not

Do you remember when
We thought there was no end
A shooting star around the sky
Do you remember when
You were from heaven sent
How far the wind could make me fly

Angels crying, when you're far away from me
Always trying, I will make you see
Angels crying (the angels cry), when you're far away from me
No denying (there's no deny), we were meant to be

I tumbled from the sky
Where I was soaring so high
Never thought that I could fall back down to the ground
Somewhere along the ride
I found that we can't stop the tide
It's time for me to buy another round

Do you remember when
We thought there was no end
A shooting star around the sky
Do you remember when
You were from heaven sent
How far the wind could make me fly

Angels crying, when you're far away from me
Always trying, I will make you see
Angels crying (the angels cry), when you're far away from me

Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

[Verse 1]
There were funky China men from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up, they were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art and everybody knew their part
From a feint into a slip and a kicking from the hip

[Chorus]
Everybody was kung fu fighting, huh
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact, it was a little bit frightening, hey, yeah
But they fought with expert timing

[Verse 2]
There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung
He said, ""Here comes the big boss, let's get it on""
We took a bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip, now we're into a brand new trip

Everybody was kung fu fighting (Huh!)
Those cats were fast as lightning (Ha!)
In fact, it was a little bit frightening (Huh!)

One day when I got hungry
I sold the wooden house
I had to visit Uncle Gundij
Who lives in Calcutta town

Uncle Ghandi, he is rich
He's a taxi driver man
And I know that he will help me
As much as he can

A taxi driver man is what
I want to be
But there are no customers
Who want to ride with me
I dont know why
It could be that I'm almost blind
But every street in Calcutta I can find

Chorus:
Calcutta
I am a taxi driver in
Calcutta
I drive my little taxi in
Calcutta
Taxi, taxi, taxi in
Calcutta
I am a taxi driver man

I like to drive the taxi;
I like it very much
Even though I have no license
I always find the clutch
I can drive without my hands;
I can drive without my feet
And I have no problem
Keeping taxi on the street

Give me time to reason
Give me time to think it through
Passing through the season
Where I cheated you

I will always have a cross to wear
But the bolt reminds me I was there
So give me strength
To face this test of mine

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time
I would stay for the night, for the night

Claim your right to science
Claim your right to see the truth
Though my pangs of conscience
Will drill a hole in you

I've seen it coming like a thief in the night
I've seen it coming from the flash of your light
So give me strength
To face this test of mine

If only I could turn back time
If only I had said what I still hide
If only I could turn back time

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
This Mambo Number 5!

[Verse 1]
One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on, let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice, but I really don't wanna
Beer-bust, like I had last week
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue you know they gettin' sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me flirtin' is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

[Chorus]
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha!)
Mambo Number 5! (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this, then you're doin' it right

[Chorus]
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha!)

[Bridge]
(Ha!) Trumpet!
The trumpet!
Mambo Number 5!
Ha-ha-ha!

[Chorus]
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ooh!)

[Outro]
I do want to
Fall in love with a girl like you
'Cause you can't run and you can't hide
You and me gonna touch the sky
Mambo Number 5! (Ha!)

New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night

Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleeping pill

She never drinks the water, makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her, you'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane (Come on!)

You.....

[Verse 1]
When the world is darker than I can understand
When nothing turns out the way I planned
When the sky turns grey and there's no end in sight
When I can't sleep through the lonely night

Like a flower leaning toward the sun
I turn to you
'Cos you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down

When my insides are wracked with anxiety
You have the touch that will quiet me
You lift my spirit, you melt the ice
When I need inspiration, when I need advice

I turn to you
'Cos you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down

If you'd never helped me through
I hope someday if you've lost your way
You could turn to me, like I turn to you

I turn to you
'Cos you're the only one
Who can turn me around when I'm upside down

From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried

Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about

You've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds

322,Butterfly,The Gift Of Game,Crazy Town,1999-11-04,216733,71,"

[Intro]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

[Verse 1]
Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Verse 2]
I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Verse 3]
Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, me and you's like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

[Breakdown]
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me
Uh huh, uh huh

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Outro]
Come and dance with me (Yeah)
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me (Yeah)
Come and dance with me, uh-ha, uh-ha
Come and dance with me (Yeah)
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me (Yeah)
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me (Yeah)
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me

Yeah
We're gonna do it like this
Aight

Woo

Gimme your love

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
Boy, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey & JAY-Z]
Boy, if I do
The things you want me to
Uh-huh
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Uh-huh
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things
That you know
Persuade me to relinquish my love
To you
But I cannot resist at all

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Boy, if I do
The things you wanna do
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby (Love me, oh)
Or leaving me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Heartbreaker, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me (You got the best)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on, keep on)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
(Why, why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start
(The start that you'd go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm all over ready
Okay, cool, alright
She wanna shop with Jay
Play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She calls me heartbreaker
When we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
Scribble down ""I hate ya"", but she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does, and all

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Oh boy, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me
(Why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start
(Right from the start that you'd)
You'd go and break my heart (Go and break my heart)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me?
(I should have known) I should have known right from the start
(That you would go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
(Boy, if I do) Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
(The things you want me to)
(The way I used to do)
Oh, why did you have to (Would you love me, baby?)
Run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
(Or leave me feeling used) Right from the start
(Would you go and break?) (My heart)
You'd go and break my heart

[Intro]
You know this boogie is for real

[Verse 1]
I used to put my faith in worship
But then my chance to get to Heaven slipped
I used to worry about the future
But then I threw my caution to the wind
I had no reason to be carefree - no, no, no
'Til I took a trip to the other side of town - yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I heard that boogie rhythm
Hey! I had no choice but to get down, down, down, down

[Chorus]
Dance!
Nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby

[Verse 2]
I feel the thunder, see the lightning
I know this anger's Heaven-sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
'Cause of the boogie, I feel so Hell-bent, hey, hey
It's just an instant gut reaction, that I got
I know I've never, ever felt like this before
I don't know what to do
But then that's nothing new
Stuck between Hell and high water, need a cure to make it through, hey!

[Chorus]
Dance, yeah, nothing left for me to do but dance
Of these bad times I'm going through, just dance, hey
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby

Off the nasty things that people say, dance, yeah
But I'm gonna make it anyway
Dance, got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
You know I got canned heat in my heels

You know this boogie is for real

[Verse 3]
Only the wind can know the answer
And she cries to me when I'm asleep
She says you know that you can go much faster
I know that people's talk can be so cheap, hey, hey
I've got this voodoo child in-veined on me
I'm gonna use my power to ascend
You know I've got these running heels to use
Sometimes there's no way I lose
I was born to run and built to last
You never see my feet 'cause they move so fast

[Chorus]
Dance, yeah, nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance, hey
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby
Hey, I've got to dance, yeah
Off the nasty things that people say, dance, yeah
But I'm gonna make it anyway
Dance, got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby

[Bridge]
You know this boogie is for real
Got so much canned heat in my heels, yeah
Gonna dance, gonna dance my blues away tonight
You know I'm gonna dance my blues away
You know this boogie is for real
Got so much canned heat in my heels, yeah
Gonna dance, gonna dance my blues away tonight

Dance, come on! Got canned heat in my heels tonight
Dance! Canned heat in my heels tonight
Dance! (Alright) Canned heat in my heels tonight, baby
Hey, got so much
