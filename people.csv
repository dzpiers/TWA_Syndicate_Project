See I really dig your tone
Did you get the telepathic text message that I sent to your phone?
We're both barely grown
But I know what I like
Say the word and it's on
Can't get you out my head
The deepest shade of red
Sometimes the coolest blue
Or a mix of the two
Your aura match mine
So I had to choose you
My love kaleidoscope
Come and let me change your view

[Hook: Kari Faux + Leven Kali]
I'm feeling your color
Come feel it, babe
Come feel it, babe
I'm feeling your color
Come feel it, babe
Come feel it, babe
And it's next to mine
I'm feeling your color
I feel it, babe
I feel it, babe
I'm feeling your color
I feel it, babe
And it's next to mine

[Verse 2]
You always bring the sunshine
We be up to the sunrise
Prettiest color seen by my eyes
With a stroke of dedication
A little bit of patience
You'll see the bigger picture that we painting
Don't turn down your brightness
I love your saturation
Fill up your cup
Can we get a little faded
To be next to you is a moment I savor
I want this forever
So don't leave me hanging

[Bridge: Leven Kali]
I ain't talkin' bout [?]
I ain't talkin' bout skin
I'm talkin' bout us
I ain't talkin' bout lust
Girl, I'm talkin bout this

[Hook: Kari Faux + Leven Kali]
I'm feeling your color
Come feel it, babe
Come feel it, babe
I'm feeling your color
Come feel it, babe
Come feel it, babe
And it's next to mine
I'm feeling your color
I feel it, babe
I feel it, babe
I'm feeling your color
I feel it, babe
And it's next to mine"

And them bitches is gutted 'cause I took they Jim
Give him a job and he gave me a rim
It was too long, so he gave me a min'
How is that possible? Give me a Kim

And why he in your tummy, bye bye to my ribs
Turn him to a dummy 'cause I got him stiff
And watch, you think it's funny 'til y'all get the dick
And turn into a zombie and swallow your clit

Creeping round corners
I don't feel like myself
Studying your movements
It's a carousel
And I can confirm that you mean what you say
And I'm pretty sure that it's better that way

[Pre-Chorus: Kindora]
Why can't I trust in you?
Am I slipping up over you?
If it really turned to be the way that I think
How bad could it be?
If it really turned to be the way that I think
How bad could it be?

[Chorus: Kindora]
I dont wanna make you think you get away with anything
And I know that we could go for
Round and round like 123
And I gotta question myself
Is it coming?
Possibly
And I gotta wonder
Am I sleeping with the enemy?
I dont wanna make you think you get away with anything
And I know that we could go for
Round and round like 123
And I gotta question myself
Is it coming?
Possibly
And I gotta wonder
Am I sleeping with the enemy?

[Verse 2: bbymutha]
Can't afford to get played again
Bitches wanna be my friend
I don't know what to tell them
I can smell'em
Niggas hard to trust
You dont know me, bitch
I can't be touched
I'm really to fed up
Why you got your eye on me?
I gotta question what the fuck they see
I gotta question every move they make
And breathe they take
Lucifer was beautiful
But that doesn't mean he wasn't a snake
Bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Kindora]
Why can't I trust in you?
Am I slipping up over you?
If it really turned to be the way that I think
How bad could it be?
If it really turned to be the way that I think
How bad could it be?

[Chorus: Kindora]
I dont wanna make you think you get away with anything
And I know that we could go for
Round and round like 123
And I gotta question myself
Is it coming?
Possibly
And I gotta wonder
Am I sleeping with the enemy?
I dont wanna make you think you get away with anything
And I know that we could go for
Round and round like 123
And I gotta question myself
Is it coming?
Possibly
And I gotta wonder
Am I sleeping with the enemy?

[Verse 3: Kindora]
I can't even tell if I'm making this up
Impossible to assume what you want
I'm watching my back like I got nothing left
I give you all I got
Wish I knew what was next

[Pre-Chorus: Kindora]
Why can't I trust in you?
Am I slipping up over you?
If it really turned to be the way that I think
How bad could it be?
If it really turned to be the way that I think
How bad could it be?

[Chorus: Kindora]
I dont wanna make you think you get away with anything
And I know that we could go for
Round and round like 123
And I gotta question myself

And I gotta wonder
Am I sleeping with the enemy?
I dont wanna make you think you get away with anything
And I know that we could go for
