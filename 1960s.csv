1,Brown Eyed Girl,Blowin' Your Mind!,Van Morrison,1967-09,183306,78,"

[Verse 1]
Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughing and a running, hey, hey
Skipping and a jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a thumpin' and you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Verse 2]
Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall, with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Chorus]
Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da

[Verse 3]
So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

[Chorus]
Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da

There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swingin', swayin' and records playin'
Dancin' in the street

Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy grab a girl
Everywhere, around the world

They're dancin'
They're dancin' in the street
Way down in L. A
Every day they're dancin' in the street

Let's form a big strong line and get in time
We're dancin' in the street
Across the ocean blue, me and you
We're dancin' in the street

Everybody's talking at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind

People stopping, staring
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes

Banking off of the northeast winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Wah, wah wah-wah wah
Wah-wah wah-wah, wah wah-wah
Wahhh

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes

Banking off of the northeast winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talking at me
Can't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind

I won't let you leave my love behind
No, I won't let you leave
Wah, wah
I won't let you leave my love behind

All my bags are packed I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn
The taxi's waitin' he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could cry

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh baby, I hate to go

There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll wear your wedding ring

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

One more time let me kiss you
Close your eyes I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times, I won't have to say

So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

People say ""believe half of what you see

Do you plan to let me go

Don't you know

24,California Dreamin' - Single Version,Gold,The Mamas & The Papas,2005,158720,0,"

John and Mitchy were gettin' kinda itchy
Just to leave their folk music behind
Zal and Denny workin' for a penny
Tryin' to get a fish on the line
In a coffee house Sebastian sat
And after every number they'd pass the hat
McGuinn and McGuire just a-gettin' higher in L.A
You know where that's at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
Zal he said, ""Denny, you know there aren't many
Who can sing a song the way that you do, let's go South""
Denny said, ""Zally, golly, don't you think that I wish
I could play guitar like you""
Zal, Denny, and Sebastian sat, at the Night Owl
And after every number they'd pass the hat
McGuinn and McGuire still a-gettin higher in L.A
You know where that's at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
When Cass was a sophomore, planned to go to Swarthmore
But she changed her mind one day
Standin' on the turnpike, thumb out to hitchhike
""Take me to New York right away""
When Denny met Cass, he gave her love bumps
Called John and Zal and that was the Mugwumps
McGuinn and McGuire couldn't get no higher
But that's what they were aimin' at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
Mugwumps, high jumps, low slumps, big bumps
Don't you work as hard as you play
Make up, break up, everything is shake up
Guess it had to be that way
Sebastian and Zal formed the spoonful
Michelle, John, and Denny gettin' very tuneful
McGuinn and McGuire just a-catchin' fire in L.A
You know where that's at
And everybody's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
Broke, busted, disgusted, agents can't be trusted
And Mitchy wants to go to the sea
Cass can't make it, she says, ""We'll have to fake it""
We knew she'd come eventually
Greasin' on American Express cards
Tents low rent, but keepin' out the heat's hard
Duffy's good vibrations and our imaginations
Can't go on indefinitely
And California dreamin' is becomin' a reality

I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told

Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Spoken:]
Then I awake and look around me
At the four grey walls that surround me
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre -
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I touch the green, green grass of home


Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade
Of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green, green grass of home

Over bridge of sighs
To rest my eyes in shades of green
Under dreamin' spires
To Itchycoo Park, that's where I've been

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What did you do there?
I got high
What did you feel there?
Well I cried
But why the tears there?
I'll tell you why

It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful
It's all too beautiful

I feel inclined to blow my mind
Get hung up, feed the ducks with a bun
They all come out to groove about
Be nice and have fun in the sun

Tell you what I'll do (what will you do?)
I'd like to go there now with you
You can miss out school (won't that be cool)
Why go to learn the words of fools?

What will we do there?
We'll get high
What will we touch there?
We'll touch the sky
But why the tears then?
I'll tell you why

Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

[Verse 2]
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

[Chorus]
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

[Verse 3]
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

[Verse 4]
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

[Verse 5]
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

[Verse 6]
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life

From up and down and still somehow

Do you know the way to San Jose?
I’ve been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I’m going back to find
Some peace of mind in San Jose

L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two
They’ll make you a star
Weeks turn into years, how quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

[Verse 2]
You can really breathe in San Jose
They’ve got a lot of space
There’ll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San Jose
I’m going back to find
Some peace of mind in San Jose

Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you’re never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away

[Bridge]
I’ve got lots of friends in San Jose
Do you know the way to San Jose?

Oh, L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car

Are parking cars and pumping gas
I’ve got lots of friends in San Jose
Oh, do you know the way to San Jose?
Hmm, can’t wait to get back to San Jose

In on me

44,To Sir with Love,To Sir With Love,Lulu,1967-05-12,166693,47,"

Those schoolgirl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
""To Sir, with love""

The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To Sir, with love

No matter what you say

You find it happens all the time
Love will never do, what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine?

And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""

And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me

Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossin' you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after that same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me

Baby, here I am, I'm a man on the scene
I can give you what you want but you got to go home with me
I've got some good old loving and I got some in store
When I get through throwing it on you you got to come back for more

Toys and things that come by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but drug store loving
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now, yessir'am

Action speaks louder than word and I'm a man of a great experience
I know you got you another man but I can love you better than him
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I wanna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free, so won't you place your ad with me?

[Chorus 2: Otis Redding]
Boys will come a dime by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but ten cent loving

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening

I'm not superstitious about you
But I can't take no chance
Got me spinning, baby, baby, I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better than any love I know

It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood, baby

No secret, that woman fills my loving cup
'Cause she sees to it that I get enough
Just one touch from her
You know it means so much

It's like thunder, lightning

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

[Chorus 1]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 2]
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 3]
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

[Chorus 3]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 4]
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown

Love is what we need
So if you get that, the blessing will proceed, so please give back

Coming at ya, mob deep on this song
And now it's on
Come together for born
Better yet form Voltron
Spread love like mustard, bust it, making knowledge be born
So trust it, it's B-D-K, learn to love it

[Dionne Warwick](Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love

[Flesh Bone]
I know just exactly what world needs now, plead it
Everybody come show a little love for your family, Jesus we need it   And
Even when I flip through the pages of my history
Slowly reveal the mystery
Got to get it together quickly, in this industry

[Dionne Warwick]
Lord, we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last till the end of time

[Kurupt]
Yo, yo, yo
I could see far and beyond, me and my auntie Dionne
With the homie Fazon, who's cool as freon
As the music plays on, portrays and stays on
Got this thing together, got to get our game together
Life is life and if your ears are open
You could see when you scope doors closed or open
Whether you're in or you're out
You're always in and that's for sure
And that's what friends are for, for what the world needs

[Dionne Warwick] (Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now

[Dionne Warwick]
Lord, we don't need another meadow
There are cornfields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sunbeams and monnbeams enough to shine
Listen Lord, if you want to know

Give me this drug, they call it love
I'd pump it off around the world
To touch the soul of every man, woman, child, boy and girl

[Royal Flush]
I pray that we could live together on this family tree
Royal Flush and Mic G, we want the world to see

[Big Daddy Kane]
What's happening
Is the matter when the people traveling
To grasp a pen and pad and then this united gathering
Keep it on the love, love if you expect the vibe
Work it out just like an exercise, shame of

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
What the world needs no
Come on can we have unity
Just a little bit of unity, brother
Just a little bit, just a little bit of love baby

[Coolio]
L is for the lies that they told and the lines that they crossed
When they burglarized my soul, they cold
O is for the outsiders looking in, times is looking grim
You can't even trust your friends, damn
V, cause it's very necessary
That various policies get variated and eradicated, I hate it
E is for the extra mile you had to walk
Just to talk to your homie who was locing
And to show him you have love for him

[Dionne Warwick]
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now
It's the only thing that there's just too little of

[Flesh Bone]
We humbly gather together united with almighty power
Ready to rumble at any hour
Got love and it won't let me stumble, follow me

[Dionne Warwick]
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now

Can we get together, I'm on my way, baby
Come on get together, unity
We can unify the hip-hop nation

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Bridge 1]

[Verse 2]
She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Bridge 2]

[Additional Verse ]
She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Verse 4]
If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

When she moves my brain screams out this song

Sidewalk crouches at her feet
Like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

71,White Room,Wheels Of Fire,Cream,1968-07-01,298333,70,"

[Intro]

In a white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

[Bridge]

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves

John and Mitchy were gettin' kinda itchy
Just to leave their folk music behind
Zal and Denny workin' for a penny
Tryin' to get a fish on the line
In a coffee house Sebastian sat
And after every number they'd pass the hat
McGuinn and McGuire just a-gettin' higher in L.A
You know where that's at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
Zal he said, ""Denny, you know there aren't many
Who can sing a song the way that you do, let's go South""
Denny said, ""Zally, golly, don't you think that I wish
I could play guitar like you""
Zal, Denny, and Sebastian sat, at the Night Owl
And after every number they'd pass the hat
McGuinn and McGuire still a-gettin higher in L.A
You know where that's at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
When Cass was a sophomore, planned to go to Swarthmore
But she changed her mind one day
Standin' on the turnpike, thumb out to hitchhike
""Take me to New York right away""
When Denny met Cass, he gave her love bumps
Called John and Zal and that was the Mugwumps
McGuinn and McGuire couldn't get no higher
But that's what they were aimin' at
And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
Mugwumps, high jumps, low slumps, big bumps
Don't you work as hard as you play
Make up, break up, everything is shake up
Guess it had to be that way
Sebastian and Zal formed the spoonful
Michelle, John, and Denny gettin' very tuneful
McGuinn and McGuire just a-catchin' fire in L.A
You know where that's at
And everybody's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
Broke, busted, disgusted, agents can't be trusted
And Mitchy wants to go to the sea
Cass can't make it, she says, ""We'll have to fake it""
We knew she'd come eventually
Greasin' on American Express cards
Tents low rent, but keepin' out the heat's hard
Duffy's good vibrations and our imaginations
Can't go on indefinitely
And California dreamin' is becomin' a reality

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

[Chorus 1]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 3]
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

[Chorus 3]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 4]
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night, and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence""

Come gather 'round people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times, they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times, they are a-changin'

The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a-changin'

{Intro}

Well my pad is very messy
And there's whiskers on my chin
And I'm all hung up on music
And I always play to win
I ain't got no time for lovin'
Cause my time is all used up
Just to sit around creatin'
All that groovy kind of stuff

(But) I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so
I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so

Well if I had my choice of matter
I would rather be with cats
All engrossed in mental chatter
Moving where our minds are at
And relating to each other
Just how strong our wills can be
I'm resisting all involvement
With each groovy chick we see

Well I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so
I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so

I got to keep my image
While suspended from a throne
That looks out upon a kingdom
Full of people all unknown
Who imagine I'm not human
And my heart is made of stone
I never had no problems
And my toilet's trimmed with gold

I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so
(Oh, no, no)
I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so

Last night your shadow fell upon my lonely room
I touched your golden hair and tasted your perfume
Your eyes were filled with love, the way they used to be
Your gentle hand reached out to comfort me
Then came the dawn
And you were gone
You were gone, gone, gone

I had too much to dream last night
Too much to dream
I'm not ready to face the light
I had too much to dream
Last night
Last night

The room was empty as I staggered from my bed
I could not bear the image racing through my head
You were so real that I could feel your eagerness
And when you raised your lips for me to kiss

Came the dawn
And you were gone
You were gone, gone, gone

I had too much to dream last night
Too much to dream
I'm not ready to face the light
I had too much to dream

Eight miles high, and when you touch down
You'll find that it's stranger than known
Signs in the street, that say where you're going
Are somewhere just being their own

Nowhere is there warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Rain gray town, known for its sound
In places, small faces unbound

Round the squares, huddled in storms
Some laughing, some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes, and black limousines
Some living, some standing alone

All engrossed in mental chatter
Moving where our minds are at
And relating to each other
Just how strong our wills can be
I'm resisting all involvement
With each groovy chick we see

Well I'm a man

And I can't help
But love you so
I'm a man
Yes I am
And I can't help
But love you so

While suspended from a throne
That looks out upon a kingdom
Full of people all unknown
Who imagine I'm not human
And my heart is made of stone
I never had no problems
And my toilet's trimmed with gold

A time for peace, I swear it's not too late

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I don't know where this dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I don't even know the reason why
But I guess I keep a-gamblin', lots of booze, and lots of ramblin'
Well, it's easier than just a-waitin' around to die

[Verse 2]
Ah one time, friends, I had a ma, I even had a pa
Well he beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me, headed down to Tennessee
Well, it's easier than just a-waitin' around to die

[Verse 3]
I came of age and I found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
Ah she cleaned me out and hit it on the sly
Well, I tried to kill the pain, I bought some wine and hopped a train
It seemed easier than just a-waitin' around to die

[Verse 4]
Then a friend said he knew where some easy money was
We robbed a man and, brother, did we fly
But the posse caught up with me and drug me back to Muskogee
And it's two long years a-waitin' around to die

[Verse 5]
Ah but now I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last
He don't drink or steal or cheat or lie
Ah his name is Codeine, he's the nicest thing I've seen
Well, together we're gonna wait around and die
Yeah, together we're gonna wait around and die

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Bridge 1]

[Verse 2]
She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Bridge 2]

[Additional Verse ]
She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Verse 4]
If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near

Look inside, girl

And so I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me

Miles and miles away from the city's race
Look around for someone lying in the sunshine
Marking time, hear the sighs, close your eyes

Stepping from cloud to cloud, passing years of light
Visit the frosty start in the backwoods flight
Soaring rounds of visions, never mind the meaning
Hidden there, moving fast, it won't last

Ba-da, pa-doo-da

Now, a thousand moons are about to die
No time to reflect on what the time was spent on
Nothing left, far away, dreamers fade

He said to me he wanted to be near to me
He said he never wanted to be out of my sight
But it's too late to give this boy my love tonight
Please wait at the gate of heaven for me, Terry

He said to me he wanted to be close by my side
We had a quarrel. I was untrue on the night he died
And it's too late to tell this boy how great was
Please wait at the gate of heaven for me, Terry

He rode into the night
Accelerated his motorbike
I cried to him in fright
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it

He said to me, you are the one I want to be with
He said to me, you are the one my love I shall give
One day he'll know how hard I prayed for him to live
Please wait at the gate of heaven for me, Terry

He rode into the night
Accelerated his motorbike
I cried to him in fright
Don't do it, don't do it, don.t do it

He said to me, you are the one I want to be with
He said to me, you are the one who my love I shall give
One day he'll know how hard I prayed for him to live
Please wait at the gate of heaven for me, Terry

Vous avez lu l'histoire de Jesse James
Comment il vécut, comment il est mort
Ça vous a plu, hein ? Vous en d'mandez encore
Eh bien, écoutez l'histoire de Bonnie and Clyde

[Couplet 1: Serge Gainsbourg & Brigitte Bardot]
Alors voilà, Clyde a une petite amie
Elle est belle et son prénom c'est Bonnie
À eux deux, ils forment le gang Barrow
Leurs noms, Bonnie Parker et Clyde Barrow

[Refrain: Brigitte Bardot & Serge Gainsbourg]
Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde

[Couplet 2: Brigitte Bardot & Serge Gainsbourg]
« Moi, lorsque j'ai connu Clyde autrefois
C'était un gars loyal, honnête et droit  »
« Il faut croire que c'est la société
Qui m'a définitivement abîmé »

[Refrain: Brigitte Bardot & Serge Gainsbourg]
Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde

[Couplet 3: Serge Gainsbourg & Brigitte Bardot]
Qu'est-ce qu'on a pas écrit sur elle et moi
On prétend que nous tuons de sang-froid
C'est pas drôle, mais on est bien obligé
De faire taire celui qui s'met à gueuler

[Refrain: Brigitte Bardot & Serge Gainsbourg]
Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde

[Couplet 4: Serge Gainsbourg & Brigitte Bardot]
Chaque fois qu'un policeman se fait buter
Qu'un garage ou qu'une banque se fait braquer
Pour la police, ça ne fait pas d'mystère
C'est signé Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker

Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde

[Couplet 5: Serge Gainsbourg & Brigitte Bardot]
Maintenant, chaque fois qu'on essaie d'se ranger
De s'installer tranquilles dans un meublé
Dans les trois jours, voilà le tac, tac, tac
Des mitraillettes qui reviennent à l'attaque

[Refrain: Brigitte Bardot & Serge Gainsbourg]
Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde

[Couplet 6: Serge Gainsbourg & Brigitte Bardot]
Un de ces quatre, nous tomberons ensemble
Moi j'm'en fous, c'est pour Bonnie que je tremble
Quelle importance qu'ils me fassent la peau
Moi Bonnie, je tremble pour Clyde Barrow

[Refrain: Brigitte Bardot & Serge Gainsbourg]
Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde

[Couplet 7: Serge Gainsbourg & Brigitte Bardot]
De toute façon, ils n'pouvaient plus s'en sortir
La seule solution, c'était mourir
Mais plus d'un les a suivis en enfer
Quand sont morts Barrow et Bonnie Parker

179,Trouble Every Day,Freak Out!,The Mothers Of Invention,1966-06-27,350053,44,"

Well I'm about to get upset
From watchin' my TV
Checkin' out the news
Until my eyeballs fail to see
I mean to say that every day
Is just another rotten mess
And when it's gonna change, my friend
Is anybody's guess

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'
Hopin' for the best
Even think I'll go to prayin'
Every time I hear 'em sayin'
That there's no way to delay that trouble comin' every day
No way to delay that trouble comin' every day

Wednesday I watched the riot
I seen the cops out on the street
Watched 'em throwin' rocks and stuff
And chokin' in the heat
Listened to reports
About the whisky passin' 'round
Seen the smoke and fire
And the market burnin' down
Watched while everybody on his street would take a turn
To stomp n' smash n' bash n' crash n' slash n' bust n' burn

And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'
Hopin' for the best
Even think I'll go to prayin'
Every time I hear 'em sayin'
That there's no way to delay that trouble comin' every day
No way to delay that trouble comin' every day

Well, you can cool it, you can heat it
Cause, baby, I don't need it
Take your TV tube and eat it
'N all that phony stuff on sports
'N all the unconfirmed reports
You know I watched that rotten box
Until my head begin to hurt
From checkin' out the way
The newsman say they get the dirt
Before the guys on channel so-and-so
And further they assert
That any show they'll interrupt
To bring you news if it comes up
They say that if the place blows up
They will be the first to tell
Because the boys they got downtown
Are workin' hard and doin' swell
And if anybody gets the news before it hits the street
They say that no one blabs it faster
Their coverage can't be beat
And if another woman driver
Gets machine-gunned from her seat
They'll send some joker with a Brownie
And you'll see it all complete

So I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'
Hopin' for the best
Even think I'll go to prayin'
Every time I hear 'em sayin'
That there's no way to delay
That trouble comin' every day
No way to delay
That trouble comin' every day

Hey, you know something people?
I'm not black but there's a whole lots a times I wish I could say I'm not white

Well, I seen the fires burnin'
And the local people turnin'
On the merchants and the shops
Who used to sell their brooms and mops
And every other household item
Watched a mob just turn and bite 'em
And they say it served 'em right
Because a few of them are white
And it's the same across the nation
Black and white discrimination
Yellin' ""You can't understand me!""
'N all that other jazz they hand me
In the papers and TV
And all that mass stupidity
That seems to grow more every day
Each time you hear some nitwit say
He wants to go and do you in
Cause the color of your skin
Just don't appeal to him
(No matter if it's black or white)
Because he's out for blood tonight

You know we got to sit around at home
And watch this thing begin
But I bet there won't be many
Live to see it really end
Cause a fire in the street
Ain't like a fire in the heart
And in the eyes of all these people
Don't you know that this could start
On any street in any town
In any state if any clown
Decides that now's the time to fight
For some ideal he thinks is right
And if a million more agree
There ain't no Great Society
As it applies to you and me
Our country isn't free
And the law refuses to see
If all that you can ever be
Is just a lousy janitor
Unless your uncle owns a store
You know that five in every four
Just won't amount to nothin' more
Gonna watch the rats go across the floor
And make up songs about being poor

""Blow your harmonica, son!""

183,When a Man Loves a Woman,When a Man Loves a Woman,Percy Sledge,1966,173866,66,"

When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause baby, baby, you're my world

When a man loves a woman...

And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""

And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

As every fairy tale comes real

You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall

To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds

They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall

From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life

Already I'm so lonesome I could cry

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face, at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Bridge 1]

[Verse 2]
She said, there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might have just as well've been closed

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Bridge 2]

[Additional Verse ]
She said, 'I'm home on shore leave,'
Though in truth we were at sea
So I took her by the looking glass
And forced her to agree
Saying, 'You must be the mermaid
Who took Neptune for a ride.'
But she smiled at me so sadly
That my anger straightway died

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

[Verse 4]
If music be the food of love
Then laughter is its queen
And likewise if behind is in front
Then dirt in truth is clean
My mouth by then like cardboard
Seemed to slip straight through my head
So we crash-dived straightway quickly
And attacked the ocean bed

[Chorus]
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

Whoa, my love

Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along

Out through the back yard we'd go walkin'

Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown and

The old home town looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green, grass of home
The old house is still standing
Tho' the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

[Spoken:]
Then I awake and look around me
At the four grey walls that surround me
And I realize, yes, I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre -
Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I touch the green, green grass of home


Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade
Of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green, green grass of home

Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away

Could never wash away my misery

To a bright summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

Spoken:
I wonder if you are lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue

Then came act two
You seemed to changed, you acted strange
And why I've never know

Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you

Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

Since you left me, if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun

And watch her as she grows in my garden

Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly

Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away, away from my love

And where you go I'll follow

[Intro]
Oh, breakin' up is so very hard to do

[Verse 1]
If you really love him
And there's nothing I can do
Don't try to spare my feelings
Just tell me that we're through

[Chorus]
And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breakin' up is so very hard to do

[Verse 2]
And if the way I hold you
Can't compare to his caress
No words of consolation
Will make me miss you less

[Verse 3]
My darling, if this is goodbye
I just know I'm gonna cry
So run to him
Before you start cryin' too

And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself

Though we gotta say goodbye for the summer
Darling I promise you this

243,The Windmills Of Your Mind,Dusty In Memphis,Dusty Springfield,1969-03-31,227840,46,"

Round
Like a circle in a spiral
Like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning
On an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain
Or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning
Running rings around the moon

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
Past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind!

Like a tunnel that you follow
To a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern
Where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving
In a half-forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble
Someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
As the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!

Keys that jingle in your pocket
Words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly?
Was it something that you said?
Lovers walk along a shore
And leave their footprints in the sand

Is the sound of distant drumming
Just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway
And the fragment of this song
Half-remembered names and faces
But to whom do they belong?

When you knew that it was over
You were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning
To the color of her hair!

Like a circle in a spiral
Like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning
On an ever spinning reel

As the images unwind
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind!

To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold

I'm mad about the boy
And I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy
I'm so ashamed of it
But must admit the sleepless nights I've had
About the boy

On the silverscreen
He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
Although I'm quite aware
That here and there are traces of the cad
About the boy

Lord knows I'm not a fool girl
I really shouldn't care
Lord knows I'm not a school girl
Who's in the flurry of her first affair

Will it ever cloy
This odd diversity of misery and joy
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy

I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby

I got your picture hanging on the wall
But it can see or come to me when I call your name
I realized it's just a picture in a frame
Oooh, I read your letters when you're not here
But they don't move me and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear
Don't you know?

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play my game of fantasy
I pretend, but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together.  (Oh, oooh.)
I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of your being there
Oh

So glad we got the real thing, baby
So glad we got the real thing
Oh, Marvin.  (I know, honey.)
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.  (So glad, so glad.)

While you lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever til the end of time

[Intro]
I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine
But mama said

[Chorus]
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

[Verse 1]
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

[Chorus]
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

[Verse 2]
No I can't bear
To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own
But when I feel that I
I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hangin' on
I remember mama said

[Chorus]
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
(Now wait)

[Bridge]
No, love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
I keep on waiting (Ooh, until that day)
But it ain't easy
It ain't easy
But mama said

[Chorus]
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

Oh, someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry
Oh I wanna die

It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual it happens every day
No matter what you say

You find it happens all the time
Love will never do, what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine?

It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual, to be sad with anyone
But if I ever find that you've changed at anytime
It's not unusual to find out I'm in love with you

Last row in the balcony?

Well, there's Technicolor and Cinemascope
A cast out of Hollywood
And the popcorn from the candy stand
Makes it all seem twice as good
There's always lots of pretty girls
With figures they don't try to hide
But they never can compare
To the girl sitting by my side

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide

[Verse 1]
It's not love
I'm running from
It's the heartaches
That I know will come
'Cause I know
You're no good for me
But you`ve become
A part of me
Everywhere I go
Your face I see
Every step I take
You take with me, yeah
Nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
I know you're
No good for me
But free of you
I'll never be, no
Each night as I sleep
Into my heart you creep
I wake up feeling sorry I met you
Hoping soon that I'll forget you
When I look in the mirror
And comb my hair
I see your face
Just a-smiling there

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide

[Verse 2]
I know you're
No good for me
But you've become
A part of me
How can I fight a lover
That's sugar sweet
When it's so deep, so deep
Deep inside of me
My love reaches so high
I can't get over it
It's so wide
I can't get around it, no
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
From you, baby
Just can't get away
No matter how I try
I know you're no good for me
But free of you I'll never be

[Chorus]
Nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to run
Got nowhere to run

[Verse 1]
It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Verse 2]
They furnished off an apartment with
A two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Verse 3]
They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records
All rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Verse 4]
They bought a souped-up jitney, was a cherry red '53
And drove it down to Orleans to celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre was wedded to the lovely madamoiselle
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Baby baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet

Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over)
After I've been good to you

After I've been sweet to you

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her, maybe one or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?

And rush off to her charms
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over)
Haven't I been sweet to you?

I'm so afraid of losing you forever

Darling, I can't go on with you.  (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
This emptiness won't let me live without you
(And I need you and I love you, baby.)
This loneliness inside me, darling, (And I need you and I want you, baby.)
Makes me feel half alive.  (And I need you and I...)

Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving

[Verse 1: Otis Redding]
Baby, here I am, I'm a man on the scene
I can give you what you want but you got to go home with me
I've got some good old loving and I got some in store
When I get through throwing it on you you got to come back for more

[Chorus 1: Otis Redding]
Toys and things that come by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but drug store loving
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now, yessir'am

[Verse 2: Otis Redding]
Action speaks louder than word and I'm a man of a great experience
I know you got you another man but I can love you better than him
Take my hand, don't be afraid, I wanna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free, so won't you place your ad with me?

[Chorus 2: Otis Redding]
Boys will come a dime by the dozen
But that ain't nothing but ten cent loving
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now, yessir'am

Hey there, Georgy girl
Swingin' down the street so fancy-free
Nobody you meet could ever see
The loneliness there
Inside you

Hey there, Georgy girl
Why do all the boys just pass you by?
Could it be you just don't try
Or is it the clothes you wear?

You're always window-shopping
But never stopping to buy
So, shed those dowdy feathers and fly
A little bit

Hey there, Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And, oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see
A new Georgy girl

Hey there, Georgy girl
Dreamin' of the someone you could be
Life is a reality
You can't always run away

Don't be so scared of changing
And rearranging yourself
It's time for jumping down from the shelf
A little bit

Hey there, Georgy girl
There's another Georgy deep inside
Bring out all the love you hide
And, oh, what a change there'd be
The world would see
A new Georgy girl

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there tryin’ to fool the public
But when it comes down to foolin’ you
Now, honey, that's quite a different subject
But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Really I'm sad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)
Oh, sadder than sad
(I'm hurt so bad)
You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad
(I pretend to be glad)
Like a clown, I pretend to be glad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)

[Chorus]
Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Mmm-hmm, oh yeah, baby

[Verse 2]
Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I’ve tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Decided to go
(Why did you go?)
Oh, I need you so
(I need you so)
I'm hurt and I want you to know
(Want you to know)
But for others I put on a show
(It's just a show) Ooh-oh

There's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Just like Pagliacci did (The great pretender)
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye (The great pretender)
But in my lonely room, I cry

[Chorus]
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby

Now if there's a smile on my face (Tears of clown)
Don't let my glad expression (Tears of a clown)
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear (Tears of a clown)
Make you think that I don't care
When really I'm sad
Hurtin’ so bad (Tears of a clown)
Cryin’ all the time...

And she would show me what she'd bought

Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same

Beginning in a queue

No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to a vow

That little girl was mine
If I'd been true

The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood, baby

But I can't take no chance
Got me spinning, baby, baby, I'm in a trance

Funny but it's true
What lonliness can do
Since I've been away
I have loved you more each day

Walking back to happiness
Said goodbye to loneliness
I never knew I'd miss you
Now I know what I must do
Walking back to happiness I shared with you

I'm making up everything you said
And mistakes to which they lead
I shouldn't have gone away
So I'm coming back today

Walking back to happiness I threw away
Walking back to happiness with you
Said farewell to loneliness I knew

Played aside foolish pride
Learnt the truth from tears I cried
Spread the news I'm on my way
All my blues have blown away

I'm bringing you love so true
Cause that's what I owe to you

Walking back to happiness I shared with you
Walking back to happiness with you
Said farewell to loneliness I knew

Played aside foolish pride
Learnt the truth from tears I cried
Spread the news I'm on my way

Cause that's what I owe to you

Walking back to happiness I shared with you
Walking back to happiness again
Walking back to happiness again

[Verse 1]
I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 2]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 3]
People say ""believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear""
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me dear:
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
I heard it through the grapevine
I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

Honey, Honey, I know (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm the lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say:
Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby, let me love you

Only one thing wrong with a pretty good song
'Cause a pretty good song goes a long
And a long and a long and a long and a long
And a long and a long and a long and a long
'Til it gets me red in the face

'Cause it ain't got no swallerin' place

I can finish a sack of cracker jacks in 15 seconds flat
And still keep the conversation running fair
I can kiss my darling sweetheart and hold it half an hour
And I ain't half dead when I come up for air

But darn, this song it's a pretty good song
Only one thing wrong with a pretty good song
'Cause a pretty good song goes a long and a long
And a long and a long and a long and a long

But I just ain't built like a rubber balloon
It's a pretty good tune and a croon
And a croon and a croon and a croon
And a croon and a croon and a croon
And croon and croon
And I can't keep up with the pace

It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people, that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud

Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm going to join the family circle at the throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by

Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But, I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Daddy sang bass
Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there

I wanna tell you all the story 'bout
A Harper Valley widowed  wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
And she said mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA

Well the note said Mrs. Johnson
You're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking
And a-running round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up
Your little girl this way
And it was signed by the Secretary
Harper Valley PTA

Well, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet
That very afternoon
And they were sure surprised
When Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA

Well there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why
Your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down

Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did
It happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA

Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Love's gonna live here again
Love's gonna live here again

377,Ode To Billie Joe,Ode To Billie Joe,Bobbie Gentry,1967-08-21,255001,56,"

It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door, ""Y'all, remember to wipe your feet!""
And then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

And Papa said to Mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

Mama said to me, ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all mornin', and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billie Joe was throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round; Papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge

I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend?

You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget (to forget)
Pretend we've never met (never met)
And I've tried and I've tried, but I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces

I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name (speaks your name)
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame

You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who'll love me too (love me too)
The way you used to do (used to do)
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces
You walk by and I fall to pieces

379,The Cold Hard Facts of Life,The Cold Hard Facts of Life,Porter Wagoner,1967-07-24,192946,41,"

[Verse 1]
I got back in town a day before I'd planned to
I smiled and said ""I'll sure surprise my wife""
I don't think I'll phone, I'll just head on home
For I didn't know the cold hard facts of life

[Verse 2]
I passed a little wine store on the corner
I pictured pink champagne by candlelight
I stopped the car right then, got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life

[Verse 3]
A stranger stood there laughing by the counter
He said ""I'll take two bottles of your best""
Her husband's out of town and there's a party
He winked, as if to say ""You know the rest""

[Verse 4]
I left the store two steps behind the stranger
From there to my house, his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't 'til he turned into my drive that I learned
I was witnessing the cold hard facts of life

[Verse 5]
I drove around the block 'til I was dizzy
Each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in

[Verse 6]
Lord, you should've seen their frantic faces
They screamed and cried ""Please put away that knife""
I guess I'll go to hell or I'll rot here in this cell
But who taught who the cold hard facts of life?
Who taught who the cold hard facts of life?

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

Well, here I sit high, gettin' ideas
Ain't nothin' but a fool would live like this
Out all night and runnin' wild
Woman's sittin' home with a month old child

Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman would you weep for me?

Just sittin' 'round drinkin' with the rest of the guys
Six rounds bought and I bought five
I spent the groceries and a half the rent
I lack fourteen dollars havin' twenty seven cents

Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman would you weep for me?

They say roses are red and violets are purple
And sugar's sweet and so is maple syrple
Well I'm seventh out of seven sons
My pappy was a pistol, I'm a son of a gun

I said dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman would you weep for me?

A country boy set out to see the world
Remember when those city lights shine down
That big old moon shines on your Kentucky Girl

How bright is it shining in your world?

Teardrops fell on mama's note when I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home

[Chorus]
Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home

I know this is the same road I took the day I left home but it sure looks different now
Well I guess I look different too 'cause time changes everything
I wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way
Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home

[Verse 3]
Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

[Chorus]
Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home
Lord I'm still five hundred miles away from home

384,Almost Persuaded,Almost Persuaded,David Houston,1966,176360,44,"

Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man

Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside

Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you""
""Take me away from here and be my man""
Then I've looked into her eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band

And I was almost persuaded
To let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded
But your sweet love made me stop and go home

385,The Race Is On,Best Of,George Jones,2013-01-01,126533,0,"

I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside
Like my heart's sprung a big leak
And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
That I may never shake
Now you might say that I was taking it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

One day I had ventured in love, never once suspecting
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning
And finding that you'd gone from me
There's aching and pain in my heart
For the day was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, In your hand

[Chorus]
Are you going away
With no word of farewell?
Will there be not a trace left behind?
I could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

As we walk along my thoughts are tumblin'
Round and round, round and round
Underneath our feet a subway's rumblin'

Doo da doo doo doo doo da doo doo doo

Who is the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Rolling down the highway in my Jimmy hauling freight
From Chicago to St Louis Lord I see her every day
A double clutching weasel like me can hardly ever get a girl to look at him that way
Like the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Well what a girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
I bet it wouldn't take her very long to be gone
If someone would pull a dirty trick and take her hot pants away
I slow my Jimmy down to twenty that's how many wrecks I see there every day
Caused by the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

A doo da doo doo doo doo da doo doo doo

Doggone that girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Sleepy headed painter said the girl wasn't real better get the (kwee) on my way
On Route 66 from the billboard to Chicago
You'll find tiny pieces of my heart scattered every which a way
Shattered by the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

389,Yesterday When I Was Young,The Best Of Roy Clark,Roy Clark,2005-08-09,200240,0,"

Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away

Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for
Yesterday when I was young...

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove

When troubles surround us, when evils come
The body grows weak, the spirit grows numb
When these things beset us,he doesn't forget us
He sends down his love
On the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove

When Noah had drifted on the flood many days
He searched for land in various ways
Troubles, he had some,but he wasn't forgotten
He sent him his love
On the wings of a dove

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove

When Jesus went down to, the river that day
He was baptised in the usual way
And when it was done, God blessed his son
He sent him his love

Cheat on your taxes, don't be a fool
Now what was that they said about a golden rule?
Never mind the rule, just play to win
And hate your neighbor for the shade of his skin

Skip a rope, skip a rope

Carroll County's pointed out asá kind of square
The biggest thing that happensá is the county fair
I guess that's why it seemed likeá such a big event
What we call the Carrollá County accident

The wreck was on the highway just inside the line
Walter Browning lost his life and for a time
It seemed that Mary Ellen Jones would surely die
But she lived long enough for her to testify

Walter Browning was a happyá married man
And he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand
But it was gone, nobody kneW just where it went
He lost it in the Carroll County accident

Mary Ellen testified that he flagged her down
Said he was sick and could she drive him into town
No one ever doubted what she said was true
'Cause she was well respected in the county too

I went down to see the wreck like all the rest
The bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess
But I found something no one else had ever seen
Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine

A little match box circled by a rubber band
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand
It took awhile to figure out just what it meant
The truth about the Carroll County accident

By dark of night I dropped the ring into a well
And took a sacred oath that I would never tell
The truth about the Carroll County accident
Cause the County ordered dad a marble monument

Yes, I lost him in the Carroll County accident

Ev'ry mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six foot six and weighed two forty five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew, ya didn't give no lip to Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 2]
Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, he kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, he just said, ""Hi"" to Big John

[Verse 3]
Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the Promised Land, Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 4]
Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

[Verse 5]
Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant Oak tree, he just stood there alone, Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 6]
And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, ""There's a light up above""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, Big John

[Verse 7]
With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John

[Chorus]
(Big John, Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

[Verse 8]
Now they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John

Today I sat alone at the window
And I watched our little girl outside at play
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today

So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim
'Cause I heard him name a game and I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him

I don't wanna play house
I know it can't be fun
I've watched mommy and daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house
It makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house
My daddy said good-bye

I don't wanna play house
I know it can't be fun

And if that's the way it's done

Bll-bbb, I done a double back flip

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you want to holler hi-de-ho
Burns your tummy, don'tcha know?
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Chug, Chug, chug-a-lug

399,It's Such A Pretty World Today,Lost Country Hits of the 60s,Various Artists,2013-01-01,150093,41,"

Where am I, how did I get here?
Today is very different than yesterday
So this is the world?  I miss my old womb
The wallpaper here just ain't the same

This world is something strange
I'm wet, I'm cold, I need a change
This world is something new to me

Oh, my head! What is this? I can't take it!
Me either!

I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm irritated
But I love the extra leg room
Man! They cut my cord!
Consider yourself lucky!

This world is way too big
And populated by fuzzy pigs
This world is something new to me

This world is such a gas
P.U., where's your class?
This world is something new to me

Quiet! can't a guy get some shuteye?
It's so noisy in here
I can barely hear myself suck

The food here tastes pretty good
My compliments to the chef
And you gotta holler to get fed
But I could get used to that

This world is way too bright
Can't somebody turn down the light?
So that's what that thing looks like

All things here are meant for play
It's gonna be a real cool day
This world is something new to me

This world is something new to me

400,Wine Me Up,Hello Walls,Faron Young,2013-10-23,144120,41,"

I'm the center of attention in this barroom
Cause I've got a biggest heartache of the year
And each night those swinging doors reach out for me and draw me in
'Cause they know each night that I'll come back to wine me up again

Wine me up, turn me on and watch me cry for you
Lately drinking warm red wine is all I want to do
And I never know how tight I'll wine me up till I walk in
But I don't care cause I'll be back to wine me up again

I'd like to thank the men that raise the grapes way out in California
And I'm hoping this will be their biggest year
'Cause scarlet water's all that's left to keep me hanging on
And that's why I'll try to wine me up each day and night next year

Wine me up turn me on and watch me cry for you
Lately drinking warm red wine is all I want to do
And I never know how tight I'll wine me up till I walk in
But I don't care cause I'll be back to wine me up again...

So I feel so blue sometimes I wanna die
And so I've got a broken heart so what
They say that time will heal all wounds in mice and men
And I know that someday I'll forget and love again

[Chorus]
But just between you and me I've got my doubts about it
'Cause just between you and me you're too much to forget

[Verse 2]
So I lost the only girl I ever loved
And so I've never felt so low so what
I'll just tell myself each time I wanna cry
That someday time will dry the teardrops from my eyes

But just between you and me, I'm not so sure about it
'Cause just between you and me, you're too much to forget
You're too much to forget

Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Won't you come on in
Miracles I guess
Still happen now and then
Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Welcome to my world
Built with you in mind
Knock and the door will open
Seek and you will find
Ask and you will be given
The key to this world of mine
I'll be waiting here
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world

403,Ballad Of Forty Dollars,20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection: Best Of Tom T. Hall,Tom T. Hall,2000-01-01,183400,0,"

The man who preached the funeral
Said it really was a simple way to die
He laid down to rest one afternoon
And never opened up his eyes

They hired me and Fred and Joe
To dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours
And I guess we must've drunk a case of beer

I guess I ought to go and watch them put him down
But I don't own a suit
And anyway when they start talkin' about
The fire in Hell, well, I get spooked

So, I'll just sit here in my truck
And act like I don't know him when they pass
Anyway, when they're all through
I've got to go to work and mow the grass

Well, here they come and who's that
Ridin' in that big ol' shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome, I do believe
That that's the sharpest thing I've seen

That must belong to his great uncle
Someone said he owned a big ol' farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down
And look it over, that won't do no harm

Well, that must be the widow in the car
And would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress
You know, some women do look good in black

Well, he's not even in the ground
And they say that his truck is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard
But you can't tell too much behind the veil

Well, listen, ain't that pretty
When the bugler plays the Military Taps
I think that when you's in the war
They always hide 'n play a song like that

Well, here I am and there they go
And I guess you'd just call it my bad luck
I hope he rests in peace, the trouble is
The fellow owes me forty bucks

You've been making your brags around town
That you've been a-loving my man
But the man I love, when he picks up trash
He puts it in a garbage can

And what I see is a pity
You'd better close your face and stay out of my way

'Cause I'll grab you by the hair of your head

If you don't wanna go to Fist City

Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is
Since you think you're hot stuff

You better move your feet, if you don't wanna eat
A meal that's called Fist City

I keep hearing you're concerned about my happiness
But all the thought you're giving me is conscience, I guess
If I were walking in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worrying 'bout me
I'm having lots of fun

So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doing fine
You can always find me here and having quite a time

Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

Don't tell me I've nothing to do

406,"Saginaw, Michigan","Saginaw, Michigan",Lefty Frizzell,1964-07-01,182573,41,"

[Verse:]
I was born in Saginaw, Michigan
I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My dad was a poor, hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl in Saginaw, Michigan
The daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me 'that son of a Saginaw fisherman'
And not good enough to claim his daughter's hand
Now I'm up here in Alaska, looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool, I'm digging in this frozen ground so cold
But with each new day, I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I wrote my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I said ""Honey, I'm coming home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad, I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondike history""
Her dad met me in Saginaw, Michigan
He gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said ""Son, you're wise young ambitious man
Will you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim?""
Now he's up there in Alaska, diggin' in the cold, cold ground
The greedy fool is looking for the gold I never found
It serves him right, and no one here is missing him
Least of all the newlyweds of Saginaw, Michigan
We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw, Michigan
He's ashamed to show his face in Saginaw, Michigan

My names in the paper where I took the Boy Scouts to hike
My hands are all dirty from working on my little boy’s bike
The preacher came by and I talked for a minute with him
My wife’s in the kitchen and Margie is at the Lincoln Park Inn

And I know why she’s there I’ve been there before
But I made a promise that I wouldn’t cheat anymore
I try to ignore it but I know she’s in there my friend
My mind’s on a number and Margie is at the Lincoln Park Inn

Next Sunday it’s my turn to speak to the young peoples' class
And they expect answers to all the questions they ask
What would they say if I spoke on a modern day sin?
And all of the Margie’s and all of the Lincoln Park Inns

The bike is all fixed and my little boy’s in bed asleep
His little warm puppy is curled in a ball at my feet
My wife’s baking cookies to feed to the bridge club again
I’m almost out of cigarettes and Margie is at the Lincoln Park Inn
And I know why she’s there

408,Take Me,The Essential George Jones,George Jones,2006,140733,44,"

Take me, take me to your darkest room
Close every window and bolt every door
The very first moment I heard your voice
I'd be in darkness no more
Take me to your most barren desert
A thousand miles from the nearest sea
The very moment I saw your smile
It would be like heaven to me
There's not any mountain to rocky to climb
No desert too barren to cross
Darlin', if you would just show a sign of love
I could bear any loss
Take me to Siberia
And the coldest weather of the winter time
And it would be just like spring in California
As long as I knew you were mine
There's not any mountain to rugged to climb
No desert too barren to cross
Darlin', if you would just show a sign of love
I could bear any loss...

For you haven't let me wear one in such a long long while
Still I keep running back why must this be

But why take revenge on one who loves you so

For you haven't let me wear one in such a long long while

I love those bright lights and country music
I won't stay home and cry tonight like all the nights before
I've just learned that I don't really need you anymore
I found a little place downtown where guys like me can go
And they've got bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music a bottle and a glass
Soon I'll be forgetting that there ever was a past
And when everybody asks me what helped me forget so fast
I'll say bright lights and country music

A table by the bandstand a bottle filled with wine
Honky tonks were made for men with women on their minds
Nothing else can take away this loneliness of mine
Quite like bright lights and country music
Bright lights and country music...
I love those bright lights and country music

Her face reflects as much of me as any mirror can
And my image in her eyes is all I know of who I am
But even as I see myself the lines begin to blur
For who I am has long been tied and tangled up in her

And it isn't luck or chance she can read me at a glance
Not just because she's clever and she's smart
No, it's just by now she knows my heart
By heart

It seems like it's been centuries since she and I began
And both of us took all our chances on a single hand
Though we took it day to day it's gone from year to year
And no one ever close to me was ever half as near

And it isn't any trick or because her mind is quick
She reaches my conclusions as I start
No, it's just by now she knows my heart
By heart

And amazing as it seems she brings magic to my dreams
Not just because she's mastered magic's art
No, it's just by now she knows my heart
By heart

She knows my heart...

421,Phantom 309,20 All Time Greatest Hits,Red Sovine,2005,203733,44,"

I was out on the West Coast, tryin' to make a buck
And things didn't work out, I was down on my luck
Got tired a-roamin' and bummin' around
So I started thumbin' back East, toward my home town

Made a lot of miles, the first two days
And I figured I'd be home in week, if my luck held out this way
But, the third night I got stranded, way out of town
At a cold, lonely crossroads, rain was pourin' down

I was hungry and freezin', done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
And I climbed in that cab, where I knew it'd be warm

At the wheel sit a big man, he weighed about two-ten
He stuck out his hand and said with a grin
""Big Joe's the name"", I told him mine
And he said: ""The name of my rig is Phantom 309.""

I asked him why he called his rig such a name
He said: ""Son, this old Mack can put 'em all to shame
There ain't a driver, or a rig, a-runnin' any line
Ain't seen nothin' but taillights from Phantom 309.""

Well, we rode and talked the better part of the night
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said: ""I'm sorry son, this is as far as you go
'Cause, I gotta make a turn, just on up the road.""

Well, he tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low
And said: ""Have yourself a cup on old Big Joe.""
When Joe and his rig roared out in the night
In nothin' flat, he was clean out of sight

Well, I went inside and ordered me a cup
Told the waiter Big Joe was settin' me up
Aw!, you coulda heard a pin drop, it got deathly quiet
And the waiter's face turned kinda white

Well, did I say something wrong? I said with a halfway grin
He said: ""Naw, this happens every now and then
Ever' driver in here knows Big Joe
But son, let me tell you what happened about ten years ago

At the crossroads tonight, where you flagged him down
There was a bus load of kids, comin' from town
And they were right in the middle, when Big Joe topped the hill
It could have been slaughter, but he turned his wheel

Well, Joe lost control, went into a skid
And gave his life to save that bunch-a kids
And there at that crossroads, was the end of the line
For Big Joe and phantom 309

But, every now and then, some hiker'll come by
And like you, Big Joe'll give 'em a ride
Here, have another cup and forget about the dime
Keep it as a souvenir, from Big Joe and Phantom 309!""

To honor the million tears he's cried
And the hurt in his eyes would show, so everyone would know
Concealed is a broken heart inside

So, build a statue and oh build it high so that all can see
Then inscribe: The World's Greatest Fool, and name it after me

You've been makin' your braggs around town
That you've been a lovin' my man
But the man I love
When he picks up trash
He puts it in a garbage can
And that's what you look like to me
And what I see's a pitty
You better close you face and stay outta my way
If you don't wanna go to fist city

If you don't wanna go to fist city
You better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab a you by the hair a the head
And I'll lift off of the ground
I'm not a sayin' my baby's at saint
'Cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you gal to lay off a my man
If you don't want to go to fist city

Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is
Since you think you're hot stuff
You'll bite off more than you can chew
If you get to cute or witty
You better move your feet
If you don't wanna eat
A meal that's called fist city

If you don't wanna go to fist city
You better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab a you by the hair a the head
And I'll lift off of the ground
I'm not a sayin' my baby's at saint

So break out the bottle bring on the crowd
Just gather round me cause misery loves a company
I've just left my home friends where I couldn't sleep
For missin' a woman that I couldn't keep
She just walked out and left me for somebody else
Now her memory keeps hauntin' me when I'm by myself
So break out the bottle bring on the crowd
Tell funny stories turn the jukebox up loud
Come on sit at my table where the drinks are on me
Just gather round me cause misery loves company

Now I'm not the first one who's lost everything
To a false hearted woman with a false hearted dream
But this is the first time I've suffered myself
Help me get over this love I'll handle the next love all by myself
So break out the bottle...

431,Green Green Grass of Home,20 All Time Greatest Hits,Porter Wagoner,2005,178266,42,"

The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
And down the road I look and there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me arms areached smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me at these four grey walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's that sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home
They'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of home

432,Big Iron,Gunfighter Ballads And Trail Songs,Marty Robbins,1959,235733,67,"

[Verse 1]
To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 2]
It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
""He's an outlaw loose and running""
Came the whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip""
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 3]
In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

[Verse 4]
Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona Ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

[Verse 5]
Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 6]
The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome Ranger
Was about to meet his death
'Bout to meet his death

[Verse 7]
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the Ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 8]
It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin'
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Outro]
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

Pop a top again
I've just got time for one more round
Set 'em up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

I'd like for you to listen to
A joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through
And calmly walked away

I tried to smile and did awhile
But it felt so out of place
Did you ever hear of a clown with teardrops
Streaming down his face

Pop a top again
I think, I'll have another round
Another one my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

All to me is misery
And here I'm wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools
Is not what's on my mind

But then you see her leaving me
Is not what I prefer
So it's either here, a drinking beer
Or home remembering her

Pop a top again
I think, I'll have another round
Another one my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

I'm tempted, my darling, to steal you away
Don't let me cross over, stay out of my way
You know that I love you and I'm not the stealing kind
But I'm faced with heartache and loves cheating line

Don't let me cross over loves cheating line
You belong to another and you'll never be mine
I know one step closer would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over loves cheating line

I tried to forget you but what else can I do
When your eyes keep on saying that you love me too
I know if I lose you, not a dream will I have left
I don't want to cheat, dear, but I can't help myself

Don't let me cross over loves cheating line
You belong to another and you'll never be mine
I know one step closer would be heaven divine

435,The Streets of Baltimore,Streets of Baltimore,Bobby Bare,1966-08-22,157640,42,"

I sold the farm to take my woman where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee
I bought those oneway tickets she had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Her heart was filled with laughter when she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth is Baltimore at night
Oh well a man feels proud to give his woman what she's longing for
And I kind of liked the streets of Baltimore
Well I got myself a factory job I ran an old machine
I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
Yet every night when I came home with every muscle sore
She would drag me through the streets of Baltimore
Well I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be
But I soon learned she loved those bright lights much more than she loved me
Now I'm a going back on that same train that brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
Yes my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

Från Öckerö loge hörs dragspel och bas
Och fullmånen lyser som var den av glas
Där dansar Fredrik Åkare kind emot kind
Med lilla fröken Cecilia Lind

Hon dansar och blundar så nära intill
Hon följer i dansen precis vart han vill
Han för och hon följer så lätt som en vind
Men säg, varför rodnar Cecilia Lind?

Säg, var det för det Fredrik Åkare sa?
""Du doftar så gott och du dansar så bra
Din midja är smal och barmen är trind
Vad du är vacker, Cecilia Lind""

Men dansen tog slut och vart skulle de gå?
De bodde så nära varandra ändå
Till slut kom de fram till Cecilias grind
""Nu vill jag bli kysst"", sa Cecilia Lind

Vet hut, Fredrik Åkare, skäms gamla karln
Cecilia Lind är ju bara ett barn
Ren som en blomma, skygg som en hind
""Jag fyller snart sjutton"", sa Cecilia Lind

Och stjärnorna vandra och timmarna fly
Och Fredrik är gammal men månen är ny
Ja, Fredrik är gammal men kärlek är blind
""Åh, kyss mig igen"", sa Cecilia Lind

Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe

When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on

And it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed

To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal

I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

So long, honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe

You could've done better, but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

465,Can't Take My Eyes off You,Solo,Frankie Valli,1967,203680,67,"

[Verse 1]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

[Verse 2]
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

[Chorus]
I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm the lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say:
Oh, pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby, let me love you

[Verse 3]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Can't take my eyes off you

466,Hurricane,Desire,Bob Dylan,1976-01-16,512733,69,"

[Verse 1]
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”

[Hook]
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Verse 2]
Three bodies lyin' there
Does Patty see
And another man named Bello
Moving around mysteriously
“I didn’t do it,” he says
And he throws up his hands
“I was only robbin' the register
I hope you understand

[Verse 3]
I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“One of us had better call up the cops”
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night

[Verse 4]
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

[Verse 5]
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that’s just the way things go
If you’re black
You might as well not show up on the street
Unless you want to draw the heat

[Verse 6]
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
He said, “I saw two men running out
They looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”

[Verse 7]
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men

[Verse 8]
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
They take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Says, “Why did you bring him in here for?
He ain't the guy!”

[Hook]
Here’s the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Verse 9]
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin’s in South America, fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame

[Verse 10]
“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw
Running that night?”
“Don’t forget that you are white”

[Verse 11]
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
The cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
And we’re talking to your friend Bello
Now you don’t want to have to go back to jail
Be a nice fellow

[Verse 12]
You’ll be doing society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder
On him
He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”

[Verse 13]
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
""It’s my work"", he’d say, ""and I do it for pay
And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way""

[Verse 14]
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man
Into a mouse

[Verse 15]
All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus
He never had a chance
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses
Drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
He was a revolutionary bum

[Verse 16]
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one
Who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

[Verse 17]
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder “one,”
Guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

[Verse 18]
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land
Where justice is a game

[Verse 19]
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink Martinis
And watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha
In a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell

[Outro]
Yes that’s the story of the Hurricane
But it won’t be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he’s done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Somliga går med trasiga skor
Säg, vad beror det på?
Gudfader som i himmelen bor
Kanske vill ha det så

Gudfader som i himmelen bor
Blundar och sover sött
Vem bryr sig om ett par trasiga skor
När man är gammal och trött?

Vem bryr sig om hur dagarna går?
De vandrar som de vill
Medborgare, om ett hundra år
Finns du ej längre till

Då har nån annan tagit din stol
Det vet du inte av
Du känner varken regn eller sol
Ner i din mörka grav

Vem bryr sig om hur nätterna far?
Jag bryr mig inte ett spår
Bara jag får ha mitt ansikte kvar
Dolt i min älsklings hår

Jag är en tvivelaktig figur
Duger ej mycket till
Bakom ett hörn står döden på lur
Han tar mig när han vill

Somliga går med trasiga skor
Tills de har slutat gå
Djävulen som i helvetet bor
Får sig ett gott skratt då

Of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips now baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah

And baby, And baby, I would rather, I would rather be blind boy
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Better stop dreaming of the quiet life
'Cos it's the one we'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus
'Cos those rosey days are few
And...stop apologising for the things you've never done
'Cos time is short and life is cruel
But it's up to us to change
This town called Malice

[Verse 2]
Rows and rows of disused milk floats
Stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives
Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing
When tears come fast and furious
In a town called Malice
Ye-eh-eah

Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah
Bah-bah-bah-ba-baba-bah, oh

Struggle after struggle, year after year
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice
I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah

A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids' new gear
It's a big decision in a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah

[Verse 4]
The ghost of a steam train echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going 'round and 'round, oh
Playground kids and creaking swings
Lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will
But I'd sooner put some joy back
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah (uhuhuh)
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah
In this town called Malice, uhuh-yeah

I was twenty-one years when I wrote this song
I'm twenty-two now, but I won't be for long
People ask me when will I grow up to understand
Why the girls I knew at school are already pushing prams

I loved you then as I love you still
Though I put you on a pedestal, you put me on the pill
I don't feel bad about letting you go
I just feel sad about letting you know

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?

I loved the words you wrote to me
But that was bloody yesterday
I can't survive on what you send
Every time you need a friend

I saw two shooting stars last night
I wished on them, but they were only satellites
It's wrong to wish on space hardware
I wish, I wish, I wish you'd care

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?

My dreams were full of strange ideas
My mind was set despite the fears
But other things got in the way
I never asked that boy to stay

Once upon a time at home
I sat beside the telephone
Waiting for someone to pull me through
When at last it didn't ring, I knew it wasn't you

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another?

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
Are you looking for another girl?
Looking for another girl
Looking for another girl
Looking for another girl

And a lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, ""You and me babe, how about it?""
""You and me babe, how about it?""

And now the marriage vow is very sacred
The man has put us together now
You ought to make it stick together
Come on, come on, let's stick together
You know we made a vow not to leave one another never

But now you never miss your water till your well runs dry
Come on now baby give our love a try
Let's stick together
Come on, come on, let's stick together
You know we made a vow not to leave one another never

Well if you're stuck for a while consider our child
How can it be happy without its ma and pa

Whoo!

What is happening here
Something going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the light
We're gonna have a party, it's starting tonight

Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling

The room is hot and that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
The people starting to climb the walls

Out on the wily, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you, I loved you too

Bad dreams in the night
They told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering

Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy

Let me in-a-your window

Ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back, love, cruel Heathcliff
My one dream, my only master

Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

Pearl's a singer
She stands up when she plays the piano
In a nightclub
Pearl's a singer
She sings songs for the lost and lonely
Her job is entertaining folks
Singing songs and telling jokes
In a nightclub
Pearl's a singer
And they say that she once was a winner
In a contest
Pearl's a singer
And they say that she once cut a record
They played it for a week or so
On the local radio
It never made it
She wanted to be Betty Grable
But now she sits there at that beer stained table
Dreaming of the things she never got to do
All those dreams that never came true
Pearl's a singer
She stands up when she plays the piano
In a nightclub
Pearl's a singer
She sings songs for the lost and the lonely
Her job is entertaining folks
Singing songs and telling jokes

In my mind there's a face
On my lips there's a name
In my life there's no place
For the man that I love
Cause I'm livin' my life
Just to sing and be free

From L.A. to New York, from New York to L.A

From New York to L.A

I'm a star in New York, I'm a star in L.A
In my life there's no place for the man that I love
Cause I'm livin my life just to sing and be free

From LA to New York, from New York to LA

The city life of flashing lights
Busy streets and fancy cars
Booze and drugs and all the clubs
Everyone's a shining star

Was so inviting to my eyes
That I can only be surprised
By all the sounds and sights to see
I thought all this was meant for me
But was it really meant for me?

I'm a star in New York, I'm a star in L.A
In my life there's no place for the man that I love
Cause I'm livin' my life just to sing and be free

From L.A. to New York, from New York to L.A

The city lights are often blurred
By stories we've already heard
Booze and drugs now break my head
Cause all the shining stars are dead

I sometimes close my tired eyes
Look at myself, be hyptnotized
Findin' a reason of lovin' you
The man I thought was meant for me
But were you really meant for me?

I'm a star in New York, I'm a star in L.A
In my life there's no place for the man that I love
Cause I'm livin' my life just to sing and be free

Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach

The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

[Chorus 1]
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Verse 2]
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm going to show you what I'm made of

[Chorus 2]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

[Chorus 3]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the
Radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Chorus 4]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I know it's out of fashion
And a trifle uncool
But I can't help it
I'm a romantic fool
It's a habit of mine
To watch the sun go down
On Echo Beach, I watch the sun go down

From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach someday

On a silent summer evening
The sky's alive with lights
A building in the distance
Surrealistic sight
On Echo Beach
Waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach
There's not a soul around

From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach someday

491,Through the Barricades,The Collection,Spandau Ballet,2015-07-10,356080,28,"

Mother doesn't know where love has gone
She says it must be youth that keeps us feeling strong
See it in her face that's turned to ice
And when she smiles
She shows the lines of sacrifice

And now I know what they're saying
As our sun begins to fade
And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades

Father made my history
He fought for what he thought would set us somehow free
He taught me what to say in school

I learned it off by heart
But now that's torn in two
And now I know what they're saying
In the music of the parade
And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades

Born on different sides of life
But we feel the same and feel all of this strife
So come to me when I'm asleep
And we'll cross the line and dance upon the streets

And now I know what they're saying
As the drums begin to fade
And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades

Oh, turn around and I'll be there
Well there's a scar right through my heart
But I'll bare it again
Oh, I thought we were the human race
But we were just another borderline case

And the stars reach down
And tell us that there's always one escape
Oh, I don't know where love has gone
And in this troubled land desperation keeps us strong

Friday's child is full of soul
With nothing left to lose
There's everything to go
And now I know what they're saying
It's a terrible beauty we've made
So we make our love on wasteland and through the barricades

And now I know what they're saying
As our hearts go to their graves
And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades

Don't you feel it growing, day by day
People getting ready for the news
Some are happy, some are sad

I talked to my baby on the telephone long distance
I never would've guessed I could miss someone so bad, yeah

[Chrous]
I really only met her 'bout a week ago

To wait for the bell to ring
T'ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell

Aggravated
I spare for days
I troll downtown
The red light place
I jump up, bubble up
What's in store?
Love is the drug
And I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl
Where the beat goes on

Stitched up tight
Can't shake free
Love is the drug
Got a hook on me

I parked my car
Staked my place
In the singles bar
Face to face
Toe to toe
Heart to heart
As we hit the floor

Lumbered up, limbo down
The locked embrace
The stumble round
I say ""go,"" she say ""yes""
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest

495,Morning Train (Nine to Five),Greatest Hits,Sheena Easton,1995-04-01,200973,48,"

I wake up every mornin', I stumble out of bed
Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly

'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant
To go slow dancing, anything I want
Only when he's with me, I catch light
Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me)
When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

(My baby takes the morning train)
He's always on that morning train
(He works from nine to five and then)
He works so hard
(He takes another home again)
To find me waiting for him

(My baby takes the morning train)
(He works from nine to five and then)
(He takes another home again)

It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

[Verse 5]
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole

And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last

Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
""We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing""

There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

[Chorus]
What's love got to do ooh , got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

[Outro]
What's love?
Got to do it
Got to do it
What's love?

[Verse 1]
Shooting stars in midnight pastures
And hanging out on clouds beneath the moon
Hitching rides on magic carpets
It's a fairy tale to me but you're in tune

You're shattered by the final frame
Of the movie scene that generates your every aim
You ain't no bird and so for what it s worth
Gonna bring you straight back down down

[Chorus]
Straight back down
Come back down
Straight back down
Straight back down to earth

[Verse 2]
In times when you're in need of assistance
You're looking for a lead and in the distance
You hear them calling come back down again
But you don't know how, you don't know where and don't know when

You're shattered by the final frame
Of the movie scene that generates your every aim
You ain't no bird and so for what it s worth
Gonna bring you straight back down to earth

[Chorus]
Straight back down
Come back down
Straight back down
Straight back down to earth

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
You feel at ease you're begging please don't take me down for nothing

Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
You feel at ease you're begging please don't take me down for nothing

You're shattered by the vital pain
That is needed now to tell you not to go insane
You're tempted by, I say the cooling breeze
That will bring you down oh come back please!

[Chorus]
Straight back down
Come back down
Straight back down
Straight back down to earth

[Verse 4]
Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
You feel at ease you're begging please don't take me down for nothing

Don't wanna wanna be misled
Don't wanna fall on a razor's edge and
You feel at ease you're begging please don't take me down for nothing...

[Verse 1]
They passed me by, all of those great romances
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

[Chorus]
One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

[Verse 2]
I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving

[Pre-Chorus]
That's how I started the show, one of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

[Chorus]
One of us is crying, one of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
(One of us is shaking with a heart that’s breaking)
One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

Never left at all

Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead

One of us is lonely, one of us is only
Waiting for a call...

And lovers await the break of the day?
Why do they fall in love?

Love is a losing game
And love can be a shame

For that fool is me

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Baby baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet

But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over)
Haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her, maybe one or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?

This time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over)
Haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid of losing you forever

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart (Baby, think it over)
Stop in the name of love (Think it over, baby)
Before you break my heart (Ooh, think it over, baby)

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love

517,Love Changes (Everything),Everything,Climie Fisher,1988-03-14,268186,64,"

I was only seventeen when she looked at me that way
Seems like yesterday
I was only fooling round but she stole my heart away
I've never been the same

I felt the strangest feeling
Like a raging fire it burned
She left, I cried for weeks
And I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings, oho

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

Then the years went rolling by, I grew up and moved away
Had to earn my pay
Found another lover then but my heart is sad to say
It only ended up the same way

And I wondered: was I destined to spend my life alone?
Oh, girl, you answered my question
This time it's working, you've given me new hope

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

I've seen the way love shakes you, makes you, breaks you
It's got a power of its own

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings
Don't forget it, girl

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Don't you forget it, baby
Love changes everything

(Love makes you fly) Flying away, oho
(Love changes) Let's make love
(Love changes everything) Oh

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings
Don't forget it, girl (Love changes)
Don't you forget it, baby
Love changes everything

How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy

The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long
Won't be long 'til summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

521,Baker Street - Edit,Baker Street,Gerry Rafferty,1998,247795,41,"

Winding your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well, another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people, but it's got no soul
And it's taken you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're trying, you're trying now
Another year and then you'd be happy
Just one more year and then you'd be happy
But you're crying, you're crying now

Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door, he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen
And you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one-night stands
And then he'll settle down
In some quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone
And when you wake up, it's a new morning
The sun is shining, it's a new morning
And you're going, you're going home

The marchin' band came down along Main Street
The soldier-blues fell in behind
I looked across and there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line

And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancee
From where I stood I saw she was cryin'
And through her tears I heard her say:

""Billy, don't be a hero, don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero, come back and make me your wife""
And as Billy started to go she said: ""Keep your pretty head low
Billy, don't be a hero, come back to me""

The soldier-blues were trapped on a hillside
The battle raging all around
The sergeant cried: ""We've gotta hang on, boys
We've gotta hold this piece of ground

I need a volunteer to ride out
And bring us back some extra men""
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgettin' all the words she said. She said:

""Billy, don't be a hero, don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero, come back and make me your wife""
And as Billy started to go she said: ""Keep your pretty head low
Billy, don't be a hero, come back to me""

I heard his fiancee got a letter
That told how Billy died that day
The letter said that he was a hero
She should be proud he died that way
I heard she threw the letter away

Where am I, how did I get here?
Today is very different than yesterday
So this is the world?  I miss my old womb
The wallpaper here just ain't the same

This world is something strange
I'm wet, I'm cold, I need a change
This world is something new to me

Oh, my head! What is this? I can't take it!
Me either!

I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm irritated
But I love the extra leg room
Man! They cut my cord!
Consider yourself lucky!

This world is way too big
And populated by fuzzy pigs
This world is something new to me

This world is such a gas
P.U., where's your class?
This world is something new to me

Quiet! can't a guy get some shuteye?
It's so noisy in here
I can barely hear myself suck

The food here tastes pretty good
My compliments to the chef
And you gotta holler to get fed
But I could get used to that

This world is way too bright
Can't somebody turn down the light?
So that's what that thing looks like

All things here are meant for play
It's gonna be a real cool day
This world is something new to me

This world is something new to me

Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes

Banking off of the northeast winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Wah, wah wah-wah wah

Well, he's Trekkie Monster, and you're Kate Monster

[Kate]
Right

You're both Monsters

[Kate]
Yeah

Are you two related?

[Kate]
What? Princeton! I'm surprised at you! I find that racist

[Princeton]
Oh, well, I'm sorry, I was just asking

[Kate]
Well, it's a touchy subject
No, not all monsters are related
What are you trying say, huh?
That we all look the same to you?
Huh, huh, huh?

[Princeton]
No, no, no, oh, not at all
I'm sorry, I guess that was a little racist

I should say so
You should be much more careful

Admitting it is not an easy thing to do

[Princeton]
But I guess it's true

[Kate]
Between me and you

[Both]
I think everyone's a little bit racist sometimes
Doesn't mean we go around committing hate crimes
Look around and you will find
No one's really color blind
Maybe it's a fact we all should face
Everyone makes judgments based on race

[Princeton]
No, not big judgments, like who to hire
Or who to buy a newspaper from

[Kate]
No

[Princeton]
No, just little judgments like thinking that Mexican
Busboys should learn to speak goddamn English!

[Kate]
Right!

[Both]
Everyone's a little bit racist today
So, everyone's a little bit racist, okay
Ethnic jokes might be uncouth
But you laugh because they're based on truth
Don't take them as personal attacks
Everyone enjoys them, so relax

[Princeton]
All right, stop me if you've heard this one

Okay!

And there's only one parachute
And there's a rabbi, a priest

Yeah, I know

The Jews have all the money
And the whites have all the power
And I'm always in taxi cab
With driver who no shower

Me too

Me too

I can't even get a taxi!

532,When a Man Loves a Woman,When a Man Loves a Woman,Percy Sledge,1966,173866,66,"

When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause baby, baby, you're my world

When a man loves a woman...

Out through the back yard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows, to my surprise

Was the son of a preacher man

Bein' good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come'n tell me ""Everything is all right""
He'd kiss and tell me ""Everything is all right""
Can I get away again tonight?

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man

How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we've grown and

The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man

But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it

With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

To be on your own
With no direction home

Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home

They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home

[Chorus]
So won't you, please
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby
(My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darlin'
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I'll make you happy, baby, just wait and see
For every kiss you give me, I'll give you three
Oh, since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you 'til eternity

[Chorus]
So won't you, please
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby
(My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darlin'
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
So c'mon and be
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby
(My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darlin'
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby
(My one and only baby)
Oh-oh-oooooh
(Be my, be my baby)
Ooooooooooh
Wha-oh-oh-oh-oh

(Be my, be my baby)
Oh-oh-oooooh
(My one and only baby)
Ooooooooooh
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh

[Hook]
You better think (think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

[Verse 1]
Let's go back, let's go back
Let's go way on way back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't have been too much more than ten (just a child)
I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degrees
But it don't take too much high IQ to see what you're doing to me

[Hook]
You better think (think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

[Chorus]
'Cause freedom (freedom)
Stands for freedom (freedom)
Oh freedom
Yeah freedom, right now
Freedom (freedom)
Oh oh freedom (freedom)
Give me some freedom
Oh oh freedom, right now

[Link]
Yeah, think about it!
You, think about it!

[Verse 2]
There ain't nothing you could ask
I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
But I was gonna change, but I'm not
If you keep doing things I don't

[Hook]
You better think (think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Oh oh-oh-oh think (What you're tryna to do to me)
(Think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

[Verse 3]
People walking around everyday
Playing games and taking scores
Trying to make other people lose their minds
Well, be careful, you're goin' to lose yours

[Chorus]
Oh, think (think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Wooh! Think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

[Bridge]
You need me (need me)
And I need you (don't you know?)
Without each other
There ain't nothing neither can do

[Outro to fade]
Oh yeah, think about me
(What you're tryin' do to me)
When I'm gone baby
Think about it right now
Yeah, right now
(Think about, forgiveness) Oh
(Think about, forgiveness) Yeah right now
(Think about, forgiveness)
(Think about it ) Please baby, baby, baby
(Think about, forgiveness) Oh, think about baby
(Think about, forgiveness) Yeah, ooh...
(Think about, forgiveness)

{​*scratching*}​
""Go for mine,  and run down the line""
{​*scratching*}​
""Go for mine, and run down the line""

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I went from construction Timbs to Ac's with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's that superstar status apparatus, more wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline
I want a presidential Rollie (So)
So I crush MCs to guacamole, making Robin scream, ""Holy moley!""
Big Poppa, fuck a cape, I'm that Paper Crusader
Playing Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Verse 2: Coolio]
I shot dice with a priest and drank yak with a pastor
So it's me, myself and I know, my own lord and master
When your ass was born, it was all on the lone, and
When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

[Break 1: Easy Mo Bee]
{​*scratching*}​
""Go for mine,  and run down the line""
{​*scratching*}​
""Go for mine, and run down the line""

[Verse 3: Redman]
It's that Funkadelic Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the vest, niggas better start putting on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk coming in stacks, bullets humming from gats
So I duck, lyrical BUCK BUCK, get stuck
I'm jamming like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
BLADOW! Plus my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang, burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leaving your mic boney like that Tales Of The Crypt bitch (Uh!)
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, I'm busting your ass, counterclockwise
I get Dumb but Dumber, why your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo-ooh-sers

[Verse 4: Ill Al Skratch]
Ayo, Mayday, mayday, raise the white flag
Let the pants sag, fuck the drag (I'm a puff the whole bag)
It's the low down and I'm low-key, the O.G
Niggas know me (True) so take it easy with stakes

[Verse 5: Big Mike]
It ain't surprising these motherfuckers still hating
They must don't know I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike will stomp the head of a snake
Now quakes was felt when my feet hit the ground
And fate is fatal when my heat made a sound
Now, how did I relate what's gonna fall
When my niggas made the fucking final call

[Chorus: Ill Al Skratch]
It ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like that

[Break 2: Easy Mo Bee]
""For my one true""
""Our run's our rhyme""
""For my one""
{​*scratching*}​
""One true""
""For my one true""
""Our run""
""Our run""

[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]
Hey, you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You best believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around, my people start subtracting
They cause this shit, then they wonder why we start overreacting
Hey, ay, ay, you can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'm a hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me go inside, ""Please give me room, yo step aside""
Ha, those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there dropping dimes
Get your shit drawers up out my hammer
Young survivalist represent the next Black Panther

[Verse 7: Buckshot]
I stepped in the jam with the guard on my side
And the guard S.T. is still waiting in the ride
So I stepped to the DJ and told the DJ
""Yo, throw the wax on"" ""How many emcees must get dissed""

[Verse 8: Layzie Bone]
Putting your shit to the pave, ending 'em meeting the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazing, nothing phased
Bone, my deadly fist of brothers, ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, you dearly departed, better off

[Verse 9: Wish Bone]
Living the psycho path so I'm down with a buck and a blast and getting my chance
You niggas are fearing my sawed-off
Blew thee to rest, so fast to blast
So if you, thinking defeat, you need, to best, be packing your shit, you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cuz, when we a done with the quickness

[Verse 10: Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, bucking em once a
Gain enough to pick a defender
They try to contend us, see, all they gon' win is that Mac-10
There's never another to go with a brother, while smotherin' suckas been gon' undercover
We leave em in gutters, ain’t gonna get caught. But who was the sucker that squealed on a murda?

[Verse 11: Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street, sweeper, better R.I.P. and pray
The bullet don't put in much work but I'm a sure, with, shot
Puttin' the bullets just where it hurts, and um
With a me tech'll slip up one on the popos, Bone, Bone
Better be nothing to me, you set up, wet up
Get 'em on the get up, Bone won't let up

Hangul

편한 옷에 발엔 flip flop
둥근 식탁 위에 식사
이 판을 먹어치워 가볍게
그 다음엔 사이좋게 나눠내
N분의 1로

부디 건강하게만
자라다오라는 부모님 기대는
교복을 갈아 입고
야자시간이나 축내는 꿈 깨는
몇십만분의 일로
음악 하러 갈게 엄마
대학 때려치워버렸던 미래는
수입에 분배는 무슨
회사 돈이나 축내는
그룹의 그저 삼분의 일로

Ay 그걸로 값을 매겼다면
우찬아 미안 빙시새끼들이 과연
나의 잠재력에 토 달아댄다면 과연
가만히 보다는 갚아줘야 되기 마련
그래 자연스럽게 걔네 밥그릇들을 뺐지
구색 맞추기의 반찬들은 됐으니
전부 가져가면 되고 물은 따라놔야 해
너네 다 말아먹을 테니까

라이노 면도 준비됐음 쟤네꺼 다 먹어
너네 배고픈거 알아 beat 잡아 먹어
넉살이형은 마무리 설거지로 다 털어놔
Shot out to los 우리 재밌는거 벌여봐
여긴 경쟁이 아니야 나눠 먹는거지
우리끼리끼리끼리
준비됐으면 우찬아 보여줘 인마
Let’s get it get it get it

편한 옷에 발엔 flip flop
둥근 식탁 위에 식사
이 판을 먹어치워 가볍게
그 다음엔 사이좋게 나눠내

마음 같아선 내가 다 쏘고 싶지만
오늘은 전부 N분의 1빵
적절히 교차하는 여러 색깔들을 통해
너희 전부다 느껴 우린 개쩌는 집단
사이다는 내가 시켜 좀더 낼게
시원하게 마시고 쩌렁거리게 랩해
속 시원해지는 내 랩은 널 웃게 해
난 변하지 않으니 언제든 검색해

우찬이 매니져 불러둬 미리
아마 오늘은 벌어질 거야 웃기는 일이
시끄러운 너희들이 숨죽이는 일이
진하게 풍기는 향기 필요 없는 기믹
내가 뭘 말하든지
너흰 느껴 내가 얼마나 큰지
너흰 절망하든지
또 멸망하든지
신경 안 써 갈 길을 가
선망하든 원망하든지

이건 우리끼리 써낸 4WD 각자 멋을 맘껏 내
내 자리를 잡고 나를 완성해
많은 래퍼는 내게 의문 던졌네
내가 어떻게 여기까지 왔는지에 대해
설명해 달라하면 이 방법이 제일 멋지지
즐기는 내 모습을 보고 반성해
완성된 나의 Shiiitttttttttttt

라이노는 코뿔소
들이 받아 버려 다 겁을 줘
우리 승리의 컵을 줘
사이 좋게 먹자 우린 커플룩
사이즈는 더블로
우릴 비웃던 친구들 다 불러
여기 다듀형들 싸인 받아 줄께
이젠 잘봐 누가 사랑 받는지 주께

떠나고 싶어 피렌체로
일곱 조각짜리 피자로
치즈 늘어나게 나누다가
우찬이 한입 더
내일의 만찬은 지구 반대편
뱅기는 질리니까 크루즈 배편
돌아 보니 전설을 쓴 것 같아
그리스 로마 신화 속편

속 썩이던 아들내미에서
이젠 새 집에 달린 샹들리에를
샾에도 좀 들렸다가
가까운 곳에 예약했어
상어지느러미를
삶은 징그럽게 뺏었다가
도리어 나눌 상대를 주네
나의 목소리를 숨에 담아
나눠줄께 전세계를 순회

편한 옷에 발엔 flip flop
둥근 식탁 위에 식사

그 다음엔 사이좋게 나눠내

형아들 맞아 난 성장기라 배가 너무 고파
죽이는 냄새 맡고 왔어 어딘진 모르겠지만
지금 우리끼리 이미 준비된 만찬 같으니
식기 전에 빨리 먹자 N분에 1빵을 추구해
더 이상 나눌 건 없지 기약분수 a
행거칩은 안 해 식사예절 충분해
부럽고 분하면 빈둥대지 말고 찾아 너네 자리
여긴 꽉 차버렸어 so full

1차에선 눈들이 커지고
2차에선 입을 벌리고 소리를 질렀지
3차에선 제대로 즐겼고
책을 덮고 나온 어린애의 반란이었지
원래 난 쇼미 목걸이가 1드림이였어
꿈을 찾다 보니 여까지 왔네
그걸 거품이라 말한 놈들
야 원샷해

편한 옷에 발엔 flip flop
둥근 식탁 위에 식사
이 판을 먹어치워 가볍게

English Translation

Comfortable clothes, flip flops on my feet
Eating on a circular table
I’m lightly eating this up
Then I’ll fairly share
To 1 out of N

My parents only wanted me to be healthy
But I changed out of my uniform
And spent thousands of hours in night classes or breaking dreams
I’m gonna go make music, mom
I gave up college but did I make any money?
Yeah right, I was just 1/3 of a group
Who had to pay losses to the company
If I had to put a price on that
Woochan, sorry- if those idiots knew my potential
Instead of just watching, they should pay me back
Now I naturally steal their food bowls
Cuz now they’re just an assortment of side dishes
Just gotta take it all and pour out the water
Cuz I’m gonna eat you all up
Rino, Myundo, if you’re ready, eat theirs all up
I know you’re hungry, eat the beat
Nucksal hyung, do the dishes at the end
Shout out to Los, let’s do something fun
This isn’t a competition, this is sharing
Just among us
If you’re ready, Woochan, show us dude
Let’s get it get it get it

Comfortable clothes, flip flops on my feet
Eating on a circular table
I’m lightly eating this up
Then I’ll fairly share
To 1 out of N

If I could, I’d treat you all but
Today, it’s 1 out of N
Through all the colors mixing
I feel you all, we’re a killer group
I ordered the coke, I’ll pay a bit more
Cuz my rap will clear up your insides and make you laugh
I won’t change, always look me up
Woochan, call up your manager ahead of time
Today, something funny’s gonna happen
Something to hush you loud ones up
A thickly spreading scent, don’t need a gimmick
Whatever I say
You can feel how big I am
You can despair or fail
I don’t care, I’ll go my way
You can be jealous, you can resent me
This is a 4WD we wrote, each of us so fly
I take my place and I complete it
A lot of rappers questioned me
About how I came this far
If you want me to explain, this is the best way
Look at how I enjoy my life and reflect
My completed shiiiiiiiitt

Rino with your horn
Trample them all, give them fear
Give us the cup of victory
Let’s drink from it fairly
We have couple looks, sizes double
Call all your friends who laughed at us
I’ll give them Dynamic Duo’s autograph
Now look who receives love here
I wanna go to Firenze
With seven pieces of pizza
We’ll share with the cheese hanging
Woochan, take one more bite
Tomorrow’s feast will take place on the other side of the earth
Sick of airplanes, let’s take a cruise
I look back and saw I wrote a legend
A Greek or Roman myth
I used to be a troublemaker son
Now I hang new chandeliers at home
I went to the shop and reserved a place nearby
For shark fin soup
Life disgustingly takes away
Then gives you people to share with
My voice is in my breath
And I’ll share it with the whole world

Comfortable clothes, flip flops on my feet
Eating on a circular table
I’m lightly eating this up
Then I’ll fairly share
To 1 out of N

To 1 out of N
To 1 out of N
To 1 out of N
To 1 out of N

Hyungs, that’s right, I’m so hungry cuz I’m going through puberty
I came here cuz of the killer smell, though I don’t know from where
This was a feast prepared for us
Now let’s eat before it gets cold, 1 out of N
Nothing more to share now, an irreducible fraction
Don’t need a handkerchief, I have enough table manners
If you’re jealous and mad, don’t be lazy, find your own spot
This place is full though, so full
First round, their eyes were big
Second round, they dropped their jaws and yelled
Third round, they fully enjoyed it
It was the rebellion of the young boy who flipped over his books
The Show Me necklace was my #1 dream
I searched for my dream and now I’m all the way here
All you who think that’s nothing but foam
Yo, one shot

Comfortable clothes, flip flops on my feet
Eating on a circular table
I’m lightly eating this up
Then I’ll fairly share
To 1 out of N

To 1 out of N
To 1 out of N
To 1 out of N
To 1 out of N

[Verse 1]
Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night, and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence""

The tax man's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everythin' I've got
All I've got's this sunny afternoon

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I've got a big fat momma tryin' to break me

And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime

[Verse 2]
My girlfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to her ma and pa
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty

Now I'm sitting here
Sipping at my ice cold beer
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

[Chorus]
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well, give me two good reasons why I ought to stay

'Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime

Oh, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I've got a big fat momma tryin' to break me

And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury

To ease my mind
I need to find, find
Someone to call mine

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

[Verse 1]
But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Yeah, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

[Chorus]
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break?

[Verse 2]
No I can't bear
To live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love
To call my own
But when I feel that I
I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hangin' on

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy

No, love, love
Don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating
For that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
I keep on waiting (Ooh, until that day)
But it ain't easy
It ain't easy
But mama said

You can't hurry love

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods...

[ANNIE (spoken)]
Jack, hurry up! Come on!

[JACK (spoken)]
Just a second. Sugar maple...

[MORGAN (sung)]
On a day just like any other

[ANNIE]
What're you doing?

[JACK]
Making notes. Rough bark...

[MORGAN]
In the woods not very far from home

[ANNIE]
Jack! I'm a monster!

[JACK]
Star-shaped leaves...

[MORGAN]
As they walk, a sister and brother...

[ANNIE]
Grrrrrr!!!

[JACK]
Annie, cut it out!

[ANNIE]
Oh, come on, Jack! Play with me!

[MORGAN]
Argue

[JACK]
No! I'm too old to play pretend

[ANNIE]
No you're not!

[JACK]
Yes I am!

[ANNIE]
Are not!

[JACK]
Am too!

[MORGAN]
But today what they say doesn't matter

[ANNIE]
Jack, it's not pretend! I'm a monster!

[MORGAN]
For today in the woods they're not alone

[ANNIE]
Jack, look!

[JACK]
Annie, stop!

[MORGAN]
Today at the top of a ladder

[ANNIE]
No, really! Look!

[JACK]
Where?

[ANNIE]
Over there!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[MORGAN]
There's a magic place where wishes can come true

How far can you see

[ANNIE]
I'm climbing up!

[JACK]
Annie, don't! We don't know who it belongs to!

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[JACK]
Annie!

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
What?

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[ANNIE]
It's full of books!

[JACK]
Really?

[ANNIE]
Yes! Look!

[MORGAN]
When you venture outside your window

[ANNIE]
Books about knights! Ninjas! And...oh, wow!

[JACK]
What?

[ANNIE]
Dinosaurs!

[JACK]
Hold on, I'm coming up!

[ANNIE (sung)
Books about faraway places
Pictures of wondrous sights to see

[MORGAN]
To go there, all that it takes is wishing

[ANNIE (spoken)]
See?

[MORGAN]
A wish to have an adventure

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[MORGAN]
A wish from the top of a tree

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[MORGAN]
A wish to be there -- and then you're flying

What happened?

[JACK]
I...I don't know

[ANNIE]
Where are we?

[JACK]
How're we going to get home?

[ANNIE]
We can worry about that later! Come on!

Annie, wait! I'm coming!

[MORGAN (spoken)]
That day, Jack and Annie discovered that the Tree House is magic -- and later they found out that it belongs to me, Morgan le Fay, of Camelot. Since that first day in the woods, they have had many wondrous adventures...and we have become friends...

[ANNIE]
Morgan! Hi!

[MORGAN]
Welcome back! Did you have fun?

[JACK]
Yep. We did

[ANNIE]
And look what we brought you!

[JACK]
It's a mango! From a rainforest!

[ANNIE]
And a moonstone! From a real ninja!

[JACK]
And look! A mammoth bone from the Ice Age!

[ANNIE]
This is the best summer we've ever had!

[JACK and ANNIE (sung)]
We saw dinosaurs before dark

[JACK]
A knight at dawn

[ANNIE]
We only had to make a wish

[JACK]
And whoosh! We were gone!
To visit mummies in the morning

[ANNIE]
Sail with pirates past noon

[JACK and ANNIE]
We're going out for a minute, Mom
We'll be home soon!

[JACK]
After a night of ninjas
Back in old Japan

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[ANNIE]
Or an afternoon on the Amazon

[JACK]
With crocodiles and monkeys and a big python!

[ANNIE]
Yikes!

[JACK]
We might set out through the ice and snow

[ANNIE]
To see the sun set on a sabertooth
A million years ago

[JACK and ANNIE]
Or maybe even travel
Far above the world we know
Arrive at midnight on the moon
And watch the earth revolve below!

In the Tree House there's no limit
If we wish it when we're in it
And the magic starts to spin it
There's no limit, just no limit
There's no limit to the places we can go!

[MORGAN (sung)]
How far can you see

[ANNIE]
My brother and me

[JACK]
My sister and me

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

From the top of a tree?

Yeah! And visiting the tigers, and the kangaroos...

[JACK]
And the gorillas!

The ghost town was scary, too

You, my brown-eyed girl

To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding

Behind the stadium with you

Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's that superstar status apparatus, more wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline
I want a presidential Rollie (So)
So I crush MCs to guacamole, making Robin scream, ""Holy moley!""
Big Poppa, fuck a cape, I'm that Paper Crusader
Playing Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Verse 2: Coolio]
I shot dice with a priest and drank yak with a pastor
So it's me, myself and I know, my own lord and master
When your ass was born, it was all on the lone, and
When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

It's that Funkadelic Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the vest, niggas better start putting on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk coming in stacks, bullets humming from gats
So I duck, lyrical BUCK BUCK, get stuck
I'm jamming like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
BLADOW! Plus my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang, burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leaving your mic boney like that Tales Of The Crypt bitch (Uh!)
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, I'm busting your ass, counterclockwise
I get Dumb but Dumber, why your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo-ooh-sers

[Verse 4: Ill Al Skratch]
Ayo, Mayday, mayday, raise the white flag
Let the pants sag, fuck the drag (I'm a puff the whole bag)
It's the low down and I'm low-key, the O.G
Niggas know me (True) so take it easy with stakes

[Verse 5: Big Mike]
It ain't surprising these motherfuckers still hating
They must don't know I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike will stomp the head of a snake
Now quakes was felt when my feet hit the ground
And fate is fatal when my heat made a sound
Now, how did I relate what's gonna fall
When my niggas made the fucking final call

All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You best believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around, my people start subtracting
They cause this shit, then they wonder why we start overreacting
Hey, ay, ay, you can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'm a hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me go inside, ""Please give me room, yo step aside""
Ha, those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there dropping dimes
Get your shit drawers up out my hammer

I stepped in the jam with the guard on my side
And the guard S.T. is still waiting in the ride
So I stepped to the DJ and told the DJ
""Yo, throw the wax on"" ""How many emcees must get dissed""

Putting your shit to the pave, ending 'em meeting the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazing, nothing phased

Put 'em all in a coffin, you dearly departed, better off

[Verse 9: Wish Bone]
Living the psycho path so I'm down with a buck and a blast and getting my chance
You niggas are fearing my sawed-off
Blew thee to rest, so fast to blast
So if you, thinking defeat, you need, to best, be packing your shit, you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cuz, when we a done with the quickness

[Verse 10: Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, bucking em once a
Gain enough to pick a defender
They try to contend us, see, all they gon' win is that Mac-10

Washed his hands and sealed his fate

And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

[Verse 2]
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

[Chorus 2]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""

The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue

573,The Sound of Silence,The Graduate,Simon & Garfunkel,1968-01-21,185440,0,"

[Verse 1]
Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night, and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence""

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go
Go go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go

So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you

And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes

[Chorus]
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

[Verse 2]
This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time

[Bridge]
Oh (magic)
Oh (magic)
Mmm (magic)

[Chorus]
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

[Verse 2]
This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time

[Outro]
(Magic) Oh
(Magic) Magic moment
(Magic) Magic moment
(Magic) Magic moment

(Magic) Oh
(Magic) Oh
(Magic)
(Magic)

Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay

When the stars make you drool
Just like a pasta e fasule, that's amore
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love

When you walk in a dream
But you know, you're not dreaming, signore
Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli, that's amore

597,Beyond the Sea,That's All,Bobby Darin,1959,172480,67,"

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'd go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
We'll meet (I know we'll meet) beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

No more sailing
So long sailing
Bye, bye sailing...

602,Night Moves,Night Moves,Bob Seger,1976-10-22,324422,70,"

[Intro]
I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly renown
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own, sitting way up high

[Chorus]
Way up firm and high
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on our night moves
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves in the summertime
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love oh no far from it
We weren't searchin’ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods
I used her she used me
But neither one cared
We were getting our share

Workin' on our night moves
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
And it was summertime
Mhm, sweet summer time, summer time

[Bridge]
And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in

[Outro]
Night Moves
Night moves (night moves)
Night moves (night moves)
Yeah, Remember, night moves
Sure do remember those night moves (night moves)
Ain't it funny how you remember (night moves)
Funny how you remember the night moves
I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember night whoa, whoa
It's works, working and practicing
Oh, on the night moves
Working and practicing....

Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in
And then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah

I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way

So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

Look like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

[Verse 3]
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Now, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Oooo-wee, sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

604,The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,Summertime Dream,Gordon Lightfoot,1976,389280,60,"

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy

With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the ""Gales of November"" came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And ev'ry man knew, as the captain did too
'twas the ""Witch of November"" come stealin'

The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the Gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough t'feed ya""
At seven P.M. a main hatchway caved in; he said
""Fellas, it's bin good t'know ya!""

The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind 'er

They might have split up or they might have capsized;
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams;
The islands and bays are for sportsmen

And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the Gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the ""Maritime Sailors' Cathedral""
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call Gitche Gumee
""Superior,"" they said, ""never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early!""

That could happen just once in a life time

Well the South side of Chicago
Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there
You better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown

Now Leroy more than trouble
You see he stand 'bout six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him ""Treetop Lover""
All the men just call him ""Sir""

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Now Leroy he a gambler
And he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Well Friday bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And ooh that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
Leroy Brown he learned a lesson
'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Well the two men took to fightin'
And when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

And he’s bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

The night was clear
And the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark

It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven
Billy swore that he threw eight

Stagger Lee told Billy
""I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money
And my brand new Stetson hat.""

Stagger Lee started off
Goin down that railroad track
He said, I can't get you Billy
But don't be here when I come back

Go on, Stagger Lee

Stagger Lee went home
And he got his .44
Said, ""I'm going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt I owe.""

Stagger Lee went to the bar room
And he stood across the bar room door
Said, ""Now nobody move.""
And he pulled his .44

""Stagger Lee,"" cried Billy
""Oh, please don't take my life
I got three little children
And a very sickly wife.""

Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh he shot that poor boy so bad
Till the bullet came through Billy
And it broke the bartender's glass

Oh the shark, babe
Has such teeth, dear
And he shows them
Pearly white
Just a jackknife
Has old Macheath, babe
And he keeps it
Out of sight

You know when that shark bites
With his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows
Start to spread
Fancy gloves, though
Wears ol' Macheath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

Now, on the side walk, ooh Sunday morning, uh huh
Lies a body just oozing life. EEK!
And someone's sneaking round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat down by the river, don't you know
Where a cement bag's just a drooping on down
Oh that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten, ol' Mackie's back in town

Now did ya hear 'bout Louie Miller?
He disappeared, babe
After drawing out all his hard earned cash
And now Macheath spends, just like a sailor
Could it be, our boy's done something rash?

Now, Jenny Diver, Suky Tawdry
Oh, Miss Lotte Lenya, and ol' Lucy Brown
Oh the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mackie's back in town

I said, Jenny Diver, oh Suky Tawdry
Look out, Miss Lotte Lenya, and ol' Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mackie's back in town
Look out ol' Mackie is back!

Dust off the sun and moon and sing a song of cheer

Just fill your basket full of sandwiches and weenies
Then lock the house up, now you're set
And on the beach you'll see the girls in their bikinis
As cute as ever but they never get 'em wet

You'll wish that summer could always be here

Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer

Don't hafta tell a girl and fella about a drive-in
Or some romantic moon it seems
Right from the moment that those lovers start arrivin'
You'll see more kissin' (whistling) in the cars than on the screen

A Buddhist and a Baptist and a Jew
And he knows he shouldn't kill

Kill you for me my friend, and me for you

He's fighting for the USA
And he's fighting for the Russians
And he's fighting for Japan
And he thinks we'll put an end to war this way

And he's fighting for Democracy
He's fighting for the Reds
He says it's for the peace of all
He's the one who must decide
Who's to live and who's to die
And he never sees the writing on the wall

But without him
How would Hitler have condemned him at Libau?
Without him Caesar would have stood alone
He's the one who gives his body
As a weapon of the war
And without him all this killing can't go on

He's the Universal Soldier and he really is to blame
His orders come from far away no more
They come from here and there and you and me
And brothers can't you see
This is not the way we put the end to war

Sunshine came softly through my a-window today
Could've tripped out easy a-but I've a-changed my ways
It'll take time, I know it but in a while
You're gonna be mine, I know it, we'll do it in style
Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine

I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find
Everybody's hustlin' just to have a little scene
When I say we'll be cool I think that you know what I mean
We stood on a beach at sunset, do you remember when?
I know a beach where, baby, a-it never ends
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
Cause I made my mind up you're going to be mine
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now, baby, all that I can find

Superman or Green Lantern ain't got a-nothin' on me
I can make like a turtle and dive for your pearls in the sea, yeah!
A you-you-you can just sit there a-thinking on your velvet throne
'bout all the rainbows a-you can a-have for your own

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

[Chorus 1]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 2]
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 3]
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

[Chorus 3]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 4]
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home

Can you remember the times
That you have held your head high?
And told all your friends of your Indian claim
Proud good lady and proud good man
Some great-great-grandfather from Indian blood sprang
And you feel in your heart for these ones

[Verse 2]
Oh it's written in books and in songs
We've been mistreated and wronged
Well over and over I hear those same words
From you good lady and you good man
Well listen to me if you care where we stand
And you feel you're a part of these ones

[Verse 3]
When a war between nations is lost
The loser we know pays the cost
But even when Germany fell to your hands
Consider dear lady, consider dear man
You left them their pride and you left them their land
And what have you done to these ones?

[Verse 4]
Has a change come about my dear man?
Or are you still taking our lands
A treaty forever your senators sign
They do dear lady, they do dear man
And the treaties are broken again and again
And what will you do for these ones?

[Verse 5: Buffy Sainte-Marie]
Oh it's all in the past they will say
But it's still going on here today
The governments now want the Navaho land
That of the Inuit and the Cheyenne
It's here and it's now you can help us dear man
Now that the buffalo's gone

Listen to me, baby
It's my heart that's suffering, it's a-dying (help me, I'm suffering)

[Verse 1: Braille]
Yo, microphone master coming on the track
The loud speaker blaster, what they chasing after
That's the question, we're searching for answers
Does your path lead to life or disaster
You start running faster, who do you race against
The time in the hour glass is wearing thin
We're all wearing skin, we're all in this flesh
Acting like businessmen, but we got no business since
The wages of sin is death, we can't avoid it
Chase the American dream and get disappointed
What's the point of this, I try to point them
In the right direction, and the pastor anointed him
But he didn't feel it, maybe it's more than that
More than a feeling or emotion, more than a moment
How do you teach a man to be consistent
To see the big picture and refocus his vision
I'm fishing for clues in a big sea
This is the big leagues, so much bondage, I'm trying to get free
Rush hour traffic, I just wanna exit
I just wanna understand the meaning to the message
In the music, I wanna know the truth so I can take it
And spread it all over this heavy rotation

[Chorus]
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
The world keeps spinning, the world keeps spinning
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
We're underrated, we're highly anticipated
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
It's been a long time coming but we waited
Can you handle the weight, can you handle the weight
Can you handle this heavy rotation

[Verse 2: Sivion]
Sivion on this track again
I'm breaking bread with some brothers that are free from sin
Building bonds, though we utilizing beats and pens
Let this music make a change in the streets of men
As the world turns, let this guiding light be with you
And feed all my children with the wisdom to get through
The hurdles and the barriers from people that dis you
A poor self image and respect is the issue
Get a tissue cuz this dude ain't missing you
Or that crap rock you copped for me to listen to
Man, I'm fixing to get at you cuz my rhymes'll spit at you
With the truth and the proof that your vibe is pitiful
And miniscule, fool, fit the ridicule
Little bitty sounds just right for the kiddy pool
Use this gritty tool worldwide filling many shoes
Heavy rotate feel the great stop to many crews

[Chorus]
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
The world keeps spinning, the world keeps spinning
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
We're underrated, we're highly anticipated
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
It's been a long time coming but we waited
Can you handle the weight, can you handle the weight
Can you handle this heavy rotation

[Verse 3: Kaboose]
There's no time to waste so I find a place
That I can escape gravity's hold and find the brakes
And do what it takes
Life moves fast, it's not willing to wait
So you might go crash with every chance that you're willing to take
To fill in the blanks you gotta live it out, learn from mistakes
Enter this race and always run with passion
Take each breath cuz this could be your last one
Reach for the stars, you're the coming attraction
Life is too short, you gotta take action
Even when you fall and things are drastic
Pick yourself up and hit the gas quick
Hold on tight as you move through the traffic
With your aim steady, no hesitation
Let's get it moving in this heavy rotation

(One two, one two, the world keeps spinning)

[Chorus]
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
The world keeps spinning, the world keeps spinning
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
We're underrated, we're highly anticipated
It's the heavy ro, heavy ro, heavy rotation
It's been a long time coming but we waited
Can you handle the weight, can you handle the weight
Can you handle this heavy rotation

[Verse 1]
Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

[Chorus]
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

[Verse 2]
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

[Chorus]
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

[Bridge]
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you

[Verse 3]
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn; a bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

[Outro]
Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

[Verse 1]
Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

[Chorus]
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

[Verse 2]
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way

[Chorus]
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

[Verse 3]
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

[Chorus]
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

[Outro]
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now

Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feathered canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughin when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say, ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From Win and Lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In '65, I was seventeen and running up 101
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

[Chorus]
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

[Verse 2]
Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In '69, I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on

[Chorus]
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

[Bridge]
Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave

[Verse 3]
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them running too

[Chorus]
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

[Verse 4]
Honey, you really tempt me
You know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
(Running on)
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
(Running blind)
Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Thank you!

And I'm bound to keep on ridin'
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no

I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

Set out runnin' but I take my time

Just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, and the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Verse 1]
My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say ""I'm gonna be like you, Dad
You know I'm gonna be like you""

[Chorus]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home, Dad
I don't know when, but we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 2]
My son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw"", I said ""Not today
I got a lot to do"", he said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, ""I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home, Dad

You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 3]
Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
""Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while""
He shook his head and then said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later, can I have them please""

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home son
I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad
You know we'll have a good time then

[Verse 4]
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kid's got the flu
But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad
It's been sure nice talking to you""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
When you comin' home son
I don't know when, but we'll get together then, Dad

661,Taxi,Rhino Hi-Five: Harry Chapin,Harry Chapin,2005-03-15,406146,23,"

It was raining hard in 'Frisco
I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light

Oh, where you going to, my lady blue
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain
She just looked out the window, and said
""Sixteen Parkside Lane""

Something about her was familiar
I could swear I'd seen her face before
But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more

It took a while, but she looked in the mirror
And she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile, just the same
And she said, ""How are you Harry?""
I said, ""How are you Sue?
Through the too many miles
And the too little smiles
I still remember you.""

It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of the Dodge
The lesson hadn't gone too far
You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off to find the sky

Oh, I've got something inside me
To drive a princess blind
There's a wild man, wizard
He's hiding in me, illuminating my mind
Oh, I've got something inside me
Not what my life's about
Cause I've been letting my outside tide me
Over 'till my time, runs out

Baby's so high that she's skying
Yes she's flying, afraid to fall
I'll tell you why baby's crying
Cause she's dying, aren't we all

There was not much more for us to talk about
Whatever we had once was gone
So I turned my cab into the driveway
Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns
And she said we must get together
But I knew it'd never be arranged
And she handed me twenty dollars
For a two fifty fare, she said
""Harry, keep the change.""
Well another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go...
I stashed the bill in my shirt

And she walked away in silence
It's strange, how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long, long time ago

You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off for the sky
And here, she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flying in my taxi
Taking tips, and getting stoned
I go flying so high, when I'm stoned

Again, I would spend them with you

And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty, except for the memory of how
They were answered by you

Well the South side of Chicago
Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there
You better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown

Now Leroy more than trouble
You see he stand 'bout six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him ""Treetop Lover""
All the men just call him ""Sir""

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Now Leroy he a gambler
And he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Well Friday bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And ooh that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
Leroy Brown he learned a lesson
'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

Well the two men took to fightin'
And when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

And he’s bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong
Meaner than a junkyard dog

He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin’ home to a place he’d never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin’ by a song
But the string’s already broken and he doesn’t really care
It keeps changin’ fast and it don’t last for long

[Chorus]
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)

[Verse]
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept the memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)

Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of the simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down
To bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
Though he'd be a poorer man if he never saw eagles fly
Rocky Mountain high

The Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high (high  high)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)

It's the tenth of January and I still ain't had no sleep
She comes waltzing in the nighttime, made of wings
She is dressed up like a bandit with a hundred sparkling rings
Looking for my company to keep
Coming closer to me, she doesn't say a word
In the shadow of the carved rock tower
Where the sounds of the night were the only things we heard
In my darkest hour

She don't want to hear no secrets, she would guarantee me that
She knows there ain't no words that can describe her
With her white silk scarves and her black Spanish hat
She knows there ain't no way I can deny her
Yes, her blue velvet perfume, filling up the night
The guards are all asleep that watch the tower
The moonlight held her breast as she easily undressed
In my darkest hour

Her father's in his chambers with his friends all gathered 'round
They are plotting their enemy's demise
With their last detail done, they await the coming sun
While I am staring in my lover's eyes
Her brothers and her sisters are all through for tonight
Pretending that they've just come to power
But she, far most of all, knows that they can only fall
In my darkest hour

Hungry wings, their melodies, while my love awakens me
In the midst of the sunburst first light
And her hands are holding up the skies as I hid my opened eyes
Every move just for herself, and that's so right
Soon I went along my way with no words that could explain
As she began descending to the tower
Her safety now concerns me, her circumstance to blame
In my darkest hour

And you are type strange megalomaniacal
Monster in the game and I got my eye on you
Dead shot aim as free throws keep coming
Down like rain, you feeling me, I'm feeling you
The Monstar again, I'm telling you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do, my tactics
Is unsportsmanlike conduct, you better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift?
You get stripped by Ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer
Danger you're dealing with official hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk

Uh, lightning strikes and the court lights get dim

Above the Rim, finessing and moves is animated
Once I get to balling, I can't be deflated

When clicks get to bugging, I'm snatching up their bunnies
Uh, every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shake you down
This is my planet, I'm 'bout business

669,Atlantis,Try For The Sun: The Journey Of Donovan,Donovan,2005-09-13,308960,0,"

{Introductory Monologue}
The continent of Atlantis was an island
Which lay before the great flood
In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean
So great an area of land
That from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed
To the South and the North Americas with ease
In their ships with painted sails
To the East Africa was her neighbor
Across a short strait of sea miles

The great Egyptian age is but a remnant of the Atlantean culture
The antediluvian kings colonised the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends from all lands were from fair Atlantis

Knowing her fate
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth
On board were the Twelve
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician
And the other so-called Gods of our legends
Though Gods they were
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice and let us sing
And dance and ring in the new
Hail Atlantis!

{Chorus}
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be
Way down below the ocean, where I wanna be, she may be

[Outro]
My antediluvian baby, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I wanna see you someday
My antediluvian baby, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
My antediluvian baby
My antediluvian baby, I love you, girl
Girl, I wanna see you someday
My antediluvian baby, oh yeah
I wanna see you someday, oh my antediluvian baby
My antediluvian baby, I wanna see you
My antediluvian baby, gotta tell me where she gone
I wanna see you someday
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Is trying hard to learn this song
They serenade the weekend squire
Who just came out to mow his lawn

Charcoal burning everywhere
Rows of houses that are all the same
And no one seems to care

See Mrs. Gray she's proud today
Because her roses are in bloom
And Mr. Green he's so serene
He's got a TV in every room

Here in status symbol land
Mothers complain about how hard life is
And the kids just don't understand

To places far away
I need a change of scenery

Rooster hits the washboard and people just got to smile
Blinky thumps the gut bass and solos for a while
Poor Boy twangs the rhythm out, on his Kalamazoo

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 1]
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
I promise to go under it

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 3]
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 4]
And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

678,Shelter from the Storm,Blood On The Tracks,Bob Dylan,1975-01-17,301133,60,"

[Verse 1]
'Twas in another lifetime
One of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
The road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness
A creature void of form
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 2]
And if I pass this way again
You can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her
On that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men
Who are fighting to be warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 3]
Not a word was spoke between us
There was little risk involved
Everything up to that point
Had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place
Where it's always safe and warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 4]
I was burned out from exhaustion
Buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes
And blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile
Ravaged in the corn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 5]
Suddenly I turned around
And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
And flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
And took my crown of thorns
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 6]
Now there's a wall between us
Something there's been lost
I took too much for granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began
On an uneventful morn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 7]
Well the deputy walks on hard nails
And the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much
It's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker
He blows a futile horn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm

[Verse 8]
I've heard newborn babies wailing
Like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth
Stranded without love
Do I understand your question, then
Is it hopeless and forlorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 9]
In a little hilltop village
They gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
And she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence
And I got repaid with scorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

[Verse 10]
Well, I'm living in a foreign country
But I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge
Someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock
To when God and her were born
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

Oh, the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins
The hour that the ship comes in

And the sea will split
And the ships will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the waves will pound
And the mornin' will be a-breakin'

The fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls, they'll be smilin'
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh, the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And they'll know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in

And they'll raise their hands
Sayin', ""We'll meet all your demands""
But we'll shout from the bow, ""Your days are numbered""
And like Pharoah's tribe
They'll be drowned in the tide
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered

Eight miles high, and when you touch down
You'll find that it's stranger than known
Signs in the street, that say where you're going
Are somewhere just being their own

Nowhere is there warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Rain gray town, known for its sound
In places, small faces unbound

Round the squares, huddled in storms
Some laughing, some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes, and black limousines
Some living, some standing alone

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning, I'll come followin' you

Take me for a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
All my senses have been stripped
And my hands can't feel to grip
And my toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'

I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Unto my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm goin' to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you

[Verse 1]
The reasons why, oh, I can't say
I have to let you go, babe, and right away
After what you did, I can't stay on

[Chorus]
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone

[Verse 2]
Baby, for a long time, you had me believe
That your love was all mine, and that's the way it would be
But I didn't know, that you were putting me on

[Chorus]
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Oh, when you're gone

[Verse 3]
Now I've got to say that it's not like before
And I'm not gonna play your games anymore
After what you did, I can't stay on

[Chorus]
And I'll probably feel a whole lot better
When you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone
Oh, when you're gone

688,American Pie,The Best Of Don McLean,Don McLean,1988-01-01,515866,68,"

[Intro]
A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

[Chorus]
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 1]
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock 'n roll
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

[Chorus]
I started singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 2]
Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

[Chorus]
We were singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 3]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

[Chorus]
We started singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 4]
Oh, and there we were, all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

[Chorus]
We were singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die...""

[Breakdown]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The father, son, and the holy ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

[Deleted Verse]
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

[Chorus]
And they were singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

[Outro]
They were singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die...""

Little boxes on the hillside
Little boxes made of ticky tacky
Little boxes
Little boxes
Little boxes all the same
There's a green one and a pink one
And a blue one and a yellow one
And they're all made out of ticky tacky
And they all look just the same

And the people in the houses all went to the university
And they all get put in boxes, little boxes all the same
And there's doctors and there's lawyers
And business executives
And they all get put in boxes, and they all come out the same
And they all play on the golf course and drink their martini dry
And they all have pretty children and the children go to school
And the children go to summer camp
And then to the university
And they all get put in boxes, and they all come out the same
And the boys go into business and marry and raise a family
And they all get put in boxes, little boxes all the same

There's a green one, and a pink one
And a blue one and a yellow one
And they're all made out of ticky tacky
And they all look just the same

What did you learn in school today
Dear little boy of mine?
What did you learn in school today
Dear little boy of mine?

I learned that Washington never told a lie
I learned that soldiers seldom die
I learned that everybody's free
And that's what the teacher said to me

What did you learn in school today
Dear little boy of mine?
What did you learn in school today

I learned that justice never ends
I learned that murderers die for their crimes
Even if we make a mistake sometimes

What did you learn in school today
Dear little boy of mine?
What did you learn in school today
Dear little boy of mine?

I learned our Government must be strong;
It's always right and never wrong;
Our leaders are the finest men
And we elect them again and again

What did you learn in school today
Dear little boy of mine?
What did you learn in school today
Dear little boy of mine?

I learned that war is not so bad;
I learned about the great ones we have had;
We fought in Germany and in France
And someday I might get my chance
And that's what I learned in school today

That's what I learned in school today
That's what I learned in school

I'll write you a letter from time to time
While I ramble you can travel with me, too

It's fare thee well my own true love
We'll meet another day, another time

I'll write you of troubles and of laughter
Be them somebody else's or my own
With my hands in my pocket, and my coat collar high
I will travel unnoticed and unknown

It's fare thee well my own true love
We'll meet another day, another time

694,I Ain't Marching Anymore,I Ain't Marching Anymore,Phil Ochs,1965,154893,37,"

[Verse 1]
Oh, I marched to the Battle of New Orleans
At the end of the early British wars
A young land started growing
The young blood started flowing
But I ain't marching anymore

[Verse 2]
For I've killed my share of Injuns
In a thousand different fights
I was there at the Little Big Horn
I heard many men a-lying, I saw many more a-dying
But I ain't marching anymore

[Bridge]
It's always the old to lead us to the wars
Always the young to fall
Now look at all we've won with the saber and the gun
Tell me is it worth it all?

[Verse 3]
For I stole California from the Mexican land
Fought in the bloody Civil War
Yes, I even killed my brothers
And so many others
But I ain't marching anymore

[Verse 4]
For I marched to the battles of the German trench
In a war that was bound to end all wars
Oh, I must have killed a million men
And now they want me back again
But I ain't marching anymore

[Bridge]
It's always the old to lead us to the wars
Always the young to fall
Now look at all we've won with the saber and the gun
Tell me is it worth it all?

[Verse 5]
For I flew the final mission in the Japanese skies
Set off the mighty mushroom roar
When I saw the cities burning I knew that I was learning
That I ain't marching anymore

[Verse 6]
Now the labor leader's screamin'
When they close the missile plants
United Fruit screams at the Cuban shore
Call it peace or call it treason
Call it love or call it reason
But I ain't marching anymore
No, I ain't marching anymore

Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no names
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

[Chorus]
Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

[Chorus]
Nighttime on The City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his song again
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Now you've decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or off stage lights
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I know I've dreamed you, a sin and a lie
I had my freedom but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day

Oh don't you cry for me
For I come from Alabama
With my banjo on my knee

I had a dream the other night
When everything was still
I thought I saw Susanna
A-coming down the hill

The buckwheat cake
Was in her mouth
The tear was
In her eye
Says I, I'm coming from the south
Susanna, don't you cry

Oh, Susanna
Oh don't you cry for me

701,The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,The Times They Are A-Changin',Bob Dylan,1964-01-13,345133,37,"

William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gatherin'
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was a-snarling
And in a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn’t even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothin' to William Zanzinger
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now’s the time for your tears

702,With God on Our Side,The Times They Are A-Changin',Bob Dylan,1964-01-13,424413,38,"

Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I’s taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side

Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Ah the country was young
With God on its side

The Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I’s made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side

The First World War boys
It came and it went
The reason for fightin'
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don’t count the dead
When God’s on your side

The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side

I’ve learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It’s them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side

But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them we’re forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And ya' never ask questions
When God’s on your side

Through many dark hour
I been thinking about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can’t think for ya'
You’ll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side

So now as I’m leavin'
I’m weary as Hell
The confusion I’m feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And they fall to the floor
If God’s on our side
He’ll stop the next war

[Verse 1]
Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night, and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence""

[Intro]
Someone told me
It's all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe it's true

[Verse 1]
It's a light and tumble journey
From the East Side to the park;
Just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo
But you can take the crosstown bus
If it's raining or it's cold
And the animals will love it
If you do
If you do now

[Bridge]
Something tells me
It's all happening at the zoo
I do believe it
I do believe it's true

[Verse 2]
The monkeys stand for honesty
Giraffes are insincere
And the elephants are kindly but they're dumb
Orangutans are skeptical
Of changes in their cages
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum
Zebras are reactionaries
Antelopes are missionaries
Pigeons plot in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently
What a gas! You gotta come and see
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo
At the zoo

What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline
Of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets down
Past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on
And when you ran to me, your
Cheeks flashed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand
And when I awoke
And felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair
With my grateful tears
Oh, I love you girl
Oh, how I love you!

[Verse 1]
A winter’s day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen, silent shroud of snow

[Refrain]
I am a rock
I am an island

[Verse 2]
I’ve built walls
A fortress, steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain
It’s laughter and it’s loving I disdain

[Refrain]
I am a rock
I am an island

[Verse 3]
Don’t talk of love
Well, I’ve heard the word before
It’s sleeping in my memory
I won’t disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I never loved, I never would have cried

[Refrain]
I am a rock
I am an island

[Verse 4]
I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me

[Refrain]
I am a rock
I am an island

[Outro]
And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries

[Verse 1]
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

[Verse 2]
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
On the side of a hill, in the deep forest green
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground
Without no seams nor needle work
Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Sleeps unaware of the clarion call

[Verse 3]
Tell her to find me an acre of land
On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Washes the grave with silvery tears
Between the salt water and the sea strands
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun
Then she'll be a true love of mine

[Verse 4]
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Generals order their soldiers to kill
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten
Then she'll be a true love of mine

[Verse 5]
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind

[Verse 1]
Behold, Jehovah's prophets in the wilderness
Unfold the scroll, the contents of my syllabus
Everybody want the fast life, but fast life equals fast death
Where do you go after your last breath?
That's the question that we stressing
Expressions of reverence for your blessing
So check the lesson in the message
The message in the lesson will break the chains of addiction
The strains of affliction
Shackles of oppression
Our country go to war for money while the poor and hungry live in tabernacles of depression
Now we're here to expose the prince of the power of the air
Because the final hour it is near
And Satan might creep, so awake my peeps
From your late night sleep, gone astray like sheep
Don't wait too late and say ""I wish I knew then what I know now""
All I'm saying is ""slow down""

[Hook]
Slow down
You gotta slow down
Slow down
You gotta slow down

[Verse 2]
The radio refuse to play stuff like this
'Cause they're shady, so, they choose the unrighteous
They want your minds- vain guys long for power
Labels pay 'em to play the same five songs an hour
A lot ain't even hot: in fact
I heard the same song so many times, I almost forgot it was wack
When the same message is pumped repeatedly
Maybe not immediately; But sooner or later, the seed will be a tree
You're crazy if you think it don't affect the minds of the kids
When their favorite rapper be flossin' the diamonds and cribs
In their rhyming is fibs about grabbing techs to blast ya
But he's a slave: a record exec his master
One out of every four black males have been arrested
One out of every three females have been molested
You don't see the connection, you living on the surface
Why would you choose to be ignorant on purpose?
The light in this world is really dim
When 9 year old girls wanna grow up to be like Lil' Kim
14, eyes on the guy with the Range Rover
He ain't sober, she still believed the things he told her
Now he got a new lady, so for him it may be over
But for her it's just beginning, she's pushing a baby stroller
Saying,""I wish I knew then what I know now""
Somebody should have told her ""slow down""

[Hook]
Slow down
You gotta slow down
Slow down
You gotta slow down

[Verse 3]
As long as me and DJ Essence record new joints
Best believe, son, you're gonna get the Lord's viewpoint
Most won't feel it due to hardness of the heart
For light has come into the world but men love the dark
You don't have to show a child how to be disobedient
They already know how, they're wired to be deviant
What do you say about someone who dwells with fools?
And when did it become a bad thing to do well in school?
I guess because you failed you cool? That's absurdity
That's why you're allergic to what I fervently kick verbally
You know your mindstate is secular
When your eyes are dry while a sky high crime rate is regular
Extortion, pride, weed, abortion, lies, greed
Whores that got fees- the Lord is not pleased
Think about it logically
If God doesn't judge America, He owes Sodom and Gomorrah an apology
That's why Christ came to take the wrath and the pain
Laughs and the shame, on our behalf He was slain
Trust He's resurrected 'cause the sacrifice went well
And forever you'll be glad where the righteous dwell
Imagine spending half of your life in a cell
And die just to spend your afterlife in hell
Saying, ""I wish I knew then what I know now""
The whole time God was saying ""slow down""

[Hook]
Slow down
You gotta slow down
Slow down
You gotta slow down

[Bridge]
As the world goes around
People drown
In the evil that abounds
It's deep and profound
Media trying to drown out the sound
Of the Lord saying, ""Boys and girls- slow down""

[Hook]
Slow down
You gotta slow down
Slow down
You gotta slow down

711,A Horse with No Name,America,America,1972,252239,76,"

[Verse 1]
On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

[Chorus]
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

[Verse 2]
After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

[Chorus]
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

[Chorus]
You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

[Verse 1]
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In a castle dark, or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me

[Chorus 1]
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

[Verse 2]
If I could read your mind love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind that drugstores sell

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you reach the part, where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail

[Chorus 2]
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I'd walk away, like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two

A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me

But for now love, let's be real

[Bridge 1]
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone, and I just can't get it back

[Verse 1]
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well

[Pre-Chorus 4]
In a castle dark, or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end

[Chorus 4]
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand

[Post-Chorus 4]
The feelin's that you lack

[Bridge 2]
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone
And I just can't get it back

713,The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,Rhino Hi-Five: Gordon Lightfoot,Gordon Lightfoot,2005-06-21,388800,34,"

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy

With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the ""Gales of November"" came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And ev'ry man knew, as the captain did too
'twas the ""Witch of November"" come stealin'

The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the Gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough t'feed ya""
At seven P.M. a main hatchway caved in; he said
""Fellas, it's bin good t'know ya!""

The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind 'er

They might have split up or they might have capsized;
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams;
The islands and bays are for sportsmen

And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the Gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the ""Maritime Sailors' Cathedral""
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call Gitche Gumee
""Superior,"" they said, ""never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early!""

About having to be scrounging your next meal

On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe

At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal

Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air

So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

But when I see you hanging about with anyone

No matter what you say

You find it happens all the time
Love will never do, what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine?

Feed one child and starve another
Tell me, tell me legislator

Now how do you make your bread in the ghetto
How do you make your bread in the ghetto
Baked from the souls of the dead in the ghetto

As long as nobody tries to close the doors
They cry with pain when the knife cuts deep
They close their eyes when they wanna sleep

We must all have identity (Whoo)
That's the only way that we can be free
Now peace you say
Is all that you ask
But self-respect is our separate task

In your ivory tower

Now you may have seen one ghetto
But have you lived there at all

Places like Watts (tell me)
Detroit (tell me)
Filmore (tell me)

Sing our voices (tell me)

You talk like Marlene Dietrich
And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire
Your clothes are all made by Balmain
And there's diamonds and pearls in your hair, yes there are

You live in a fancy apartment
Off the Boulevard St. Michel
Where you keep your Rolling Stones records
And a friend of Sacha Distel, yes you do

You go to the embassy parties
Where you talk in Russian and Greek
And the young men who move in your circles
They hang on every word you speak, yes they do

But where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

I've seen all your qualifications
You got from the Sorbonne
And the painting you stole from Picasso
Your loveliness goes on and on, yes it does

When you go on your summer vacation
You go to Juan-les-Pins
With your carefully designed topless swimsuit
You get an even suntan on your back, and on your legs

And when the snow falls you're found in St. Moritz
With the others of the jet set
And you sip your Napoleon brandy
But you never get your lips wet, no you don't

But where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Won't you tell me the thoughts that surround you?
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

You're in between twenty and thirty
That's a very desirable age
Your body is firm and inviting
But you live on a glittering stage, yes you do, yes you do

Your name is heard in high places
You know the Aga Khan
He sent you a race horse for Christmas
And you keep it just for fun, for a laugh, ha-ha-ha

They say that when you get married
It'll be to a millionaire
But they don't realize where you came from
And I wonder if they really care, or give a damn

But where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

I remember the back streets of Naples:
Two children begging in rags
Both touched with a burning ambition
To shake off their lowly-born tags, they tried

So look into my face, Marie-Claire
And remember just who you are
Then go and forget me forever
But I know you still bear the scar, deep inside

I know where you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
I know the thoughts that surround you
Cause I can look inside your head

I feel so bad I've got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou

Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working 'till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou
I'm going back some day
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where you sleep all day
And the catfish play on Blue Bayou

All those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Go to see my baby again
And to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then on Blue Bayou

I'm going back some day
Gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Oh, that girl of mine by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day gonna take away
This hurtin' inside
I'll never be blue
My dreams come true on Blue Bayou

Forgive, forget. Where's the love we once knew?

Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my, everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl to be my bride

Be a lasting part of everlasting love

Where life's river flows, no one really knows
Till someone's there to show the way to lasting love
Like the sun shines, endlessly it shines

When other's love-light's gone, ours will be strong
We'll have our very own, everlasting love

Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please
But look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hear the salvation army band
Down by the riverside's,
Bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand
And look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

[Verse 3]
Hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hope should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again
Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

[Verse 4]
Ahhh, seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
While looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my vodka and lime
I look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground...
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground...
Look around

Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in
And then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah

Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And look like nothin's gonna come my way

Everything still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes

Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home

Watching the tide roll away
Oooo-wee, sittin' on the dock of the bay

As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

[Verse 2]
People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

[Verse 3]
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

[Verse 4]
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

[Verse 5]
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, He steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

[Bridge]
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

And as her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto

And his mama cries

The only shirt I own is hanging on my back
But I'm the envy of every single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style
But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true

In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I, I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can't buy
But I'll never, never make my baby cry

Somebody that needs me
For once in my life

[Verse 1]
When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know, downtown

[Pre-Chorus]
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

[Chorus]
So go downtown
Things will be great when you're downtown
No finer place for sure, downtown
Everything's waiting for you

[Verse 2]
Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close downtown

[Pre-Chorus]
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over
Happy again
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

[Chorus]
So go downtown
Where all the lights are bright, downtown
Waiting for you tonight, downtown
You're gonna be alright now, downtown

[Instrumental Break w/ Backing Vocals]
Downtown
Downtown

[Pre-Chorus]
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares

[Chorus]
So go downtown
Things will be great when you're downtown
Don't wait a minute more, downtown
Everything is waiting for you, downtown

[Outro]
Downtown (downtown)
Downtown (downtown)
Downtown (downtown)
Downtown (downtown)

[Verse 1]
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse 2]
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
'Fore it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse 3]
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

778,What the World Needs Now (Is Love),Here Where There Is Love,Dionne Warwick,1967,191000,53,"

[Damon Warwick]
Yo mom, who thought that this could happen

[Dionne]
Nobody but me

[Ray J]
Love is what we need
So if you get that, the blessing will proceed, so please give back

[Big Daddy Kane]
Coming at ya, mob deep on this song
And now it's on
Come together for born
Better yet form Voltron
Spread love like mustard, bust it, making knowledge be born
So trust it, it's B-D-K, learn to love it

[Dionne Warwick](Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love

[Flesh Bone]
I know just exactly what world needs now, plead it
Everybody come show a little love for your family, Jesus we need it   And
Even when I flip through the pages of my history
Slowly reveal the mystery
Got to get it together quickly, in this industry

[Dionne Warwick]
Lord, we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last till the end of time

[Kurupt]
Yo, yo, yo
I could see far and beyond, me and my auntie Dionne
With the homie Fazon, who's cool as freon
As the music plays on, portrays and stays on
Got this thing together, got to get our game together
Life is life and if your ears are open
You could see when you scope doors closed or open
Whether you're in or you're out
You're always in and that's for sure
And that's what friends are for, for what the world needs

[Dionne Warwick] (Chorus)
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now

[Dionne Warwick]
Lord, we don't need another meadow
There are cornfields and wheat fields enough to grow
There are sunbeams and monnbeams enough to shine
Listen Lord, if you want to know

[Mic G]
Give me this drug, they call it love
I'd pump it off around the world
To touch the soul of every man, woman, child, boy and girl

[Royal Flush]
I pray that we could live together on this family tree
Royal Flush and Mic G, we want the world to see

[Big Daddy Kane]
What's happening
Is the matter when the people traveling
To grasp a pen and pad and then this united gathering
Keep it on the love, love if you expect the vibe
Work it out just like an exercise, shame of

[Dionne Warwick] (Chorus)
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
What the world needs no
Come on can we have unity
Just a little bit of unity, brother
Just a little bit, just a little bit of love baby

[Coolio]
L is for the lies that they told and the lines that they crossed
When they burglarized my soul, they cold
O is for the outsiders looking in, times is looking grim
You can't even trust your friends, damn
V, cause it's very necessary
That various policies get variated and eradicated, I hate it
E is for the extra mile you had to walk
Just to talk to your homie who was locing
And to show him you have love for him

[Dionne Warwick]
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now
It's the only thing that there's just too little of

[Flesh Bone]
We humbly gather together united with almighty power
Ready to rumble at any hour
Got love and it won't let me stumble, follow me

[Dionne Warwick]
What the world needs now is love sweet love
What the world needs now

[Tyrese] (Fades out)
Can we get together, I'm on my way, baby
Come on get together, unity
We can unify the hip-hop nation

I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

[Chorus]
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Don't ever leave me

[Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are searchers of the truth
Every man's a boy deep down
Gotta say it how you mean it
There ain't no easy way

Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born
'Til the very last day when the curtains are drawn

Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Asking every question why
From arrival to survival
Just to make it worth the waiting
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are faces in the night
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
There ain't no easy way

[Verse 2]
In the back of your mind, there is always a mark
There's a wandering soul all alone in the dark
You can keep it forever or tear it apart

Watching every day go by
Changing my life, changing your life
Keeps us all anticipating

Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating

Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating

We choose it..win or lose it
Love is never quite the same
I love you..now Ive lost you
Dont feel bad..your not too late

So kiss me goodbye
And I'll try not to cry
All the tears in the world won't change your mind
Theres some1 new
And shes waiting for you
Soon your heart will be leving me behind

Linger awhile...then I'll go with a smile
Like a friend who just happened to call
For the last time..pretend you are mine
My darling...kiss me goodbye

My darling..kiss me goodbye

[Chorus]
To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven

[Verse 1]
A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal
A time to laugh, a time to weep

To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven

A time to build up, a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones
A time to gather stones together

To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)
And a time to every purpose, under Heaven

[Verse 3]
A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace
A time to refrain from embracing

To Everything (Turn, Turn, Turn)
There is a season (Turn, Turn, Turn)

A time to rend, a time to sew
A time for love, a time for hate
A time for peace, I swear it's not too late

[Verse 1]
One pill makes you larger
And one pill makes you small
And the ones that mother gives you
Don't do anything at all
Go ask Alice
When she's ten feet tall

[Verse 2]
And if you go chasing rabbits
And you know you're going to fall
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar
Has given you the call
Call Alice
When she was just small

[Verse 3]
When the men on the chessboard
Get up and tell you where to go
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
And your mind is moving low
Go ask Alice
I think she'll know

[Verse 4]
When logic and proportion
Have fallen sloppy dead
And the White Knight is talking backwards
And the Red Queen's off with her head
Remember what the Dormouse said
Feed your head
Feed your head
