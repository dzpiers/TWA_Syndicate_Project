[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

1,Last Resort,Infest,Papa Roach,2001-04-25,199906,79,"

[Intro]
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort

[Verse 1]
Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort – suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arms bleeding
Do you even care, if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplatin' suicide

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

[Verse 2]
I never realized I was spread too thin
'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself and no love for another
Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
Findin' nothin' but questions and devils

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

[Bridge]
Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm runnin' and I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
I can't go on living this way

[Verse 3]
Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

[Outro]
Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm runnin' and I'm crying
I can't go on living this way
Can't go on living this way
Nothing's alright

[Verse 1]
Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

[Verse 2]
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

[Verse 3]
You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets, I will keep
You took for granted all the times, I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

[Chorus]
If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might

If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might

[Verse 1]
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted (woah oh, woah oh, oh)
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud

[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks

[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive

Desperate for changing
Starving for truth
I'm closer to where I started

I'm falling even more in love with you
Letting go of all I've held onto

Completely incomplete
I'll take your invitation
You take all of me now

And I don't know what I'm diving into
Just hanging by a moment here with you

Hanging by a moment (Here with you)
Hanging by a moment here with you

5,Beautiful Day,All That You Can't Leave Behind,U2,2000-01-01,248400,72,"

[Verse 1]
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stoney ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

[Verse 2]
You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

[Post-Chorus]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Bridge]
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

[Post-Chorus]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Outro]
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day

""Mr. Durst?""
""Yeah?""
""We need your help. Pulling into the diner about now should be four top-secret agents. One of them is carrying a briefcase. Your mission is to obtain the disc from the briefcase.""

[Verse 1]
All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should (Like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it
Ya shit can how we did it, just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
But do we always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid? So what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when you're starin' down the cable of a
Mic pointed at your grill like a gun?
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette, when you're placin', you bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done
'Cause I'ma be the one till I jet (I'ma be the one till I jet)

I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

[Verse 2: Fred Durst]
Does anybody really know the secret?
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason (Everything happens for a reason)
I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot, a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fists
And everybody wanna run (Wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (Hide from the gun)
You can take that ride through this life, if you want
But you can't take the edge off the knife (No, sir!)
And now you want your money back (Your money back)
But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sack
And there ain't nothin' I can do
'Cause life is a lesson, you learn it when you're through

[Chorus 1]
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me (Wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

[Refrain]
And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!
And now you wanna hate me!
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately!

(Shhhhhh...)
Now I know why
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why (I know why you wanna hate me)

Now I know why you wanna hate me!
Now I know why you wanna hate me!
Now I know why you wanna hate me!

There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my obsession

[Verse 1]
I just want to be heard
Loud and clear are my words
Coming from within man
Tell them what you heard
It's about a revolution
In your heart and in your mind
You can find the conclusion
Lifestyle and obsession
Diamond rings get you nothin'
But a lifelong lesson
And your pocketbook stressin'
You're a slave to the system
Working jobs that you hate
For that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed
Step back and see
Stop thinking about yourself
Start thinking about

There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit

[Verse 2]
Because everything is nothing, and emptiness is in everything
This reality is really just a fucked up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
Flip it inside out It's a big black hole
Take your money burn it up like an asteroid
Possessions, they are never going to fill the void
Take it away and learn the best lesson
The heart, the soul, the life, the passion

There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession

Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit

Fuck your money, fuck your possessions, fuck your obsession

So take your lies, get off my case
Someday I will find
A love that flows through me like this
This will fall away

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
We're the renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades

[Verse 1]
Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages
Planet Earth kept going through changes
And then no renaissance came (Came)
And times continued to change (Change)
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades!

[Chorus]
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk

[Verse 2]
From a different solar system
Many, many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission, to help the others listen
And groove from land to land, singin' electronic chants like
Zulu Nation

[Bridge]
Revelations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations

[Verse 3]
Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies

We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble, the horns, and our vocals
'Cause every time I pop into the beat, we get fresh

[*drum break*]

Come on

[Guitar solo]

Come on

[Verse 5]
There was a time when our music
Was something called ""The Bay Street"" beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a renegade in those days
To take a man to the dance floor

[Verse 1]
Watch your back because the next man is coming
And you don't know if the next man is dumbin'
Survival of the fittest what it is
I got your back, you got my back and that's the biz
Blood is rushing through my veins, I got the power
Channel the energy and with my strength I will devour
Sickening thoughts is running through my head
That's when I realize I'm glad I'm not dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Corruption and abuse
The salesman of our blood
For the public's craving
Existence in the dark

[Chorus]
It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill, kill, kill

[Verse 2]
It was a dream and then it hit me, reality struck
And now my life is all shifty and it all moves fast
Close to a buck fifty; we all stand strong
In respect to the family in times of insanity
And through words of profanity
I describe our dysfunctional family
Blood brothers keep it real to the end
Deeper than the thoughts you think, not a trend

Corruption and abuse
The salesman of our blood
For the public's craving
Existence in the dark

It's in our nature to kill, kill, kill

Again and again

Corruption and abuse

For the public is craving
Existence in the dark

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves

[Intro]
You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'Til one by one they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, something's out there
Floating in the summer sky
Ninety-nine red balloons go by

[Verse 1]
Ninety-nine red balloons
Floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
As ninety-nine red balloons go by

[Verse 2]
Ninety-nine decisions treat
Ninety-nine ministers meet
To worry, worry, super scurry
Call out the troops now in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it, boys, this is war
The President is on the line
As ninety-nine red balloons go by

[Bridge]
Neunundneunzig Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich füare schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen: Krieg und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht?
Daß es einmal so weit kommt
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
Neunundneunzig Luftballons

[Outro]
Ninety-nine dreams I have had
And every one a red balloon
It's all over, and I'm standing pretty
In the dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenir
Just to prove the world was here
Here it is, a red balloon
I think of you and let it go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming) Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling) Confusing what is real

Absentminded thoughts, now you're a stranger

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall

So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin (I feel the light betray me)

Tell us where you’re from
What you want to become
And we’ll say if you’re okay
Where did you go to school?
Right answer and you’re cool
Yeah, you’re the kid the whole day

You get a sticker in your face
Information about the case
So you know your potential
Don’t think you can extend
Don’t think you can extend
Just comprehend

But I don’t wanna hear it
No, it’s more than I accept

’Cause I don’t care where I belong no more
What we share or not I will ignore
I will ignore

We will shut you out
We’ll put you in doubt
If you think that you’re special
We’ll tell you who you are
We’ll tell you that you’re close
But no cigar

But I don’t wanna hear it
No, it’s more than I accept

’Cause I don’t care where I belong no more
What we share or not I will ignore
And I won’t waste my time fitting in
’Cause I don’t think contrast is a sin
What they say is

Go back, where you came from
They’ll tell you that, I don’t wanna hear
No, I don’t wanna hear

The passing of everyday human events
And isolation is the oxygen mask

Shining with the light from the sun

You do favors, then rapidly
Just turn around and start askin' me about
Things that you want back from me

Sick of you actin' like I owe you this

Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew

How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

[Verse 2]
I've been doin' all the dumb shit, yo, because nothin' is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around, I got ya humming
Hummin', comin' at ya
Then you know I had to gat ya
Time for some action, just a fraction of friction (Uh)
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shining a battle light
Swing out the gat, and I know that we'll gat you right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, ""Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're assed out
How do you like my chrome?"" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did any way
Ha ha ha ha ha! Young punk had to pay
So I just killed the man

[Chorus 1]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

[Bridge]
It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite you with these site
So if you ain't down
Bullshit

[Verse 3]
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would call the one time and play the role model?
No, I think you'll play like a thug
Next, hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming, coming at ya!
Yeah, you know I'm gonna to gat ya
How do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, yo, I gotta say, ""Fuck it""

[Refrain]
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

How I could just kill a man
How I could just kill a man

[Intro]
Welcome to the original Papa Roach soundfire
Viva la Cucaracha!

[Verse 1]
My name's Coby Dick
Mr. Dick if you're nasty
Rock a mic with a voice that's raspy
And I'm poetic in my operations
My God given talent is to rock all the nations

[Bridge]
We're going to infest

[Verse 2]
Infest, the theory of my first manifesto
Push your wig back with my lyrical pistol
Blow, now Papa Roach is on your mental
Banging like your headpiece, it's just that simple
Cock back and unleash with my physical
Wrap you in my thoughts and become indivisible
Centrifugal forces, individuals
Stick to my mind as we rock into ritual

[Pre-Chorus]
You better do just what I say
And if you don't then you will pay
Infest!

[Chorus]
We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government, the media or your family

We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government, the media or your family

[Post-Chorus]
You bettter do just what I say

[Verse 3]
Now that I got your attention
Did I forget to mention
All the heads we be infesting
Hope you people learn your lessons
'Cause the game of life is crazy
Got all y'all people guessing
What is wrong with the world today?
Government, media, or your family
Would you cry if I died today?
I think it'd be better if you did not say

[Pre-Chorus]
You better do just what I say
And if you don't then you will pay
Infest!

[Chorus]
We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government, the media or your family

We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government, the media or your family

[Bridge]
We will infest, die like the rest

First they shackle your feet
Then they stand you in a line
Then they beat you like meat
Then they grab you by your mind
First they shackle your feet
Then they stand you in a line
Then they beat you like meat
Infest your mind

We will infest, die like the rest
People are the problem today
We will infest, die like the rest
People are the problem today

[Chorus]
We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government, the media or your family

Starry nights, city lights coming down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers in my head
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams
Lost and found, city-bound in my dreams

And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting
And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting

Forget me nots, second thoughts live in isolation
Heads or tails, fairytales in my mind
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
The rage and love, the story of my life
The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie

And screaming
Are we we are, are we we are the waiting

Run desire, run, sexual being
Run him like a blade to and through the heart
No conscience, one motive
To cater to the hollow

Screaming feed me, here
Fill me up again

So grow, libido, throw
Dominoes of indiscretions down
Falling all around in cycles, in circles
Constantly consuming, conquer and devour

'Cause it's time to bring the fire down
Bridle all this indiscretion
Long enough to edify
And permanently fill this hollow

Screaming feed me, here
Fill me up again

Feed me, here
Fill me up again

""Hey, ain't life wonderful? Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful... Isn't it wonderful now?""

[Verse 1: Art]
I close my eyes when I get too sad
I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them

I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
Make everything be wonderful again

[Verse 2: Art]
Hope my mom and I hope my dad
Will figure out why they get so mad
Hear them scream, I hear them fight
They say bad words that make me wanna cry

Close my eyes when I go to bed
And I dream of angels who make me smile
I feel better when I hear them say
Everything will be wonderful someday

[Pre-Chorus: Art]
Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world's so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
Tell me everything is wonderful now

I go to school and I run and play
I tell the kids that it's all okay
I laugh aloud so my friends won't know
When the bell rings I just don't wanna go home

Go to my room and I close my eyes
I make believe that I have a new life
I don't believe you when you say
Everything will be wonderful someday

Ain't life a bitch? A fucked up bitch
A fucked up sore with a fucked up stitch
A fucked up head, it's a fucked up shame
Swingin' on my nuts is a fucked up game

45,Absolutely (Story of a Girl) - Radio Mix,The Madding Crowd,Nine Days,2000-05-16,189333,66,"

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises, never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror, so how do you choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles

Now how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this shit day after day?
How did we wind up this way?
Watching our mouths for the words that we say
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose
How do we get there today?
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her when she smiles

Well, your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
Her pretty face, she hid from the world
And while she looked so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looked so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she smiles
When she smiles

And you don't see me

[Verse 2]
But I threw you the obvious
Just to see if there's more behind
The eyes of a fallen angel
Eyes of a tragedy

[Pre-Chorus]
Here, I am, expecting just a little bit
Too much from the wounded
But I see, see through it all
See through, see you

[Chorus]
'Cause I threw you the obvious
To see what occurs behind
The eyes of a fallen angel
Eyes of a tragedy, oh well

[Bridge]
Oh well, apparently nothing
Apparently nothing, at all

You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me

You don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me, at all

[Intro]
(Life in the fast lane)
This is dedicated to you Ben Stiller
You are my favorite motherfucker!
I told you, didn't I?

[Verse 1]
Drama makes the world go around
Does anybody got a problem with that? (Yeah)
My business is my business
Who's guilty? Can I get a witness?
First things first
The Chocolate Starfish is my man Fred Durst
Access Hollywood, license to kill
A redneck fucker from Jacksonville
Bangin' on the dumpster funk
My microphone machete's in the back of my trunk
Rocker's who's steady with the he says, she says
And don't forget about the starfish navigation system
Don't hate me, I'm just an alien
With thirty seven tons of new millenium
Dum-diddie-dum, where's it coming from?
Mrs. Aguilera, come and get some!
Oh no, which way to go to the dance floor?
It's on my stereo, pay me no mind
I seen The Fight Club about twenty eight times

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin'
Keep a skateboard, a spray can for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon
'Cause I don't give a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

[Chorus]
(Life in the fast lane)
I'm just a crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not giving a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane
(Life in the fast lane)
Another crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not giving a fuck in the fast lane

[Verse 2]
Take two, hoo-haa!
Now who's the star sucker? I'm the Starfish
You silly motherfucker
Puff puff, give the marijuana cig, oops
I don't even smoke, but I love the way it smells
Here's a toast to the females
Sippin' lung champagne from a seashell
I think I gotta feel and pop his ass like a zit
With the starfish navigation system
I'm no cheap thrills, baby
Fill the briefcase with three dollar bills
I'm just an ordinary run of the mill fella
Spittin' out hella' mic skills

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm 'a keep my pants saggin'
Keep a skateboard, a spray can for the taggin'
And I'm 'a keep a lot of girls in my band wagon
'Cause I don't give a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

I'm just a crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not giving a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane
(Life in the fast lane)
Another crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not giving a fuck in the fast lane

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause it's so easy to tell a lie (Life in the fast lane)
And it's so easy to run and hide (Life in the fast lane)
But it's not easy to be alive (Life in the fast lane)
So don't be wasting none on my time!

[Bridge]
This world is like a cage and I don't think it's fair
And I don't even think that anybody cares
It'll leave a hole (What?) down the side of me (What?)
And it'll leave a scar (What?), can anybody see? (What?)
That we gotta get it out (We gotta get it out)
We gotta get it out (We gotta get it out)
We gotta get it out (We gotta get it out)
And I'ma get it out with the motherfuckin'
Microphone plugging in my soul
I'm a renegade riot getting out of control
I'mma keep it alive and continue to be
Flying like an eagle to my destiny
So can you feel me? (Hell yeah!) Can you feel me? (Hell yeah!)
If you feel, motherfucker, then you'll say (Hell yeah!)
Then you'll say (Hell yeah!)
Hell yeah, I'm livin' life in the fast lane!

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause it's so easy to tell a lie (Life in the fast lane)
And it's so easy to run and hide (Life in the fast lane)
But it's not easy to be alive (Life in the fast lane)
So don't be wasting none on my time!

[Chorus]
(Yeah, bring it on!)
I'm just a crazy motherfucker livin' it up
Not giving a fuck, livin' life in the fast lane

[Chorus]
If I die before I wake
At least in Heaven I can skate
'Cause right now on Earth I can’t do jack
Without the man up on my back

[Verse 1: John E. Necro]
Now Heaven would be a DJ spinning dub all night long
And Heaven would be just kicking back with Jesus packing my bong
And if you don’t believe in Jesus; then Muhammad or Buddha too
And while the world is warring, we just sit back and laugh at you, singing…

[Chorus]
If I die before I wake
At least in Heaven I can skate
'Cause right now on earth I can’t do jack
Without the man up on my back

[Verse 2]
Now when most people think of Heaven, they see those pearly gates
But I looked a little closer and there’s a sign that says “do not skate”
So if you wanna come to my heaven where we all gonna have a ball
And everyone you know is welcome ‘cause we got no gates or walls, singing…

[Chorus]
If I die before I wake
At least in Heaven I can skate
'Cause right now on earth I can't do shit
Without the man fuckin' with it

[Verse 3]
Then I got to the gate
Pulled out a list that I’d been callin’ fate
""I’m sorry, friend, you can’t come in
You got a list here that doesn’t end""
You’re mad ‘cause I smoked dope?
You teachin’ any classes in how to cope?
I find a place to rest my head
I’d rather be alone now that I’m dead
Like Christian Hosoi way back in ‘87
We’ll be busting Christ air’s until we get to heaven
You think I really care that I missed biology?
Got my education in stale fishology
With all your rules, you gots to chill
I’m gonna twist out like Mike McGill
Gonna twist out ‘cause I got the skills
Gonna twist out ‘cause I got the skills…
Got the skills, got the skills
Got the skills, got the skills
Heaven is a halfpipe

[Chorus]
If I die before I wake
At least in Heaven I can skate
'Cause right now on earth I can't do jack
Without the man up on my back
If I die before I wake
At least in Heaven I can skate
'Cause right now on earth I can't do shit
Without the man fuckin' with it
If I die before I wake
At least in Heaven I can skate
'Cause right now on earth I can't do shit
Without the man fuckin' with it

I just can't believe, it was all a lie
No man in the moon, just a big light in the sky
I hear Disneyland
Might lose Mickey Mouse
In some giant hostile
Corporate shake up
Tell me it's a nightmare
Please wake me up
Say it isn't so
I found a book of matches
Some place we've never been
How come you hang the phone up
The minute I walk in
Last night I had this dream
That I was losing you
I woke up in a cold sweat shaking
Rescue me my heart is breaking

[Chorus 1]
Say it isn't so
(Tell me it's not true)
Say it isn't so

Tell me it's a lie

Spin around one more time
And gracefully fall back to the arms of Grace

I'm looking past the shadows of my mind into the truth
And I'm trying to identify the voices in my head
God, which one's you?
Let me feel one more time what it feels like to feel
And break these calluses off of me one more time

It is the people that made me; it is the people I wanted so much to be

[Verse 1]
Something is about to give
I can feel it coming
I think I know what it is
I'm not afraid to die
I'm not afraid to live
And when I'm flat on my back
I hope to feel like I did

And hardness, it sets in
You need some protection
The thinner the skin

I want you to know
That you don't need me anymore
I want you to know
You don't need anyone, anything at all

[Chorus]
Who's to say where the wind will take you
Who's to say what it is will break you
I don't know which way the wind will blow
Who's to know when the time has come around
Don't wanna see you cry
I know that this is not goodbye

[Verse 2]
In summer I can taste the salt in the sea
There's a kite blowing out of control on a breeze
I wonder what's gonna happen to you
You wonder what has happened to me

I'm a man, I'm not a child
A man who sees
The shadow behind your eyes

[Chorus]
Who's to say where the wind will take you
Who's to say what it is will break you
I don't know where the wind will blow
Who's to know when the time has come around
I don't wanna see you cry
I know that this is not goodbye

[Outro]
Did I waste it?
Not so much I couldn't taste it
Life should be fragrant
Roof top to the basement
The last of the rock stars
When hip hop drove the big cars
In the time when new media
Was the big idea
That was the big idea

The drinking dens are spilling out
There's staggering in the square
There's lads and lasses falling about
And a crackling in the air
Down around the dungeon doors
The shelters and the queues
Everybody's looking for
Somebody's arms to fall into

[Chorus]
That's what it is
It's what it is now

[Verse 2]
There's frost on the graves and the monuments
But the taverns are warm in town
People curse the government
And shovel hot food down
Lights are out in the city hall
The castle and the keep
The moon shines down upon it all
The legless and asleep
And it's cold on the tollgate
With the wagons creeping through
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you

[Chorus]
That's what it is
It's what it is now

[Verse 3]
The garrison sleeps in the citadel
With the ghosts and the ancient stones
High on the parapet
A Scottish piper stands alone
And high on the wind
The highland drums begin to roll
And something from the past just comes
And stares into my soul
And it's cold on the tollgate
With a Caledonian blues
Cold on the tollgate
God knows what I could do with you

That's what it is
It's what it is now
What it is

There's a lantern in the tower
Wee Willie Winkie with a candlestick
Still writing songs in the wee wee hours
On Charlotte Street I take
A walking stick for my hotel
The ghost of Dirty Dick
Is still in search of Little Nell

That's what it is
It's what it is now
It's what it is

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I can't sit back and wonder why
It took so long for this to die
And I hate it when you fake it
You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
So believe me, it's not easy
It seems that something's telling me

[Chorus]
I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
Up above in my head, instead of going under
Instead of going under

[Outro]
Instead of going under again
Instead of going under
Instead of going under again
Instead of going under again

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She was sitting at the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

Will you tell us that you're OK

That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie

It was Sunday, but a black day
I could make a salutation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

[Verse 1]
Last day of the rest of my life
I wish, I would've known 'cause I didn't kiss my mama, goodbye!
I didn't tell her that I loved her, how much I cared
Or thank my pops for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared
Unaware, I just did what I always do
Every day the same routine before I skate off to school
But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest?
Instead of takin' a test, I took two to the chest
Call me blind, but I didn't see it comin'
Everybody was runnin', but I couldn't hear nothin'
Except gun blasts, it happened so fast
I don't really know this kid, though I sit by him in class
Maybe this kid was reachin' out for love
Or maybe for a moment he forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was, I know it's because

We are, we are (we are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (we are) youth of the nation
We are, we are (we are) the youth of the nation

[Verse 2]
Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world with every chance to excel
Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud, but no respect for herself
She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations just different faces
Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her, she deserved much better
Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules, so you would think he was cool
He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried, often thought of suicide
It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end, they might remember him then
You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt with the sound of a gat

[Chorus]
We are, we are (we are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (we are) youth of the nation
We are, we are (we are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (we are) youth of the nation

[Verse 3]
Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim?
No matter what you say, it don't take away the pain
That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why, it's the blind leadin' the blind
I guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense? Somebody's got to know
There's gotta be more to life than this
There's gotta be more to everything I thought exists

[Outro]
We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation
We are, we are (we are, we are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (we are, we are) youth of the nation
We are, we are (we are, we are) the youth of the nation (youth of the nation)
We are, we are (we are, we are) youth of the nation (youth of the nation)
We are, we are (we are, we are) the youth of the nation (the youth of the nation)
We are, we are (we are, we are) youth of the nation (youth of the nation)

Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there
She's getting kicked out of school 'cause she's failing
I'm kinda nervous, 'cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and I made it, I swear

Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show

I will dedicate and sacrifice my every
Thing for just a second's worth of how my story's ending
And I wish I could know if the directions that I take
And all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing

Is there something more than what I've been handed?

Use my heart and not my eyes to navigate the darkness

This is the greatest and best song in the world...
Tribute

[Verse 1]
Long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said
""Play the best song in the world
Or I'll eat your soul"" (Soul)

[Verse 2]
Well, me and Kyle
We looked at each other
And we each said
""Okay""
And we played the first thing that came to our heads
Just so happened to be
The best song in the world
It was the best song in the world

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two
Two and one make three
It was destiny
Once every hundred-thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine
And the moon doth glow
And the grass doth grow

[Verse 3]
Needless to say
The beast was stunned
A whip-crack went his whippy tail
And the beast was done
He asked us *snort*
""Be you angels?""
And we said, ""Nay
We are but men!"" Rock
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah
Ohhh, whoah
Ah-whoah-oh

[Chorus]
This is not the greatest song in the world, no
This is just a tribute
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, no
No, this is a tribute, oh
To the greatest song in the world, alright
It was the greatest song in the world, alright
Yeah, it was the best motherfuckin' song
The greatest song in the world

And the peculiar thing is this, my friends
The song we sang on that fateful night
It didn't actually sound anything like this song

This is just a tribute
You've got to believe me
And I wish you were there
Just a matter of opinion
Ah, fuck!
Good God, gotta love it
So surprised to find you can't stop it
A fiery ring of fire

Storming through the party like my name was El Niño
When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing ""act your age""

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

'Cause we like having fun at other people's expense and
Cutting people down is just a minor offense then

In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm too scared of what you think
You make me nervous, so I really can't eat

Honest, let's make this night last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

And rock the masses, from Madrid to Calabasas

You say they know me though, 'cause I be puttin' in work

[Verse 1]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication

[Bridge 1]
The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication

[Verse 2]
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from the squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

[Bridge 3]
Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers
Between supposed lovers

[Outro]
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it every day

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?

[Post-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
It's not right...

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants
And it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone

Never found out why you left him, but this answer begs a question
Too blind to see tomorrow, too broke to beg or borrow
Young and stupid (left wide open)
Hearts are wasted (lives are broken)

One more point of contention, I need some intervention
Approached with vague intentions, betray my short attention
Span the distance (bridge the border)
Beg forgiveness ('round the corner)

Every time I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But every time I look for you, the sun goes down once more

Will the last one out, please shut the door

More time apart will give you a few more months to argue
Is this too much to live through, it always seems too far to drive
The point home (send more letters)
Pray tomorrow (ends up better)

Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

[Chorus 2]
You wanna know what brings me here, oh
You glide through my head, blind to fear
And I know why

[Chorus]
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

[Bridge]
You live too far away
Your voice rings like a bell anyway
Don't give up your independence
Unless it feels so right
Nothing good comes easily
Sometimes you've got to fight

[Chorus]
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally

[Chorus 3]
Launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy
Still, it's fine from afar
And you know that

[Outro]
Whoa, brainstorm, take me away from the norm
Whoa, I got to tell you somethin'

When it's over
That's the time I fall in love again
When it's over
That's the time you're in my heart again
And when you go, go, go, go
I know it never ends
Never ends

All things that I used to say
All words that got in the way
All things that I used to know
Have gone out the window
All things that she used to bring
All songs that she used to sing
All her favorite TV shows
Have gone out the window

I'm missing you
I never knew how much you loved me
I'm missing you
I never knew how much you meant to me
I need you
And when you go, go, go, go
I know it never ends
It never ends

All things that I used to say
All words that got in the way
All things that I used to know
Have gone out the window
All things that she used to bring
All songs that she used to sing
All her favorite TV shows
Have gone out the window

I'm wishing you
You never said you were pretending
I'm wishing you
You'd feel the same and just come back to me
I need you
And when you go, go, go, go
I know it never ends
Never ends

When it's over, can I still come over?
When it's over, is it really over?

When it's over
That's the time I fall in love again

All things that I used to say
All words that got in the way
All things that I used to know
Have gone out the window
All things that she used to bring
All songs that she used to sing

[Intro]
Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs, sieben, acht, neun, aus

[Strophe 1]
Alle warten auf das Licht
Fürchtet euch, fürchtet euch nicht
Die Sonne scheint mir aus den Augen
Sie wird heut Nacht nicht untergeh'n
Und die Welt zählt laut bis zehn

[Refrain]
Eins, hier kommt die Sonne
Zwei, hier kommt die Sonne
Drei, sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Vier, hier kommt die Sonne

[Strophe 2]
Die Sonne scheint mir aus den Händen
Kann verbrennen, kann euch blenden
Wenn sie aus den Fäusten bricht
Legt sich heiß auf das Gesicht
Sie wird heut Nacht nicht untergeh'n
Und die Welt zählt laut bis zehn

[Refrain]
Eins, hier kommt die Sonne
Zwei, hier kommt die Sonne
Drei, sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Vier, hier kommt die Sonne
Fünf, hier kommt die Sonne
Sechs, hier kommt die Sonne
Sieben, sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Acht, Neun, hier kommt die Sonne

[Strophe 3]
Die Sonne scheint mir aus den Händen
Kann verbrennen, kann dich blenden
Wenn sie aus den Fäusten bricht
Legt sich heiß auf dein Gesicht
Legt sich schmerzend auf die Brust
Das Gleichgewicht wird zum Verlust
Lässt dich hart zu Boden gehen
Und die Welt zählt laut bis zehn

[Refrain]
Eins, hier kommt die Sonne
Zwei, hier kommt die Sonne
Drei, sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Vier, und wird nie vom Himmel fallen
Fünf, hier kommt die Sonne
Sechs, hier kommt die Sonne
Sieben, sie ist der hellste Stern von allen
Acht, Neun, hier kommt die Sonne
Aus!

[Verse 1]
You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you, for me
No corner you could squeeze me?
But I got all the time for you, love

[Hook]
The space between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter - keeps us coming back for more
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain

[Verse 2]
But will I hold you again?
These fickle, fuddled words confuse me
Like 'Will it rain today?'
Waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

[Hook 2]
We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild-eyed beast you be
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain

[Breakdown]
Will I hold you again?
Will I hold...
Look at us spinning out in
The madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like
A devil in a church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do, my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

[Hook 3]
The space between
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go
The space between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room
The space between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain
Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Oh, right out of here
Is all we need dear
The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you
The space between
Your heart and mind
Is a space we'll fill with time
The space between
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The space between
Our wicked lies where we hope to keep safe from pain
The space between
The space between

[Chorus 1]
All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

[Verse 1]
Come down don't you resist
You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there?
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

[Chorus 2]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down

[Verse 2]
Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I got nothing to hide
On and on, I got nothing to hide

[Chorus 2]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down

Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

How they stick in your throat

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Drop dead
A bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes
Have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Ignorance
And understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding?
How far
Will we take this?
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me what would you say
I'd say it's up to me

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe

[Bridge]
This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this
Is worthless
Tell me (tell me, tell me)
So
What have we done
With a war that can't be won?
This can't be real
'Cause I don't know what to feel, no

[Chorus]
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
For this world to believe

I couldn't buy an eyeful of sleep
And in the aching night under satellites

Built with stolen parts, a telephone in my heart

To put my mind to bed, this ringing in my head
Is this a cure or is this a disease?

Look into my eyes

She could see inside my head
So I close my eyes
Thinking that I could hide
Disassociate so I don't have to lose my head
This situation leads to agitation
Will she cut me off?
Will this be an amputation?

Fighting all the time
This is out of line

Loves me not

Over the past five years
I have shed my tears
I have drank my beers and watched my fears fly away
And until this day
She still swings my way
But it's sad to say sometimes
She says she loves me not
But I hesitate
To tell her I hate
This relationship
I want out today
This is over

Rhyme for rhyme
Sometimes we be fighting all the goddamn time -it's making me sick
Relationship is getting ill
Piss drunk stupid
Mad

Could you feel what I feel
What's the deal girl?
Tearing up each other's world
We should be in harmony
Boy and girl
That is the promise we made
Back in the day
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
I think we should work this out
It's all right baby we can scream and shout

And part of me is fighting this
But part of me is gone

[Chorus]
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

Or maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared
And love me when I'm gone

Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'd never let you down
Even if I could
I'd give up everything
If only for your good
So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

[Intro]
Yeah...
Here we go...

[Verse 1]
It's a new day, but it all feels old
""It's a good life!"" That's what I'm told
But everything, it all just feels the same
At my high school, it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there, it only made me see

[Pre-Chorus]
That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

[Verse 2]
""Go to college or university
Get a real job!"" That's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm gonna get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you really wanna be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd?
'Cause I don't ever wanna

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You! Don't wanna be you!

[Bridge]
You shake it once, that's fine
You shake it twice, that's okay
You shake it three times
You're playing with yourself again

[Guitar Solo]

[Breakdown]
You! Don't wanna be just like you!
What I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
You! Don't wanna be just like you (Be just like you!)
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me

Another loser anthem (Whoa-oh)
Another loser anthem (Whoa-oh)
Another loser anthem (Whoa-oh)
Another loser anthem!

[Verse 1]
I hear a voice say, ""Don't be so blind""
It's telling me all these things
That you would probably hide
Am I your one and only desire?
Am I the reason you breathe?
Or am I the reason you cry?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
I love you

This life of solitude
I guess that I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you

[Verse 2]
I feel like you don't want me around
I guess I'll pack all my things
I guess I'll see you around
It's all been bottled up until now
As I walk out your door
All I can hear is the sound

[Refrain]
I love you
I hate you
I can't live without you

I left my head around your heart
Why would you tear my world apart?

Always
Always
Always
Always

[Bridge]
I see the blood all over your hands
Does it make you feel more like a man?
Was it all just a part of your plan?
The pistol's shakin' in my hands
And all I hear is the sound

[Chorus]
I love you
I hate you
I can't live without you
I breathe you
I taste you
I can't live without you
I just can't take any more
This life of solitude
I guess that I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you

[Outro]
I love you
I hate you
I can't live without you

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)

To be part of the wave, can't stop

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone

The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

Right on cue

Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
And knowing how to change the things you've been through
I feel I've come to realize
How fast life can be compromised
Step back to see what's going on
I can't believe this happened to you

It's just a problem that I'm faced with; am I
Not the only one who hates to stand by?

Get back, step back, and as for me
I can't believe

All they do is piss and moan
Inside the Rolling Stone
Talking about how hard life can be

If they could spend a day or two walking in someone else's shoes
I think they'd stumble and they'd fall, they would fall, fall...

They're always complaining, always complaining
If money is such a problem
Well, they got mansions, think we should rob them

Kill your wife? And there's no such thing as 25 to life
As long as you've got the cash to pay for Cochran

Smoking crack, McDonald's wouldn't even want to take you back
You could always just run for mayor of D.C.​

[Verse 1]
I'm drunk off your kiss
For another night in a row
This is becoming too routine for me
But I didn't mean to lead you on
And it's alright to pretend
That we still talk
It's just for show, isn't it?
It's my fault that it fell apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Just maybe you need this
And I didn't mean to
Lead you on

[Chorus]
You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started
There's no room left here on my back
It was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true
I'd still pick my friends over you

[Post-Chorus]
My friends over you

[Verse 2]
Please tell me everything
That you think that I should know
About all the plans you made
When I was nowhere to be found
And it's alright to forget
That we still talk
It's just for fun, isn't it?
It's my fault that it fell apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Just maybe you need this
And I didn't mean to
Lead you on

[Chorus]
You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started

It was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true
I'd still pick my friends over
You were everything I wanted
(Everything I wanted)
But I just can't finish what I've started
There's no room left here on my back for you
It was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true
I'd still pick my friends over you

My friends over you!

Eight o'clock, Monday night, and I'm waitin'
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring
She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means

[Pre-Chorus]
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
But she doesn't notice me

[Chorus 1]
'Cause she's watchin' wrestling
Creamin' over tough guys
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', ""Someone shoot me!""
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want

[Verse 2]
She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent Orange
Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have

[Pre-Chorus]
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
She'll never notice me

[Chorus 2]
'Cause she's watchin' wrestling
Creamin' over tough guys
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
She likes 'em with a mustache
Racetrack season pass
Drivin' in a Trans-Am
Does a mullet make a man?
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', ""Someone shoot me!""
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want

[Bridge]
There she goes again
With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated
All I wanted was to see her naked!

[Chorus 3]
Now I'm watchin' wrestling
Tryna be a tough guy
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in my eyes
I can't grow a mustache
And I ain't got no season pass
All I got's a moped (Moped, moped)
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', ""Someone shoot me!""
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want

Another dream that will never come true
Just to compliment your sorrow
Another life that I've taken from you
A gift to add onto your pain and suffering

Another truth you can never believe
Has crippled you, completely
All the cries you're beginning to hear
Trapped in your mind, and the sound is deafening

Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray

Living just isn't hard enough
Burn me alive, inside
Living my life's not hard enough
Take everything away

Another nightmare about to come true
Will manifest, tomorrow
Another love that I've taken from you
Lost in time, on the edge of suffering

Another taste of the evil I breed
Will level you, completely
Bring to life everything that you fear
Live in the dark, and the world is threatening

Let me enlighten you
This is the way I pray

What happened to you?
You played the victim for so long now in this game
What I thought was true
Is made of fiction and I'm following the same
But if I try to make sense of this mess I'm in
I'm not sure where I should begin
I'm falling
I'm falling

Now I'm in over my head
For something I said
Completely misread, I'm better off dead
And now I can see, how fake you can be
This hypocrisy's beginning to get to me

It's none of my concern
Don't look to me 'cause I don't believe in fame
I guess you never heard
I met our makers they don't even know your name
But if I had to say goodbye to leave this hell
I'd say my time has served me well
I'm falling
I'm falling

And now I'm in over my head
With something I said, completely misread I'm better off dead
And now I can't see how fake you can be
This hypocrisy's beginning to get to

This came long before, those who suffer more
I'm too awake for this to be a nightmare
What's with my disgrace I've lost the human race
No one plans for it to, blow up in their face

Who said it was easy to put back all these pieces?
Who said it was so easy to put back all these pieces?

This hypocrisy's beginning to get to me

Yes I did it and I'll do it again

The pain comes back in an ugly design
Her makeup smears
The tears that she cries
Over and over every night
Emotional swords slash my soul
And now the pain it takes control
I think about you
I think about me
Think about the way that it used to be
I need a bottle
I need some pills
I need a friend
I need some thrills
A shoulder to cry on a friend to depend on
When life gets rough

You think about yourself before you think about me
Time and time again
You think about yourself before you think about me

Deep in my heart

The makeup smears
The tears that we cry
Over and over every night

All day
Starin' at the ceilin', makin'
Friends with shadows on my wall
All night
Hearin' voices tellin' me
That I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'

Feelin' like I'm headed for a
Breakdown
And I don't know why

But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see

I know right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

And dodgin' glances on the train
And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me

And it makes me think there must be somethin' wrong

With me
Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

Right now I feel invisible to you, like I'm not real
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you?
Why'd you turn away?

I was left to cry there
Waitin' outside there

Tell me what you thought about when you were gone
And so alone
The worst is over
You can have the best of me
We got older
But we're still young
We never grew out of this feeling that we won't give up

[Verse 2]
Here we lay again
On two separate beds
Riding phone lines
To meet a familiar voice
And pictures drawn from memory
We reflect on miscommunications
And misunderstandings
And missing each other too
Much to have had to let go

We turn our music down
And we whisper
""Say what you're thinking right now""

Tell me what you thought about when you were gone
And so alone
The worst is over

Made me fall away from you
I'm so glad that the truth
Has brought back together me and you

""Say what you're thinking out loud""

We will kiss girl

Tell me what you thought about when you were gone

Feeling that we can’t

The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead
Singin', come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'

You are
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and tickin' clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singin', come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

The love we share seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night

Take my tears and that's not nearly all

Now, I know I've got to run away

But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends

And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

Memories consume like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Be more than one road to our final destination

Go my own way and meet you in the end
Go my own way and meet you in the end

[Intro]
Late night, brakes lock, hear the tires squeal
Red light, can't stop so I spin the wheel
My world goes black before I feel an angel lift me up
And I open bloodshot eyes into fluorescent white
They flip the siren, hit the lights
Close the doors and I am gone

[Verse 1]
Now I lay here owing my life to a stranger
And I realize that empty words are not enough
I'm left here with the question of just
What have I to show except
The promises I never kept?
I lie here shaking on this bed
Under the weight of my regrets

[Chorus]
I hope that I will never let you down
I know that this can be more than just
Flashing lights and sound

[Verse 2]
Look around and you'll see that at times
It feels like no one really cares
It gets me down but I'm still gonna try to do what's right
I know that there's
A difference between sleight of hand
And giving everything you have
There's a line drawn in the sand
I'm working up the will to cross it

[Chorus]
I hope that I will never let you down
I know that this can be more than just
Flashing lights and sound

[Bridge]
Rhetoric can't raise the dead
I'm sick of always talking when there's no change
Rhetoric can't raise the dead
I'm sick of empty words, let's lead and not follow

Late night, brakes lock, hear the tires squeal
Red light, can't stop so I spin the wheel
My world goes black before I feel an angel steal me from the
Greedy jaws of death and chance and
Pull me in with steady hands
They've given me a second chance
The artist in the ambulance

[Outro]
I hope that I will never let you down
I know that this can be more than just
Flashing lights and sound
Can we pick you off the ground?
More than flashing lights and sound

227,The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows,Deja Entendu,Brand New,2003-06-17,241640,59,"

[Verse 1]
We saw the western coast
I saw the hospital
And nursed the shoreline like a wound
Reports of lover's trysts
Were neither clear nor descript
We kept it safe and slow
The quiet things that no one ever knows

[Chorus]
So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day we get tired
Today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lower cases and capitals
So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day we get tired
Today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lower cases and capitals

[Verse 2]
I contemplate the day we wed
Your friends are boring me to death
Your veil is ruined in the rain
By then it's you I can do without
There's nothing new to talk about
And though our kids are blessed
Their parents let them shoulder all the blame

[Chorus]
So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day we get tired
Today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lower cases and capitals
So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day we get tired
Today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lower cases and capitals

[Bridge]
I lie for only you
And I lie well
Halleluh

[Chorus]
So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day we get tired
Today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lower cases and capitals
So keep the blood in your head
And keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day we get tired
Today's the day we dropped out
Gave up my body and bed
All for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lower cases and capitals

228,Lying from You,Meteora (Bonus Edition),Linkin Park,2003-03-24,175373,63,"

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can, but

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm lying my way from

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You (No, no turning back, now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back, now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back, now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back, now)
The very worst part of you is me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And now, you think this person really is me
And I'm trying to bend the truth
But the more I push, the more I'm pulling away
'Cause I'm lying my way from

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You (No, no turning back, now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back, now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back, now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back, now)
The very worst part of you
The very worst part of you is me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me like this
This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me like this
(This) This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me like this
(This) This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me like this

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
You (No, no turning back, now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back, now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back, now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back, now)

The very worst part of you is me

I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands, they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
So here I am, I'm trying
So here I am, are you ready?

Come on, let me hold you, touch you, feel you, always
Kiss you, taste you all night, always

[Verse 1]
Tilling my own grave to keep me level
Jam another dragon down the hole
Digging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren
One that pushes me along and leaves me so

[Chorus]
Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China White as Dracula as I approach the bottom

[Chorus]
Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

[Bridge]
Little angel go away, come again some other day
The devil has my ear today, I'll never hear a word you say
He promised I would find a little solace and some peace of mind
Whatever just as long as I don't feel so

[Chorus]
Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Over you

And even though I know
That everything might go
Go downhill from here, I'm not afraid

This is my life
It's not what it was before
All these feelings I've shared
And these are my dreams
That I'd never lived before
Somebody shake me, 'cause I

And now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
And all the mistakes one life contained

And I feel like I can face the day
And I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today

I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this!)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this!)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this!)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this!)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this!)
I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this!)

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna

Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this!)
Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this!)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feelin' this!)
Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this!)

This place was never the same again after you
Came and went, how could you say you meant anything
Different to anyone standing alone on the
Street with a cigarette on the first night we met
Look to the past and remember and smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene, I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you

Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
I'll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned)
Fate fell short this time (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)
Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine (Are we alone? Do you feel it?)

Who's the man? (the-the man, the-the man in the middle)
Who's the man? (who-who, who's the man-man-man?)

[Verse 1]
When I reminisce, ignorance was bliss
Back in the days where the magic exist
Never be the same as it was, 'cause the way it was
Just another day in the maze of a myth
Had a lot of fun livin' life on the run
Never had chance to pause to get a better glance
Everything was free and everything was fast
Never even thought it wouldn't last
When you got the mind of a man in the middle
Life is just a big fat riddle, so figure it out
Always thinkin' that you know every little thing there is to know
But you don't really know, you know?
It's like love, some people get it
For some it's just a glove that just never fitted
For me, it's just a pain in the ass
But I'm addicted to the taste of hopin' it could last

[Chorus]
Another day, another night inside a lonely world
Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world

Who's the man? (the-the, the-the man, man in the middle)
Who's the man? (man, man-man in the middle, in the middle)
Who's the man? (who-who's the man?)

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm a target for people that are bitter
At least I can say that I've never been a quitter
I remember high school, man, I hated high school
It was like prison with bullies always puttin' me down
Just a little skater-boy they could pick on
I learned to forgive 'em, now I got the balls they can lick on
I loved sneakin' out when my mom was asleep
With my Gothic girlfriend makin' love in the creek
With the mind of a man in the middle
It could be the end of the world as we know it
Still, I never want it all and I never want it now
I just wanna cruise, if I lose, then I'll figure it out
How the times files, even with the blink of an eye
When you're young, you absorb like a sponge in disguise
Then you get a little older and gather your thoughts
It's was amazing what you learn when you've never been taught, you know?

[Chorus]
Another day, another night inside a lonely world
Another game, another fight inside a lonely world
Another wrong, another right inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world

[Bridge]
No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world (Such a lonely world)
No matter how hard I can try inside a lonely world
No one can hear me when I cry inside a lonely world
I'll never know the reasons why inside a lonely world
Such a lonely world, such a lonely world

Another day, another night inside a lonely world
Another game, another fight inside a lonely world

And found you, found you on the way
And now, it is silver and silent, it is silver and cold
You, in somber resplendence, I hold

And I'll beg for forgiveness

Light, like the flutter of wings, feel your hollow voice rushing into me
As you're longing to sing
So I, I will paint you in silver, I will wrap you in cold

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While you're looking up at me
You're like my favourite damn disease

And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say no
Too many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose

And I love the good times that you wreck
And I love your lack of self-respect

We started living in an old house
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out
It was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy
It was a ray gun, and it was 1981

[Verse 2]
We named him 'Baby', he had a toothache
He started crying, it sounded like an earthquake
It didn't last long, because I stopped it
I grabbed a rag doll and stuck some little pins in it

[Verse 3]
Now we're a family, and we're alright now
We got money, and a little place to fight now
We don't know you, and we don't owe you
But if you see us around, I got something else to show you

Now it's easy when you don't know better
You think it's sleazy? Then put it in a short letter
We keep warm, but there's just something wrong with you
Just feel that you're the hardest little button to button

[Verse 5]
I had opinions that didn't matter
I had a brain that felt like pancake batter
I got a backyard with nothing in it
Except a stick, a dog, and a box with something in it

Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep

This night is wild, so calm and dull
These hearts, they race, from self control
Your legs are smooth as they graze mine

So won't you kill me, so I die happy?
My heart is yours to fill or burst to break or bury
Or wear as jewelry, whichever you prefer

The words are hushed, let's not get busted
Just lay entwined here, undiscovered
Safe in here from all the stupid questions
""Hey, did you get some?"" Man, that is so dumb
Stay quiet, stay near, stay close, they can't hear
So we can get some

My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me

Hands down, this is the best day I can
Ever remember, I'll always remember the sound
Of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights
The scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers
And the time on the clock when we realized it's so late
And this walk that we shared together
The streets were wet, and the gate was locked
So I jumped it and I let you in
And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist
And you kissed me like you meant it
And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it, that you meant it
And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it

And I fell in love with everyone I saw
Please take your time, I'm not in any rush
And it's in everything I ever write

[Chorus 2]
It's not as if I need the extra weight
Confused enough by life, so thanks a lot
Lonely written words for company
Just raise the roof this once and follow me

[Chorus 1]
I struggle for the words and then give up
My head's up with the birds on the T hut
A little peace of mind that I know better
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters

Clever got me this far
Then tricky got me in
Eye on what I'm after

Smile and drop the cliché
'Til you think I'm listening
Take just what I came for
Then I'm out the door again

Peripheral on the package
Don't care to settle in
Time to feed the monster
I don't need another friend
Comfort is a mystery
Crawling out of my own skin
Just give me what I came for
Then I'm out the door again

Lie to get what I came for
Lie to get just what I need
Lie to get what I crave
Lie and smile to get what's mine

Eye on what I'm after

Nod and watch your lips move
If you need me to pretend

Call me out, you stayed inside
The one you love is where you hide
Shot me down, as I flew by
Crash and burn, I think sometimes
You forget where the heart is

Answer ""no"" to these questions
Let her go, learn a lesson
It's not me, you're not listening
Now, can't you see? Something's missing
You forget where the heart is

Take you away
From that empty apartment you stay
And forget where the heart is, someday
If ever you loved me you'd say ""it's okay""

How's your life? What's it like there?
Is it all what you want it to be?
Does it hurt when you think about me
And how broken my heart is?

It's okay to be angry and never let go
It only gets harder the more that you know
When you get lonely, if no one's around
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down

And I know how it feels to walk out on your own
Maybe some day I will see you again
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend

Don't look back into the sun
You've cast your pearls but you're on the run
And all the lies you said, who did you save?

But when they played that song at the Death Disco
It started fast but it ends so slow
And all the time just reminded me of you

So sweetheart, tell me what's up, I won't stop
No way

Please keep your hands down, and stop raising your voice

It's a simple suggestion, can you give me some time?
So just say yes or no, why can't you shoulder the blame?
Cause both my shoulders are heavy from the weight of us both
You're a big boy now, so let's not talk about growth
You've not heard a single word I have said...
Oh, my god

Please take it easy it can't all be my fault
I haven't made half the mistakes that you've listed so far
Baby, let me explain something, it's all down to drugs

[Verse 1]
Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss; how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss; it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look; it's killing me
They're taking control

[Chorus]
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

No one ever died for my sins in Hell

'Least the ones I got away with

This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe

Sitting on my crucifix
The living room, or my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane

It's beating out of time

Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the Earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned 24
Only been with one man, what happened to her plan?
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

[Chorus]
Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985, 1985

[Verse 2]
She's seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand on a member of Duran Duran
Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows on the radio?

I’ve given up on giving up slowly
I’m blending in so you won’t even know me
Apart from this whole world that shares my fate
This one last bullet you mention
Is my one last shot at redemption
'Cause I know to live, you must give your life away

And I’ve been housing all this doubt and insecurity
And I’ve been locked inside that house
All the while You hold the key
And I’ve been dying to get out and that might be the death of me

I promise I’m going because

'Cause I've failed and I’m ready to be shown how
You've told me the way and now I'm trying to get there

I admit that I'm every bit deserving
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair

Self-detained and forced to live in this mess I've made

Landing somewhere far from here
With no one else around
To catch you falling down

Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour

Will they open their eyes
And realize we are one
On and on we stand alone
Until our day has come
When they open their eyes
And realize we are one
Still today we carry on
I know our day will come
When they open their eyes
And realize we are one

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Will they open their eyes
And realize we are one?
(It's hard to walk this path alone
Hard to know which way to go)
Will they open their eyes
And realize we are one?
(Lost the faith and lost the love
When the day is done)
Will they open their eyes
And realize we are one?

It's been a long year
Since you've been gone
I've been alone here
I've grown old
I fall to pieces, I'm falling
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling

Every time I'm falling down
All alone I fall to pieces

I keep a journal of memories
I'm feeling lonely, I can't breathe
I fall to pieces, I'm falling
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling

All the years I've tried
With more to go
Will the memories die
I'm waiting
Will I find you
Can I find you
We're falling down
I'm falling

Every time I’m falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I’m falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I’m falling down
All alone I fall to pieces
Every time I’m falling down

Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you?
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room

That no one hears your screaming?

No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like

Watching the people get lairy
It's not very pretty I tell thee
Walking through town is quite scary
It's not very sensible either
A friend of a friend he got beaten
He looked the wrong way at a policeman
Would never have happened to Smeaton
An Old Leodensian

Ah...la la la la la

I tried to get to my taxi
The man in a tracksuit attacks me
He said that he saw it before me
And wants to get things a bit gory
Girls scrabble round with no clothes on
To borrow a pound for a condom
If it wasn't for chip fat they'd be frozen
They're not very sensible

[Pre-Chorus]
La...la la la la la
Ah...la la la la la

I predict a riot

One, take control of me?
You're messing with the enemy
Said it's two, it's another trick
Messing with my mind, I wake up
Chase down an empty street
Blindly snap the broken beats
Said it's gone, with the dirty trick
It's taken all these days to find ya

Friends, take control of me

All these pills got to operate
The colour quits and all invade us
There it goes again
Take me to the edge again
All I got, is a dirty trick
I'm chasing down all wolves to save ya

Auf den Wellen wird gefochten
Wo Fisch und Fleisch zur See geflochten
Der eine sticht die Lanz' im Heer
Der andere wirft sie in das Meer
Ah - Ahoi

[Refrain]
Reise, Reise Seemann Reise
Jeder tut's auf seine Weise
Der eine stößt den Speer zum Mann
Der andere zum Fische dann
Reise, Reise Seemann Reise
Und die Wellen weinen leise
In ihrem Blute steckt ein Speer
Bluten leise in das Meer

Die Lanze muss im Fleisch ertrinken
Fisch und Mann zur Tiefe sinken
Wo die schwarze Seele wohnt
Ist kein Licht am Horizont
Ah - Ahoi

Rosemary
Heaven restores you in life
You're coming with me
Through the aging, the fearing, the strife
It's the smiling on the package
It's the faces in the sand
It's the thought that moves you upwards
Embracing me with two hands
Right will take you places
Yeah, maybe to the beach
When your friends, they do come crying
Tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow release

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not
Denial
But hey, who's on trial?

It took a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?

[Verse 2]
He speaks about travel
Yeah, we think about the land
We smart like all peoples
Feeling real tan
I could take you places
Do you need a new man?
Wipe the pollen from the faces
Make revision to a dream while you wait in the van

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, wait
Great smile
Sensitive to fate, not
Denial
But hey, who's on trial?

It took a life span with no cell mate
By the long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, you are exotic
You need something for which to care
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?

[Verse 3]
Leave some shards under the belly
Lay some grease inside my hand
It's a sentimental jury
And the makings of a good plan
You've come to love me lightly
Yeah, you come to hold me tight
Is this motion everlasting
Or do shudders pass in the night?
Rosemary
Oh, heaven restores you in life

[Chorus]
I spent a life span with no cell mate
The long way back
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
You're weightless, semi-erotic
You need someone to take you there
Sandy, why can't we look the other way?
Why can't we just play the other game?
Why can't we just look the other way?

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

[Chorus]
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

[Verse 2]
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry

Your body may be gone, I'm gonna carry you in
In my head, in my heart, in my soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again
Well, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, don't think so

[Chorus 1]
Well, that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well, thanks for the time, I needed to think a spell
I had to think awhile, I had to think awhile

The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old

Well, that is that and this is this
Will you tell me what you saw, and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met the sky (You missed)
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye
(You missed)
When the Earth folded in on itself (You missed)
And said ""Good luck, for your sake I hope Heaven and Hell
(You missed, you missed)
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath""
(You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?
(You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?

[Verse 3]
The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
The more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind
Well, I don't mind, I don't mind
How the hell could I mind?

[Chorus 2]
Well, that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Well, that is that and this is this
Will you tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met the sky (You missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste the afterlife?

Take your white finger
Slide the nail under the top and bottom buttons of my blazer
Relax the fraying wool, slacken ties
And I'm not to look at you in the shoe
But the eyes find the eyes

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine

[Verse 2]
Time every journey to bump into you accidentally
I charm you and tell you of the boys I hate, all the girls I hate
All the words I hate, all the clothes I hate
How I'll never be anything I hate
You smile, mention something that you like
Oh, how you'd have a happy life if you did the things you like

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
You will find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

[Verse 3]
I’m drunk and I’m feeling down
And I just want to be alone
You shouldn’t have come around
Why don’t you just go home
'Cause you’re drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn’t understand
(But you didn’t understand)
Go fix yourself!

[Bridge]
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I got to move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I got to move on with my own life

[Chorus]
I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel
I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

[Verse 1]
I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?

[Chorus]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?

[Verse 2]
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose

[Verse 3]
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Break]
Ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh

[Chorus]
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Verse 4]
I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

[Chorus]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwed as me
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be

Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity

Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
Cause I'm the next big thing

You could have been all I wanted
But you weren't honest
Now get in the ground
You choked off the surest of favors
But if you really loved me
You would have endured my world
Well if you're just as I presumed
A whore in sheep's clothing
Fucking up all I do
And if so here we stop
Then never again
Will you see this in your life

Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

You stormed off to scar the armada
Like Jesus played letter
I'll drill through your hands
The stone for the curse you have blamed me
With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep
But if you could just write me out
To neverless wonder, happy will I become
Be true that this is no option
So with sin, I condemn you
Demon play, demon out

Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs

Please make up your mind, girl

With words, but I'm worse

I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late

Always on, (Always on) you said you'd keep me honest
Always on, (Always on) but I won't call you on it
Always on, (Always on)

I don't blame you for being you

[Verse 1]
In this hole that is me
The dead are rolling over
In this hole, thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I feel it in me, so overwhelmed
Oh, this pressured center rising
My life overturned, unfair the despair
All these scars keep ripping open

[Chorus]
Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

[Verse 2]
In this hole that is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole, so limiting
The sun has set, all darkens

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Buried underneath, hands slip off the wheel
Internal path-way to contention

[Chorus]
Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

[Bridge]
Are you happy?
Are you happy?
Are you feeling
Happy?
In this hole that is me
Left with a heart exhausted
What's my release? What sets me free?
Do you pull me up just to push me down again?

[Chorus]
Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Peel me from the skin

Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear me from the bone

Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy
Are you fucking happy
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing?
Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you fucking happy
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing?

I must’ve dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They’re moving into the street
Now, did you read the news today?
They say the danger’s gone away
But I can see the fire’s still alight
There, burning into the night

There’s too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And there’s not much love to go ‘round
Can’t you see
This is a land of confusion?

And these are the hands we’re given
Use them, and let’s start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh, Superman, where are you now?
When everything’s gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour

So, we look for the future
But there’s not much love to go ‘round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

My generation will put it right
We’re not just making promises

Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain, spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard, catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave

Yeah, and to be yourself is all that you can do
Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do

Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays
Someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away
Separate or united, healthy or insane

To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh

In a perfect situation, I let love down the drain

Cause I could not have it better, but I just can't get no play
From the girls, all around as they search the night for
Someone to hold onto and I just pass through

And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

I’ll need a, a credit card that’s got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

Hanging above as the canyon comes between

[Verse 1]
Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slaving away

[Chorus]
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

[Verse 2]
Take a look around you; nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What's left to believe?

[Chorus]
Ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, if there's one thing I hang onto

Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face

[Intro]
Change my attempt, good intentions

[Verse 1]
Crouched over, you were not there, living in fear
But signs were not really that scarce, obvious tears
But I will not hide you through this, I want you to help them
Please see the bleeding heart perched on my shirt
Die, withdraw, hide in cold sweat, quivering lips
Ignore remorse, naming a kid, living wasteland
This time you've tried all that you can, turning you red

[Chorus]
Change my attempt, good intentions
Should I? Could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I? Could I?

[Verse 2]
Crowned, hopeless, the article read, ""living wasteland""
This time you've tried all that you can, turning you red
But I will not hide you through this, I want you to help

[Chorus]
Change my attempt, good intentions
Should I? Could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I? Could I?

[Bridge]
Heave the silver, hollow sliver
Piercing through another victim
Turn and tremble, be judgmental
Ignorant to all the symbols
Blind the face with beauty paste
Eventually, you'll one day know

[Chorus]
Change my attempt, good intentions
Limbs tied, skin tight
Self inflicted his perdition
Should I? Could I?
Change my attempt, good intentions
Should I? Could I?

Tell me that you're alright
Yeah, everything is alright
Oh please, tell me that you're alright
Yeah, everything is alright

[Verse 1: Justin Pierre]
Give me a reason
To end this discussion
To break with tradition
To fold and divide
'Cause I hate the ocean, theme parks, and airplanes
Talking with strangers, waiting in line..
I'm through with these pills that make me sit still
""Are you feeling fine?"" Yes, I feel just fine

Tell me that you're alright
Yeah, everything is alright
Oh please, tell me that you're alright

I'm sick of the things I do when I'm nervous
Like cleaning the oven or checking my tires
Or counting the number of tiles in the ceiling..
Head for the hills, the kitchen's on fire!
I used to rely on self-medication
I guess I still do that from time to time
But I'm getting better at fighting the future
""Someday you'll be fine..."" Yes, I'll be just fine

Tell me that you're alright

To end this discussion (Of anything I've heard)
To break with tradition (They tell me that it's not so hard)

So let's not get carried (Away with everything)
Away with the process (From here to in-between)
Of elimination (The long goodbye)
I don't want to waste your time

Tell me that you're alright
Yeah, everything is alright
Oh please, tell me that you're alright

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then

If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, ""Son
Fear is the heart of love,"" so I never went back

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""No""s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Bridge]
You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down; the time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

[Chorus]
And if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the ""No""s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Intro]
I found the cure to growing older
And you're the only place that feels like home
Just so you know, you'll never know, and some secrets weren't meant to be told
But I found the cure to growing older

[Verse 1]
I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again
And I've got arrogance down to a science
Oh, and I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends now

[Chorus]
Douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the
Way you are, you can't cover it up
Can't cover it up
So douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the
Way you are, can't cover it up
Can't cover it up, no

[Verse 2]
Find a safe place, brace yourself, bite your lips
I'm sending your fingernails and empty bottles you've sipped
Back to your family 'cause I know you will be missed
So you can find a safe place

[Pre-Chorus]
Brace yourself, they call kids like us vicious
And carved out of stone
But, for what we've become, we just feel more alone
Always weigh what I've got against what I left
So, progress report: I am missing you to death

[Chorus]
Douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the
Way you are, you can't cover it up
Can't cover it up
So douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the
Way you are, can't cover it up
Can't cover it up, no

Someone old, no one new, feeling borrowed, always blue

I've found the cure to growing older

Won't even bother now to tell me why

When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know

Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses

It was 100 degrees
As we sat beneath a willow tree
Whose tears didn't care—they just hung in the air
And refused to fall, to fall
And I knew I'd made a horrible call
And now, the state line felt like the Berlin Wall
And there was no doubt about which side I was on
Mhm

'Cause I built you a home in my heart
With rotten wood, and it decayed from the start

If there was nothing there all along
No, you can’t find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along

I braved treacherous streets
And kids strung out on homemade speed
And we shared a bed in which I could not sleep
At all, woohoo, woohoo, ooh
'Cause at night the sun in retreat
Made the skyline look like crooked teeth
In the mouth of a man who was devouring us both

You're so cute when you're slurring your speech
But they're closing the bar, and they want us to leave

And you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can’t find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along

And it's always this way
My head is weak, and my heart always speaks
Before I know what it will say

And you can't find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can’t find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
No, you can’t find nothing at all
If there was nothing there all along
There were churches, theme parks, and malls
But there was nothing there all along

[Verse 2]
Ask yourself
Will I burn in Hell?
Then write it down
And cast it in the well
There they are
The mob it cries for blood
To twist the tale
Into fire wood
Fan the flames
With a little lie
Then turn your cheek
Until the fire dies
The skin it peels
Like the truth, away
What it was
I will never say

[Chorus 2]
Bite your tongue
Swear to keep your mouth shut
Make up something
Make up something good

Holding hands
Skipping like a stone
Burn the witch
Burn to ash and bone
Burn the witch
Burn to ash and bone
Burn the witch

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before

On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young

And see the place where you used to live

In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

What in the world, what does your company take me for?

On her merry way sayin', ""Baby, what you gonna—?""

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man, what did you have in mind?
“What have you come to do?”
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see, the lights are blue

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Come and get it, lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, 'cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away, can't take it for another minute

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high, it's only promising
This place was made on you

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where do you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle Brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis]
Chitty-chitty, baby, when your nose is in the nitty-gritty
Life could be a little sweet, but life could be a little shitty
What a pity, Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred, but you only ever found a fifty

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind

Down to the ocean
It’s only water and sand
And in the ocean we'll hold hands

Without an answer, the thunder speaks for the sky, and on the cold wet dirt I cry

On your bones?

Like the holiest dream
There's someone calling
An angel whispers my name
But the message relayed is the same:
""Wait till tomorrow, you'll be fine.""
But it's gone to the dogs in my mind
I always hear them when the dead of night
Comes calling to save me from this fight
But they can never wrong this right

I know if destiny’s kind, I’ve got the rest of my mind
But my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to
And my eyes, they don’t see you no more
And my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don’t recognize you no more

For reasons unknown
For reasons unknown

There was an open chair
We sat down in the open chair
I said if destiny’s kind, I’ve got the rest of my mind
But my heart, it don’t beat, it don’t beat the way it used to
And my eyes, they don’t see you no more
And my lips, they don’t kiss, they don’t kiss the way they used to
And my eyes don’t recognize you at all

If I told you things I did before
Told you how I used to be
Would you go along with someone like me?
If you knew my story word for word
Had all of my history
Would you go along with someone like me?

[Verse 2: Victoria Bergsman]
I did before and had my share
It didn't lead nowhere
I would go along with someone like you
It doesn't matter what you did
Who you were hanging with
We could stick around and see this night through

And we don't care about the young folks
Talking 'bout the young style
And we don't care about the old folks
Talking 'bout the old style too
And we don't care about their own faults
Talking 'bout our own style
All we care 'bout is talking
Talking only me and you

[Verse 3: Victoria Bergsman, Peter Morén, Both]
Usually when things has gone this far
People tend to disappear
No one will surprise me unless you do
I can tell there's something going on
Hours seems to disappear
Everyone is leaving I'm still with you
It doesn't matter what we do
Where we are going too
We can stick around and see this night through

[Chorus]
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh, God, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Verse 1]
How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
Like paper dolls and little notes, you can't expect a bit of hope
So while you're outside looking in, describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Verse 2]
How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart, but never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises, null and void instead of voices
Before you tell yourself, it's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

[Chorus]
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Bridge]
And it's the stars, the stars
That shine for you
And it's the stars, the stars
That lie to you, yeah-ah
And it's the stars, the stars
That shine for you
And it's the stars, the stars
That lie to you, yeah-ah

[Chorus]
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh, God, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

Just these three miserable cunts
Sitting on the back seat, tapping on the off beat
We know you love us and you probably do
Although your husband may cut us
He's an animal, though anything is possible

Give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
It's hard to miss you when you follow us about
Buy us some shoes and maybe take us for cola
We'll get you there in some filthy big gondola
And it's, clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
You can come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts
These are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on

I wanna have the same last dream again
The one where I wake up and I'm alive
Just as the four walls close me within
My eyes are opened up with pure sunlight
I'm the first to know my dearest friends

Anything that's dead shall be re-grown
And your vicious pain, your warning sign
You will be fine

Like every single tree reach for the sky
If you're gonna fall, I'll let you know

Where everyone was working for this goal
Where all the children left without a trace
Only to come back, as pure as gold
To recite this all

It's not about your make-up or how you try to shape up
To these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey
So now you pour your heart out, you're telling me you're far out
But not about to lie down for your cause
But you don't pull my strings
'Cause I'm a better man moving on to better things

[Chorus]
Well, uh-oh, oh, I love her because she moves in her own way
Well, uh-oh, oh, she came to my show just to hear about my day

[Verse 2]
And at the show on Tuesday, she was in her mind, see
Tempered furs and spangled boots
Looks are deceiving, make me believe it
And these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey, yeah
So won't you go far, tell them you're a keeper
Not about to lie down for your cause
And you don't pull my strings
'Cause I'm a better man moving on to better things

[Chorus]
Well, uh-oh, oh, I love her because she moves in her own way
Well, uh-oh, oh, she came to my show just to hear about my day

[Bridge]
Yes, I wish that we never made it there through all the summers
And kept them up instead of kicking us back down to the suburbs
Yes, I wish that we never made it there through all the summers
And kept them up instead of kicking us back down to the suburbs

[Chorus]
But uh-oh, I love her because she moves in her own way
But uh-oh, she came to my show just to hear about my day
But uh-oh, oh, I love her because she moves in her own way
But uh-oh, oh, she came to my show just to hear about my day

[Verse 1]
You are one of God's mistakes
You crying, tragic waste of skin
I'm well aware of how it aches
And you still won't let me in

Now, I'm breaking down your door
To try and save your swollen face
Though I don't like you anymore
You lying, trying waste of space

[Chorus]
Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And a voice that made me cry
My, oh, my

[Verse 2]
You were mother nature's son
Someone to whom I could relate
Your needle and your damage done
Remains a sordid twist of fate

Now, I'm tryin' to wake you up
To pull you from the liquid sky
'Cause if I don't, we'll both end up
With just your song to say goodbye
My, oh, my

A song to say goodbye
A song to say goodbye
A song to say

[Chorus]
Before our innocence was lost
You were always one of those
Blessed with lucky sevens
And a voice that made me cry

It's a song to say goodbye
It's a song to say goodbye

Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay

I'll be off to find another way

You're still a good-for-nothing, I don't know

Better get out while you can

""I don't love you like I did yesterday""?

So sick and tired of all the needless beating

Another dollar's just another blow

You spend your days counting the hours you're awake
And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
It's a burden you've been burying in spite of all your prayers
As the light turns off inside your heart can you remember
What it's like to care?
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go
Pull this plug, let me breath

Don't let me go

The trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
If you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
With the memories that haunt us, I cherish just the same
As the ones that bring us closer to the sky, no matter how grave
Yet I fall through these clouds and she's screaming

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go
Pull this plug, let me breath

This grip loosens but it never breaks
We carry nothing but a name you will forsake
Your words are always there to break my fall
And now I find the comfort to see through it all

Guide me through uncharted waters
Before we lose our way again
Will you be my compass
Until forever, until forever ends
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

Give me what's left of my life

I find the map and draw a straight line
Over rivers, farms, and state lines
The distance from ""A"" to where you'd ""B""
It's only finger-lengths that I see
I touch the place
Where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases
Of distant dark places

[Verse 2: Gary Lightbody & Martha Wainwright]
I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science
Their words, mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that somethin' picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have travelled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weepin'
A joy you can't keep in

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I

I hold on so nervously to me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should
This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me

Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me

But its feeling just like every other morning before
Now I wonder what my life is going to mean if it's gone
The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour at that
I started staring at the passengers who're waving goodbye
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?

But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come

I think it turned ten o'clock but I don't really know
Then I can't remember caring for an hour or so
Started crying and I couldn't stop myself
I started running but there's no where to run to
I sat down on the street and took a look at myself
Said where you going man you know the world is headed for hell
Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye to

I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out

There is no one on the corner and there's no one at home

Now it's over for me, and it's over for you

String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach, somewhere

May be out of his mind (Out of his mind)

Well, I won't be caught living in a dead-end job
While praying to my government, guns, and God
Now it's us against them, we're here to represent
And spit right in the face of the establishment

And now I don't believe (in having faith in nothing)
Stand on my own (and got no sympathy)
Wasting the youth (while being young and useless)
Speak for yourself (and don't pray for me)

Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
Be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you

Burning the flag (of the degeneration)

Before the story begins
Is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine
Until the end of time?
We were more than friends
Before the story ends
And I will take what's mine
Create what God would never design

[Verse 2: M. Shadows & The Rev]
Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears (Ahahaha)
Conjuring her deepest fears (Come here you fucking bitch)
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it
She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
Now she's just so perfect, I've never been quite so fucking deep in her
It goes on and on, and on
I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

[Chorus: M. Shadows]
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
Baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry

Now possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehave
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it (Eat the shit out of it)
Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize
From somewhere far beyond the grave
I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

[Chorus: M. Shadows]
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye

'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah

I will suffer for so long
(What will you do? Not long enough)
To make it up to you

[Verse 1]
Lie, lie to my face
Tell me it ain't nothing
That's what I wanna hear
Take the lie to the grave
That's what an old friend told me
Look what it did for him
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss then I'm in heaven now

[Verse 2]
Run, you'll never escape
You'll see you go nowhere
So new you appear
Broke, laid to waste
Turn into sweet nothings
Kiss you goodbye
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say?
So why tell it?
If ignorance is bliss then I'm in heaven now

[Bridge]
Keep going over and over again
The never ending places I've never been
No one's catching on, calling my bluff
The Devil made me holier than every man

[Outro]
What'd you do? Say it with a smile, boy
Making us all forget
What'd you do? Say it with a smile, boy
Making us all forget
Making us all forget
Making us all forget

[Verse 1]
I don't mind where you come from
As long as you come to me
But I don't like illusions
I can't see them clearly
I don't care, no I wouldn't dare
To fix the twist in you
You've shown me eventually what you'll do
I don't mind, I don't care
As long as you're here

[Hook]
Go ahead and tell me you'll leave again
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are
If you take me for everything
And do it all over again
It's all the same

[Verse 2]
Hours slide and days go by
Until you decide to come
But in-between it always seems too long for certain
But I have the skill, yeah I have the will
To breathe you in while I can
However long you stay is all that I am
I don't mind, I don't care
As long as you're here

[Hook]
Go ahead and tell me you'll leave again
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are
If you take me for everything
And do it all over again
It's all the same

[Verse 3]
Wrong or right
Black or white
If I close my eyes
Its all the same
In my life
The compromise
I'll close my eyes
Its all the same

[Hook]
Go ahead, say it
You're leaving
You'll just come back running
Holding your scarred heart in hand
It's all the same
And I'll take you for who you are now
If you take me for everything
Do it all over again
It's all the same

[Intro: Girls Singing]
(If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me)

[Intro: Justin's Mother]
(”Hi Justin, this is your mother, and it's 2:33 on Monday afternoon
I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)

[Verse 1: Justin Furstenfeld]
I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space

[Chorus: Justin Furstenfeld]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

[Verse 2: Justin Furstenfeld]
I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicide and hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

[Chorus: Justin Furstenfeld]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

[Bridge: Justin Furstenfeld]
And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

[Chorus: Justin Furstenfeld]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
For you
For you
For you

[Intro/Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
I remember when all the games began
Remember every little lie and every last goodbye
Promises you broke, words you choked on
And I never walked away
It's still a mystery to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I'm so empty
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me
Well, you're so unclean
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me

[Chorus]
The lying, the bleeding, the screaming
Was tearing me apart
The hatred (deceiving), the beatings; it's over

[Verse 2]
Paint the mirrors black to forget you
I still picture your face (still picture your face)
And the way you used to taste (way you used to taste)
Roses in a glass, dead and wilted
To you, this all was nothing
Everything to you is nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you're so filthy
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me
Well, I'm so ugly
You're better off without me and I'm better off alone
(Right!)

[Chorus]
The lying, the bleeding, the screaming
Was tearing me apart
The hatred, the beatings (disaster); it's over

(Why?) As wicked as you are
You're beautiful to me
(Why?) You're the darkest burning star
You're my perfect disease

Was tearing me apart

Disaster
The lying, the bleeding, the screaming
Was tearing me apart
The hatred, the beatings; it's over
Disaster

Last summer, we took threes across the board
But by fall, we were a cover story, ""Now in stores!""

[Pre-Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an acceptance speech
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update

So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five

I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave
Of my hand, 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am

The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards

521,Into the Night (feat. Chad Kroeger),Ultimate Santana,Santana,2007-09-25,222440,58,"

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands
And we sang

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night

Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces
She was spinning in circles with the moon in her eyes
No room left to move in between you and I
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night
And we sang

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh
Ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night

It was love from above, that could save me from hell
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me

Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands

[Verse 1]
He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
Started making his way past 2 in the morning
He hasn't been sober for days
Leaning now into the breeze
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
They had breakfast together
But two eggs don't last
Like the feeling of what he needs

[Pre-Chorus]
Now this place seems familiar to him
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in

[Chorus]
Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

[Verse 2]
And even though she doesn't believe in love
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads, though he tries
But he's only denied
Now he's dying to get inside

[Chorus]
Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

[Bridge]
The neighbors said she moved away
Funny how it rained all day
I didn't think much of it then
But it's starting to all make sense
Oh, I can see now that all of these clouds
Are following me in my desperate endeavor
To find my whoever, wherever she may be

[Juliet Simms:]
I'm not coming back (forgive me)
I've done something so terrible
I'm terrified to speak (I'm not calling, I'm not calling)
But you'd expect that from me
I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt, now the rain is just (You're driving me crazy, I'm)
Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
Keeping an eye on the world
From so many thousands of feet off the ground
I'm over you now, I'm at home in the clouds
And towering over your head

[Outro: Alex Gaskarth:]
Well I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home now
I guess I'll go home

Ah, icky thump, who'da thunk?
Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico
Ahh well, what a chump
Well, my head got a bump when I hit it on the radio
Redhead señorita looking dead
Came and said, ""Need a bed?"" in Español
I said, ""Gimme a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar, and I don't need a microphone""

[Verse 2]
Icky thump with a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat, and I was freaking, I was ready to go
And I swear besides the hair she had one white eye
One blank stare, looking up, lying there
On the stand near her hand was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane, dry ice and something strange
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

[Verse 3]
White Americans, what? Nothing better to do
Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too
Who's using who? What should we do?
Well, you can't be a pimp and a prostitute too
Icky thump, handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind, looked around, and there was nobody else
Left alone, I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how to clean up after myself

Here now don't make a sound
Say have you heard the news today
One flag was taken down
To raise another in its place
A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unchanged
No home, no life, no love
No stranger singing in your name

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe the season
The colours change in the valley skies
Dear God I've sealed my fate
Running through hell, heaven can wait

[Chorus]
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

[Verse 2]
Let's say we take this town
No king or queen of any state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the gates
I know one wall to scale
I know a field without a name
Head on without a care
Before it's way too late

Maybe the season
The colours change in the valley skies
Oh God I've sealed my fate

Forever gone without a trace
Your horizon takes its shape
No turning back, don't turn that page

Come now, I'm leaving here tonight
Come now, let's leave it all behind
Is that the price you pay
Running through hell, heaven can wait

No tomorrow, no dead ends
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends
Long road to ruin there in your eyes

No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

Unfurl your black wings and wait
Across the horizon it's coming to sweep you away

Beyond the suffering you've known
I hope you find your way

Know that you made such a difference

The sun is gone and the flowers rot
Words are spaces between us
And I should have been drowned
In the rivers I found of token lost
And I should have been down
When you made me insecure

So break me down if it makes you feel right
And hate me now if it keeps you all right
Oh, you can break me down if it takes all your might
Because I'm so much more
Than meets the eye

And I'm the one you can never trust
Because wounds are ways to reveal us
And yeah, I could have tried
And devoted my life to both of us
But what a waste of my time
When the world we have is yours

[Chorus]
So break me down if it makes you feel right
And hate me now if it keeps you all right
Oh, you can break me down if it takes all your might
Because I'm so much more
Than all your lies

Hate me, break me down
So break me down, down
So break me down

And hate me now if it keeps you all right

Time to lay claim to the evidence
Fingerprints sold me out
But our footprints washed away from the docks downtown
It's been getting late for days
And I think myself deserving of a little time off
We can kick it, hang for hours
And just mouth off about the world
And how we know it's going straight to hell

Pass me another bottle, honey
The Jager's so sweet
But if it keeps you around then I'm down

Meet me on Thames Street
I'll take you out though I'm hardly worth your time
In the cold you look so fierce, but I'm warm enough
Because the tension's like a fire
We'll hit South Broadway in a matter of minutes
And like a bad movie, I'll drop a line
Fall in the grave I've been digging myself
But there's room for two
Six feet under the stars

[Verse 2]
I should have known better than to call you out
(On a night like this, a night like this)
If not for you, I know I'd tear this place to the ground
(But I'm alright like this, alright like this)
I'm gonna roll the dice before you sober up and get gone

I'll take you out though I'm hardly worth your time
In the cold you look so fierce, but I'm warm enough

Fall in the grave I've been digging myself
But there's room for two
Six feet under the stars

Time to lay claim to the evidence
Fingerprints sold me out
But our footprints washed away
I'm guilty, but I'm safe for one more day
Overdressed and underage (what a let down)
""Do you really need to see an ID?""
This is embarrassing as hell (what a let down)
But I can cover for it so well
When we're six feet under the stars

[Chorus]
Thames Street
I'll take you out though I'm hardly worth your time
In the cold you look so fierce, but I'm warm enough
Because the tension's like a fire
We'll hit South Broadway in a matter of minutes

Brian, top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder, are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

[Verse 2]
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours
She'll be saying, ""Use me, show me the jacuzzi""
I imagine that it's there on a plate, your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened to make 'em wait for a while
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire, you are the unforecasted storm

[Verse 3]
(Brian) Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying) You leave the other story standing
With your renditions and jokes, bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their thunder
Are you putting us under?

Well, see you later, innovator

In the end, we're all just chalk lines on the concrete
Drawn only to be washed away
For the time that I've been given

She had excuses and she chose to use them
She was the victim of unspeakable abuses
Her husband was violent, malicious, and distant
Her kids now belong to the state of Massachusetts

[Hook]
They've been taken away! Hey!
They've been taken away!

[Verse 2]
Billy was a bright one, Tommy's off his head
Mother loved them both the same, at least that's what she said
I don't predict the future, I don't care about the past
Send them both to DSS, now you've had your chance

[Chorus]
The poison stole your babies
The judges took your rights
You can have your children... or the night!

[Verse 3]
I suppose you've been a victim, I suspect you may have lied
Have you lost all ambition, won't you give this thing a try
If you can't and you fail, you won't be the only loser
These kids don't stand a chance with you in their future

They've been taken away! (Hey!)

Where everything's nothing without you
I'd wait here forever just to, to see you smile
'Cause it's true, I am nothing without you

Through it all, I've made my mistakes
I stumble and fall, but I mean these words

And pieces of memories fall to the ground

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

[Chorus 1]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging 'till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had

The punchline before they have told the joke

Well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist

[Verse 1]
I've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

[Chorus]
Someone like you

[Verse 2]
Off in the night, while you live it up I'm off to sleep
Wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me

[Verse 1]
It kills me not to know this
But I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were
And her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down
A single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face
That this world has forgotten

[Verse 2]
There is no reconciliation
That will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present
To drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true
When I'm constantly failing you
Like walls that we just can't break through
Until we disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

[Chorus]
That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!"" (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, ""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!""
Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!

[Verse 3]
And the day pressed on like crushing weights
For no man does it ever wait
Like memories of dying days
That deafen us like hurricanes
Bathed in flames we held the brand
Uncurled the fingers in your hand
Pressed into the flesh like sand
Now do you understand?

[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

[Chorus]
That's when she said, ""I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!"" (Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, ""I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!""
Whoh-oh-oh, Whoh-oh-oh!

[Bridge]
One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say
But so much left that I don't know
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise
It takes me under, it takes me under once again...

I don't hate you...
I don't hate you, no...

[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? ’Cause I don't know

Show me how to lie, you're getting better all the time
And turning all against the one is an art that's hard to teach
Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
And as you step back into line, a mob jumps to their feet

Now dance, fucker, dance man, he never had a chance
And no one even knew it was really only you
And now you steal away, take him out today
Nice work you did, you're gonna go far, kid

With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives

[Verse 2]
Slowly out of line, and drifting closer in your sight
So play it out, I'm wide-awake, it's a scene about me
There's something in your way and now someone is gonna pay
And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now dance, fucker, dance, man, I never had a chance
And no one even knew, it was really only you
And now you'll lead the way, show the light of day

I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me lovin' all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current's only pulling me down
It’s getting harder to breathe
It won’t be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?

There's a fear in me, it’s not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won’t go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take them away
Oh, but I'm taking them back
'Cause all of this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live, it's not what we have
It's what we believe in

You make me wanna run around pulling my guns out and shit
You're tempting me to run my mouth and call you out on this, bitch
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this?
You need to slit your wrists, get pissed, and go jump off a bridge
What, you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What, you think I just got lucky, didn't work for this shit?
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
I've played a million empty shows to only family and friends
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big?
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kid's lips

We killed him then we stuffed his body in the Cadillac
B-But you always press and you know I never stress
With Loki DMS, J-Johnny to my left
Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west
I grew up on drive-bys and LA gang signs

[Verse 1]
Devon won't go to heaven
She's just another lost soul about to be mine again
Leave her, we will receive her
It is beyond your control will you ever meet again
Devon, one of eleven
Who had been rendered unwhole as a little child
She was taken and then forsaken
You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again

[Pre-Chorus]
Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal

[Chorus]
Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her

[Verse 2]
Sever, now and forever
You're just another lost soul about to be mine again
See her, you'll never free her
You must surrender it all if you'd like to meet again
Fire for your desire
As she begins to turn cold for the final time
You will shiver, 'til you deliver
You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again

[Pre-Chorus]
Devon lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal

[Chorus]
Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her

Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way

Wait, wait a minute take a step back
You gotta think twice before you react
So stay, stay a little while
'Cause a promise not kept is the road to exile
Hey! What's the circumstance
You'll never be great without taking a chance so
Wait, you waited too long
Had your hands in your pocket
When you shoulda been gone

So long to the regret
And now I see the world through diamond eyes

Damn! Damn it all down
Took one to the chest without even a sound
So... What! What are you worth?

Lips that need no introduction

Your drab eyes seem to invite

Everyone in this town
Is seeing somebody else
Everybody's tired of someone
Our eyes wander for help

Beyond the boundaries of your city's lights
Stand the heroes waiting for your cries

From the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered

When they're starving for a meal to eat

[Verse 1]
My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
(What if, what if?)

[Chorus 1]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have?
(What if, what if?)
If today was your last day
(What if, what if?)
(If today was your last day)

[Verse 2]
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
(What if, what if?)

[Chorus 2]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)
If today was your last day

[Bridge]
If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (Takes)
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

[Chorus 2]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (What if, what if?)

Another mission, the powers have called me away
Another time to carry the colors again

Another reason, another cause for me to fight
Another fuse uncovered now for me to light
My dedication to all that I've sworn to protect

Gets me tipsy, drink fast and enjoy your buzz
Take back streets to avoid the fuzz

Drunken pussy's what I'm thinking
I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance
Grab two hoes and do some body shots
I wanna party all night till they call the cops
Fuck a wristband, let's all do keg stand

[Verse 1]
Lips bleed from the rings
All these little bruises
The little things
That provoke the segregation
Lead the separation
Cage and clip the wings
Little noises
The little screams
That's not the operation
Conscious amputation

[Chorus]
Just do what you do what you do
What you did to me
Now I'm stuck in between a rock and nowhere
With nothing, with no one
Just do what you do what you do
What you've done to me
Draw the chalk line around the scene, it's over
Now it's all over

[Verse 2]
Broken heart that's lost its beat
A little boy, that softly weeps
Overwhelmed with emotion
Views burns through explosion
Lost the forest through the trees
Little whispers, the little dreams
That sparked the recollection
Constant suffocation

[Chorus]
Just do what you do what you do
What you did to me
Now I'm stuck in between a rock and nowhere
With nothing, with no one
Just do what you do what you do
What you've done to me
Draw the chalk line around the scene, it's over
Now it's all over

[Bridge]
I can feel my life is changing (Changing)
I can feel my heart is jaded (Jaded)
Left the sticks, left the stones
Words don't hurt, mend the bones
I can feel my life is changing

[Chorus]
Just do what you do what you do
What you did to me
Now I'm stuck in between a rock and nowhere
With nothing, with no one
Just do what you do what you do
What you've done to me
Draw the chalk line around the scene, it's over
Now it's all over

[Verse 3]
Raise the past and leave the pain
Cleanse the wounds and forget the name
Lost the will, ran far away
So it's all over
Spread the ash and fill the grave
Lost the tongue and make my way
Do what you do and go away
Now it's all over

[Verse 1]
What has come over me?
What madness taken hold of my heart
To run away, the only answer
Pulling me away to fall upon (the night)
The source of my recovery
Sweet shadow taking hold of the light
Another day has been devoured
Calling me away, bringing a question: Why?

[Pre-Chorus]
For saving me from all they’ve taken
Let my honor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over

[Chorus]
Now, on a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night!
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night

[Verse 2]
This self-discovery
Redemption taking hold of my mind
A serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away to feast upon (the night)
The source of my felicity
Dark maiden taking hold of my hand
Lead me away, from hibernation
Strong and unafraid, never a question why

For saving me from all they’ve taken
Let my honor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over

Now, on a path to take it all away

[Verse 1]
They say that we ain't got the style, we ain't got the class
We ain't got the tunes that's gonna put us on the map
And I'm a phony in disguise, tryna make the radio
I'm an antisocial anarchist who sound like so-and-so
They say I'm just a stupid kid, another crazy radical
Rock 'n' roll is dead, I probably should have stayed at school
Another Generation X who somehow slipped up through the cracks
Oh, they'd love to see me fall, but I'm already on my back

[Chorus]
So it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

[Verse 2]
Now I know I'm not a saint, I've been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws, I'd rather keep them in the light
They want to criticize, scrutinize, cast another stone
Burn me at the stake and sit and watch it from their throne
They say the devil is my pal, I do a lot of drugs
The crowd will only like me if they're really fucking drunk
They think they know my thoughts, but they don't know the least
If they'd listen to the words they'd find a message tucked beneath

[Chorus]
But it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit even though they never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

[Bridge]
You hear that? You hear what's coming?
Oh, you better run for the hills
Cause we're coming to your town
And we're gonna burn that motherfucker down

[Verse 3]
Here's the moral to the story: we don't do it for the glory
We don't do it for the money, we don't do it for the fame
So all the critics who despise us, go ahead and criticize us
It's your tyranny that drives us, adds the fire to our flames

[Outro]
And it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit so you know we never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
I'm only playing music cause you know I fucking love it
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes

Than he gave, she's looking for

He doesn't want her out there and alone now
He knows she's moving it, knows she's using it
Now he's losing it, she don't care

Stop what you're doing, you don't want to ruin
The chance that you got to find a new one

Till there's nothing left in her
Let's watch this city burn the world

[Verse 1: Charlie Scene]
My body doused in ash
With two empty cans of gas
The only evidence they have
Is a police sketch of my mask
And it's hard at times to ask
If you can save my heart for last
And it's hard to face the facts
When the darkness fades to black
It's not just make-believe
When they make me take a seat
And they put amphetamines
In the air and make me breathe
So, come on and grab your children
Look out for burning buildings
And villains who pillage
They're killin' by the millions
And billions of people die for a lost cause
So now I pray to my nation destroyed under God

The city looks so pretty
Do you wanna burn it with me?
Till the skies bleed ashes
And the fucking skyline crashes
They catch us with matches, ignite the flame
And all the hopes of a youth deemed fucking insane
They say, ""Take the pill, in God we trust
Go and kill, God loves us
As in life, as in death
Breathing till there is no breath""
I will not die in the night, but in the light of the sun
With the ashes of this world in my lungs
But who am I to say?
Let's all just run away
Grab your saints and pray
And we'll burn this world today

Do you wanna burn it with me?

Do you wanna burn it with me?

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins

And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

Oh, oh

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame

Ooh my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know

Well what would you say
If I said that you could?
Just carry this gun

Black leather boots
Spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair
But it looks alright
We marched and we sang
We all became friends
As we learned how to fight

[Hook]
A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

[Verse 2]
I kicked in the door
I yelled my commands
The children, they cried
But I got my man
We took him away
A bag over his face
From his family and his friends
They took off his clothes
They pissed in his hands
I told them to stop
But then I joined in
We beat him with guns
And batons not just once
But again and again

[Hook]
A hero of war
Yeah, that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
'Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

She walked
Through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop
I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
So I lifted my gun
And I fired away
And the shells jumped trough the smoke
And into the sand
That the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

[Chorus]
A hero of war
Is that what they see?
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
It's the only flag I trust

[Refrain]
He said, ""Son
Have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say
If I said that you could?""

[Verse 1]
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
You would just sail on

[Chorus]
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

[Verse 2]
These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This seeking life outside its hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground, like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with the ship
Fading in the shadows
Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

[Chorus]
How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?

Tonight, I'll have a look and try to find my face again
Buried beneath this house, my spirit screams and dies again
Out back, a monster wears a cloak of Persian leather
Behind the TV screen, I've fallen to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away, I need to get away

[Verse 2]
Blanket of silence makes me want to sink my teeth in deep
Burn all the evidence of fabricated disbelief
Pull back the curtains, took a look into your eyes
My tongue has now become a platform for your lies

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
I want to get away, I need to get away

[Chorus]
Now you know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall
Oh God, I ain't got no other place to hide
Chained down, like a sitting duck just waiting for the fall
You know, yeah, you've got my back against the wall

[Verse 3]
Deep in the jungle, camouflaged by all the fallen leaves
A hand holds up the sky while, shamefully, I make my plea
The altar's calling, but my legs won't seem to stand
Guess I'm a coward scared to face the man I am

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, you've got me where you want me again and I can't turn away
I'm hanging by a thread and I'm feeling like I'll fall
I'm stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday

[Verse 1]
It's been eighteen days
Since I'd look at myself
I don't wanna have to change
If I don't then no one will
Is it my state of mind
Or is it just everything else?
I don't wanna have to be here
I don't understand it now

[Chorus]
'Cause its been eighteen days
Since I first held you
But to me it feels just like
It feels like a lifetime
I'm trying hard to re-arrange
Some say it's the hardest thing to do
But that's another eighteen days
Without you

[Verse 2]
Time after time
I've been through this
You show me what it means to live
You give me hope when I was hopeless
As my days fade to night
I remember that state of mind
I'm soaring straight into your heart
And I'll fly high

[Chorus]
'Cause it's been eighteen days
Since I first held you
But to me it feels just like
It feels like a lifetime

Some say it's the hardest thing to do
But that's just too many days
Without you

And I know what they say
About all good things
Will they come to an end?
But I'll fight this time
So that we might
Have a chance at this

[Verse 1]
Put me in a special school because I am such a fool
And I don't need a single book to teach me how to read
Who needs stupid books? They are for petty crooks
And I will learn by studying the lessons in my dreams
So turn off the TV, 'cause that's what others see
And movies are as bad as eating chocolate ice-cream
They only sicken me, don't let me play football
I'll sack the quarterback and jack the brother of the ball

[Chorus]
I'm a troublemaker, never been a faker
Doing things my own way and never giving up
I'm a troublemaker, not a double-taker
I don't have the patience to keep it on the up

[Verse 2]
I picked up a guitar, what does this signify?
I'm going to play some heavy metal riffs and you will die
You wanted arts and crafts? How's this for arts and crafts?
Wanannanananananananananananananana, that's right!
I'm growing out my hair, I'm moving out to Cherokee
I'm going to be a rock star and you are going to bear with me
Because I can't work a job like any other slob
Punching in and punching out and sucking up to Bob
Marrying a beeyotch, having seven keeyods
Giving up and growing old and hoping there's a God

[Chorus]
I'm a troublemaker, never been a faker
Doing things my own way and never giving up
I'm a troublemaker, not a double-taker
I don't have the patience to keep it on the up

[Verse 3]
I'm going to be a star and people will crane necks
To get a glimpse of me and see if I am having sex
And studying my moves, they try to understand
Why I am so unlike the singers in the other bands
I'm such a mystery as anyone can see
There isn't anybody else exactly quite like me
And when it's party time, like 1999
I'll party by myself because I'm such a special guy

[Chorus]
I'm a troublemaker, never been a faker
Doing things my own way and never giving up
I'm a troublemaker, not a double-taker
I don't have the patience to keep it on the up

Keep it on the up, I'm a troublemaker
Keep it on the up, I'm a troublemaker
Keep it on the up, I'm a troublemaker, never giving up

Hate, see? It saved me, and these tears are deadly
You feel that? I'd rip back every time you tried to steal that
You feel bad? You feel sad? I'm sorry, hell no, fuck that
It was my heart, it was my life, it was my start, it was your knife
This strife, it dies, this life and these lies
And these lungs have sung this song for too long
And it's true, I hurt to remember I loved you

And I've lost it all, fell today, it's all the same

And I've been abused, I feel so used because of you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no

I wish I could've quit you, I wish I never missed you
And told you that I loved you every time I fucked you
The future that we both drew and all the shit we've been through
Obsessed with the thought of you, the pain just grew and grew
How could you do this to me? Look at what I made for you
It never was enough, and the world is what I gave to you
I used to be love-struck, now I'm just fucked up
Pull up my sleeve and see the pattern of my cuts

[Chorus: Deuce]
And I've lost it all, fell today, it’s all the same
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no
And I've been abused, I feel so used because of you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry, no

Seems like all we had is over now
You left to rest
And your tears are dried up now
You just lay without a sound
Seems like all we had is over now
You left to rest
And my fears are over now
I can leave with my head down

And I've lost it all, fell today, it’s all the same

It was me in this world and a broken dream
I was blamin' myself for all that was goin' wrong
I was way out there, on the wrong side of town
And the ones that I loved, I started pushing them out
Then I realized that it was all my fault

For what seems like a lifetime
I'm drowning in the pain
I'm breaking down again

We tore down the walls I built around myself
I was struck by the light, and I fell to the ground

I've been lookin' for a lifeline

I'm drowning in the pain
I'm breaking down again

Is there anybody out there?
Can you pull me from this ocean of despair?
I'm drowning in the pain, breaking down again
Lookin' for a lifeline

You know a heart of gold won't take you all the way
And in a world so cold, it's hard to keep the faith
I'm never gonna fade away

I've been lookin' for a lifeline (looking for a lifeline)
For what seems like a lifetime (seems like a lifetime)

Coiled up on the dirty ground

Or the wolf's gonna blow it down

If it's not real
You can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true
Then you can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah

[Verse 1]
Define your meanin' of war
To me it's what we do when we're bored
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
And it makes me want it more
Because I'm hyped up, out of control
If it's a fight, I'm ready to go
I wouldn't put my money on the other guy
If you know what I know that I know

[Chorus]
It's been a long time comin'
And the tables turned around
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin'
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down

[Verse 2]
Define your meanin' of fun
Is it fuckin', druggin' or guns?
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
So get ready for another one
Let's take a trip down memory lane
The words circlin' in my brain
You can treat this like another all the same
But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain

[Chorus]
It's been a long time comin'
And the tables turned around
'Cause one of us is going
One of us is goin' down

It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'

This is hardly worth fightin' for
But it's the little petty shit that I can't ignore
When my fist hits your face and your face hits the floor
It'll be a long time comin'
But you got the message now
'Cause I was never goin'
Yeah, you're the one that's goin' down

Among the broken mirrors I don’t look the same

And everyone I've loved before
Flashed before my eyes
And nothing mattered anymore
I looked into the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I wanted something better man
I wished for something new
And I wanted something beautiful
And wish for something true
Been looking for a reason man
Something to lose

[Chorus]
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)

[Verse 3]
Know your head is spinning
Broken hearts will mend
This is our beginning
Coming to an end

[Pre-Chorus]
Well you wanted something better man
You wished for something new
Well you wanted something beautiful
You wished for something true
Been looking for a reason man
Something to lose

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)

[Verse 1]
Search for the answers I knew all along
I lost myself
We all fall down
Never the wiser of what I've become
Alone, I stand
A broken man

All I have is one last chance
I won't turn my back on you
Take my hand
Drag me down
If you fall, then I will, too
And I can't save what's left of you

[Chorus]
Sing something new
I have nothing left
I can't face the dark without you
There's nothing left to lose
The fight never ends
I can't face the dark without you

[Verse 2]
Swallow me under and pull me apart
I understand, there's nothing left
Pain so familiar and close to the heart
No more, no less; I won't forget
Come back down, save yourself
I can't find my way to you
And I can't bear to face the truth

[Chorus]
Sing something new
I have nothing left
I can't face the dark without you
There's nothing left to lose
The fight never ends
I can't face the dark without you

[Bridge]
I wanted to forgive
I'm trying to forget
Don't leave me here again
I am with you forever, the end

Sing something new
I have nothing left
I can't face the dark without you
There's nothing left to lose
The fight never ends
I can't face the dark without you

Holding the hand that holds me down
I forgive you, forget you, the end

Holding the hand that holds me down
I forgive you, forget you, the end

[Verse 1]
Manage me, I'm a mess
Turn a page, I'm a book half unread
I wanna be laughed at, laughed with, just because
I wanna feel weightless and that should be enough
But I'm stuck in this fucking rut
Waiting on a second-hand pick-me-up
And I'm over
Getting older

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could just find the time
Then I would never let another day go by
I'm over
Getting old

[Chorus]
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear
'Cause I've been going crazy
I don't want to waste another minute here

[Verse 2]
Make believe that I impress
That every word by design turns a head
I wanna feel reckless, I wanna live it up, just because
I wanna feel weightless, 'cause that would be enough

This could be all I've waited for

And this could be everything
I don't wanna dream anymore
Maybe it's not my weekend
But it's gonna be my year
And I've been going crazy
I'm stuck in here

[Chorus]
Maybe it's not my weekend

And I'm so sick of watching
While the minutes pass as I go nowhere
And this is my reaction
To everything I fear

Well how's your view of things today?
Got up young to fade away
The sinners sin but aren't aware
Our fables take us everywhere
I can't keep up with you
I can't keep up

I can't compete with history
We'll film it live but dub our tale
The mystery must stay inside
Look at our homes, look at our lives
In control of the morning
In control of the sea

You are creating all the bubbles at night
I'm chasing round trying to pop them all the time

There's a girl, there's a girl
And she's down by the river
In her own creepy world
There's a girl, there's a girl
And she's down by the river
It's time to consider
That baby is a sinner
She'll wash away your sins (wash away your sins)
She'll wash away your sins (wash away your sins)
She'll wash away your sins and go home

I only once upset my kin
Accused him of a moral slip
He came back and claimed a change
I know his life's the same again
I can't ask him again

They know what everybody knows
Better sit a letter from a thief says
Why lead when everybody sleeps
So few ways to cover up your wounds
Lost in a finger forced to lie
This sends us medicating through it all

If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all
Stay there

Faceless, so little there to judge
Left wing, let's separate the cold out
Opposites, we never need to tell
One sting I've found I'm having to, I'm having to

Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all
Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all

Solitude, waste of a man
This fades as soon as the sun sets

I now own this fatal role that lives
Imagine here's a better feel
Told to dissolve, or choose to fade
Or stay here, you'll live

Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all
Stay there, you'll live

If you ever enter my mind

I've fought it for a long time now
While drowning in a river of denial
I washed up, fixed up, picked up all my broken things
'Cause you left me; Police-tape, chalk-line
Tequila shots in the dark scene of the crime
Suburban living with a feeling that I'm giving up
Everything for you

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh-oh-over me?
I think that I should go (Go)
And something's telling me to leave but I won't
'Cause I'm damned if I do ya, damned if I don't

[Verse 2]
It took a lot to take you home
One stupid call and I end up alone
You're made up, dressed up, messed up plans I set in stone
But you made me do when I don't, like
Dancing in the alley with the street-rat night-life
Can't keep living with a feeling that I'm giving up everything for you

Oh-oh-oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh-oh-over me?
I think that I should go (Go)
And something's telling me to leave but I won't

Make a fool of myself when you hang around
When you're gone, I'm a match that's burning out

Oh-oh-oh, how was I supposed to know
That you were oh-oh-over me?

It never took a fool to see the things that I won't

Hiding under the bed, in my body, in my head

631,You Found Me,The Fray,The Fray,2009-02-02,241853,73,"

I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""
Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by a telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Verse 2]
In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

For early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never send me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

To find me? To find me?

I was born of the womb of a poisonous man
Beaten and broken and chased from the land

The branches, the bones of the liars and thieves
Rise up above it, high up above and see

Pray to your god, open your heart
Whatever you do, don't be afraid of the dark
Cover your eyes, the devil's inside

642,Sometime Around Midnight,The Airborne Toxic Event (Deluxe Edition),The Airborne Toxic Event,2009-01-01,303586,56,"

And it starts sometime around midnight
Or at least that's when you lose yourself for a minute or two
As you stand under the bar lights
And the band plays some song
About forgetting yourself for a while
And the piano's this melancholy soundtrack to her smile
And that white dress she's wearing
You haven't seen her for a while

But you know that she's watching
She's laughing, she's turning
She's holding her tonic like a crux
The room's suddenly spinning
She walks up and asks how you are
So you can smell her perfume
You can see her lying naked in your arms

And so there's a change in your emotions
And all these memories come rushing
Like feral waves to your mind
Of the curl of your bodies like two perfect circles entwined
And you feel hopeless and homeless
And lost in the haze of the wine

Then she leaves with someone you don't know
But she makes sure you saw her
She looks right at you and bolts
As she walks out the door
Your blood boiling, your stomach in ropes
Oh, and your friends say ""What is it?
You look like you've seen a ghost""

Then you walk under the streetlights
And you're too drunk to notice that everyone's staring at you
You just don't care what you look like
The world is falling around you

You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You just have to see her

I always knew that you'd come back to get me
And you always knew that it wouldn't be easy
To go back to the start to see where it all began
Or end up at the bottom to watch how it all ends

[Pre-Chorus]
You tried to lie and say I was everything
I remember when I said, ""I'm nothing without you, I'm nothing without you""

[Chorus]
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you

[Verse 2]
You always thought that I left myself open
But you didn't know I was already broken
I told myself that it wouldn't be so bad
But pulling away you took everything I had

[Pre-Chorus]
You tried to lie and say I was everything
I remember when I said, ""I'm nothing without you, I'm nothing without you""

Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind I'll get lost if you want me to

I see it all in you
Now every day I find myself saying
""I want to get lost in you, I'm nothing without you""

Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind I'll get lost if you want me to

[Verse 1]
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 2]
'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 3]
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

[Chorus 2]
So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

[Chorus/Outro]
And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place?
Is this our last embrace?
Or will the walls start caving in?

It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right
It could be wrong, could be....

Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

Just to see you smile again
Kill your prayers for love and peace
You'll wake the thought police

Born on the 4th of July

The scars on my hands and a means to an end
It's all that I have to show

You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, ""You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

[Chorus]
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are

[Verse 1]
I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kinda boring
Need something that I can confess
'Til all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so

[Chorus]
So tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away

My God, amazing how we got this far
It's like we're chasing all those stars
Who's driving shiny big black cars
And every day I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Send it straight to gold
But I don't really like my flow, no

So tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
I'm sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away

Live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train

Love in technicolor, sprayed out on walls
Well I've been pounding at the pavement
'Til there's nothing at all
I got my cloak and dagger
In a bar room brawl
See the local loves a fighter
Loves a winner to fall

I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
Seems like it's time to begin

He stays home from work this time
He never really told his wife
He never really told a lie

Oh, we blame it on the times

She's a rainbow, and she loves the peaceful life
Knows I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight
There's a part of me in the chaos that's quiet

Everybody needs to cry or needs to spit
Every sweet tooth needs just a little hit
Every beauty needs to go out with an idiot
How can you stand next to the truth and not see it?

Every generation gets a chance to change the world
Pity the nation that won't listen to your boys and girls

Oh, but a change of heart comes slow

It's not a hill, it's a mountain
As you start out the climb
Listen for me, I'll be shouting
That we're gonna make it all the way to the light
But I know I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby, I know I'm not alone
Baby, baby, baby, I know I'm not alone
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
It's not a hill, it's a mountain
As we start out the climb
Listen for me, I'll be shouting
Shouting to the darkness, squeeze out sparks of light

[Post-Chorus]
You know we're gonna go crazy
You know we'll go crazy
You know we'll go crazy if we don't go crazy tonight

[Outro]
Oh, slowly now
Oh, always slow

[Verse 1]
The looking glass, so shiny and new
How quickly the glamour fades
I start spinning, slipping out of time
Was that the wrong pill to take? (Raise it up)

You made a deal, and now it seems you have to offer up
But will it ever be enough? (Raise it up, raise it up)
It's not enough (Raise it up, raise it up)

Here I am, a rabbit-hearted girl
Frozen in the headlights
It seems I've made the final sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
We raise it up, this offering
We raise it up

[Chorus]
This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

[Verse 2]
I look around, but I can't find you (raise it up)
If only I could see your face (raise it up)
I start rushing towards the skyline (raise it up)
I wish that I could just be brave

I must become a lion-hearted girl
Ready for a fight
Before I make the final sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
We raise it up, this offering
We raise it up

[Chorus]
This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

[Bridge]
Raise it up, raise it up
Raise it up, raise it up
And in the spring I shed my skin
And it blows away with the changing wind
The waters turn from blue to red
As towards the sky I offer it

[Chorus]
This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

[Chorus]
This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

[Chorus]
This is a gift, it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife?
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight

[Outro]
This is a gift

[Verse 1]
Yes I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Oh I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah others they've got none
Stay with me...
Let's just breathe...

[Verse 2]
Practiced all my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
Yeah I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed
Stay with me
You're all I see...

[Chorus]
Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me

[Verse 3]
As I come clean...
I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Everything you gave and nothing you would take, oh no
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave...

[Chorus]
Did I say that I need you?
Oh, did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean, ah...

Nothing you would take
Everything you gave
Hold me til I die
Meet you on the other side...

Verse 1:
I'm running out of ways to make you see
I want you to stay here beside me
I won't be okay and I won't pretend I am
So just tell me today and take my hand
Please take my hand
Please take my hand

It's so simple and you know it is
You know it is

All our lives
You're the only way to me

For God's sake, dear
For God's sake, dear
For God's sake, dear
For God's sake, dear
For God's sake, dear

It's not a test, nor a trick of the mind

Cause I'm aching, I know you are too
For the touch of your warm skin
As I breathe you in

679,Lisztomania,Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix,Phoenix,2009,241546,64,"

[Verse 1]
So sentimental
Not sentimental, no
Romantic, not disgusting yet
Darling, I'm down and lonely
When with the fortunate only
I've been looking for something else
Do let, do let, do let
Jugulate, do let, do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
Distant from other interests
On your favorite weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
That's with the fortunate only
No, I gotta be someone else
These days, it comes, it comes, it comes
It comes, it comes and goes

[Chorus]
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Not hard to let it go
From a mess to the masses

[Verse 2]
Follow, misguide, stand still
Disgust, discourage
On this precious weekend ending
This love's for gentlemen only
Wealthiest gentlemen only
And now that you're lonely
Do let, do let, do let
Jugulate, do let, do
Let's go slowly, discouraged
We'll burn the pictures instead
When it's all over, we can barely discuss
For one minute only
Not with the fortunate only
Thought it could have been something else
These days, it comes, it comes, it comes
It comes, it comes and goes

[Chorus]
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Know how to let it go
From a mess to the masses
Lisztomania
Think less but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Not easily offended
Know how to let it go
From a mess to the masses

[Bridge]
Ooh, this is showtime, this is showtime, this is showtime
Ooh, this is showtime, this is showtime, this is showtime
Time, time to show it off, time to show it off
It's time to show it off
Time, time to show it off, time to show it off
It's time to show it off

[Chorus]
From the mess to the masses
Lisztomania
Think less, but see it grow
Like a riot, like a riot, oh
Disgust, disgust, disgust, disgust, disgust, discouraged

[Verse 1]
Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you

[Pre-Chorus]
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A moment, a love, a dream aloud

[Chorus]
So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Songs of desperation
I played them for you

A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A moment, a love, a dream aloud

A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
Won't stop 'til it's over

[Verse 1]
I thought I saw you in the Battleship
But it was only a look-a-like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

[Verse 2]
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
""Please, can I call you her name?""

[Chorus]
And I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

[Verse 3]
I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
""No, you can't call me her name""

[Bridge]
Tell me, where's your hiding place?
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

[Chorus]
I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

[Verse 4]
I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
She was close, well, you couldn't get much closer
She said, ""I'm really not supposed to, but yes
You can call me anything you want""

Well I sit and hear sentimental footsteps
Then a voice say,""Hi, so
So whatcha got, whatcha got this time?
C'mon, let's get high
C'mon Lexo, whatcha got next-o?
Walk 25 miles, oh
Well I'm bored, I'm bored

Well, I found a new way

C'mon, don't amuse me
I don't need your sympathy
La, la-la-la-la

I found a new way
I found a new way, baby

Am I Ulysses? Am I Ulysses?
""No, but you are now, boy
So sinister, so sinister
But last night was wild
What's the matter, there?
Feelin' kind of anxious
That hot blood grew cold
Yeah, everyone, everybody knows it
Yeah, everyone, everybody knows it
Everybody knows ah...""

I was born to be with you
In this space and time
After that and ever after I haven't had a clue
Only to break rhyme
This foolishness can leave a heart black and blue

Only love, only love can leave such a mark
But only love, only love can heal such a scar

I was born to sing for you
I didn't have a choice but to lift you up
And sing whatever song you wanted me to
I give you back my voice
From the womb my first cry, it was a joyful noise ...
