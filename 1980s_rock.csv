1,Don't Stand So Close To Me,Zenyatta Mondatta (Remastered 2003),The Police,1980-10-03,242666,68,"

[Verse 1]
Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Bookmarking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

[Chorus]
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

[Verse 2]
Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry

[Chorus]
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

[Verse 3]
Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in
That book by Nabokov

[Chorus]
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

[Outro]
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

[Verse 1]
A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, ""You and me babe, how about it?""
Juliet says, ""Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gimme a heart attack""
He's underneath the window
She's singing, ""Hey la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway, what ya gonna do about it?""

[Chorus 1]
""Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, when you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget
The movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet""

[Bridge]
Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?

[Verse 2]
Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything
You promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say, ""Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him""

[Chorus 2]
""Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us
(You know the movie song)
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet""

[Verse 3]
""I can't do the talk like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you
And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and the bad company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time""

[Chorus 2]
""Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us

When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Juliet""

[Outro]
And a lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, ""You and me babe, how about it?""
""You and me babe, how about it?""

Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing

Everybody's got a hungry heart

[Verse 1]
Begin the day with a friendly voice
A companion unobtrusive
Plays that song that's so elusive
And the magic music makes your morning mood

[Verse 2]
Off on your way, hit the open road
There is magic at your fingers
For the spirit ever lingers
Undemanding contact in your happy solitude

[Chorus]
Invisible airwaves crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free

[Verse 3]
All this machinery making modern music
Can still be open-hearted
Not so coldly charted
It's really just a question of your honesty
Yeah, your honesty
One likes to believe in the freedom of music
But glittering prizes
And endless compromises
Shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah

[Chorus]
Invisible airwaves crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on a timeless wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
For the words of the profits
Were written on the studio wall
Concert hall
And echoes with the sound
Of salesmen
Of salesmen
Of salesmen!

[Verse 1]
Don't think me unkind
Words are hard to find
They're only cheques I've left unsigned
From the banks of chaos in my mind
And when their eloquence escapes me
Their logic ties me up and rapes me

[Chorus]
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

[Verse 2]
Poets, priests, and politicians
Have words to thank for their positions
Words that scream for your submission
And no one's jamming their transmission
Because when their eloquence escapes you
Their logic ties you up and rapes you

[Chorus]
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you

You should've seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was something missing
You should've known by the tone of my voice, maybe
But you didn't listen
You played dead
But you never bled

All coiled up and hissing

And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us, baby, way before them
And we're still together

What's the matter with
The clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some
Old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been
Hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy
Till you spend a lot of money

Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 2]
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set
Of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise
The miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true
Baby blue Continental

[Chorus]
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

[Bridge]
Oh, it doesn't matter
What they say in the papers
Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

[Verse 4]
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money
On a new set of speakers
You get more mileage
From a cheap pair of sneakers

Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 5]
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much

The new fashion honey?
All you need are looks
And a whole lotta money

I seen a girl on a one-way corridor
Stealing down a wrong-way street

She had wheels on, on her feet
Well, the cars do the usual dances
Same old cruise and the kerbside crawl
But the rollergirl, she's taking chances
They just love to see her take them all

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
And the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was
Rollergirl, don't worry
D.J. play the movies all night long, all night long

[Verse 3]
She tortures taxi drivers just for fun
She like to read their lips
Says, ""Toro, toro, taxi, see you tomorrow, my son""
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip
She got her own world in the city
You can't intrude on her, no, no, no
She got her own world in the city
Because the city's been so rude to her

[Pre-Chorus]
No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

[Chorus]
She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
But the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was

Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me, oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

[Verse 3: Bob Seger]
And the years rolled slowly past, and I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
Found myself further and further from my home and I

[Verse 4: Bob Seger]
I guess I lost my way, there were oh so many roads
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live
Never worried about payin' or even how much I owe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Bob Seger]
Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

[Chorus 2: Bob Seger]
Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

[Piano Solo]
2:36 - 3:19

[Pre-Chorus 3: Bob Seger]
Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

[Chorus 3: Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band]
Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
I'm older now but still running against the wind

[Outro: Bob Seger & (The Silver Bullet Band)]
Well, I'm older now and still running
Against the wind

[Instrumental Intro: ""The Carousel Waltz""]

[Verse 1]
Getting crazy on the waltzers
But it's the life that I choose
Hey, sing about the sixblade, sing about the switchback And a torture tattoo
And I've been riding on a ghost train
Where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight
But I'd always tell you where I am
In a screaming ring of faces
I've seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races, yeah
Just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever
Said: ""Let it rock and let it roll""
I had the one arm bandit fever
There was an arrow through my heart and my soul

[Chorus 1]
And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah, love

[Verse 2]
It's just the danger, danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said: ""You are the perfect stranger""
She said: ""Baby, let's keep it like this""
It's just a cake walk, twisting baby, yeah, step right up and say:
""Hey Mister, give me two, give me two now, 'cos any two can play""

[Chorus 1]
And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Oh, love, love

[Bridge]
Well, it's been money for muscle on another whirligig
Money for muscle and another girl I dig
Another hustle just to, just to make it big
And rockaway, rockaway
Oh, rockaway, rockaway

[Chorus 2]
And girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Oh, like the Spanish City to me
When-a we were kids
Hey girl, it looks so pretty to me
Just like it always did
Oh, like the Spanish City to me
When-a we were kids

Check it out!

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
She took off a silver locket
She said: ""Remember me by this""
She put her hand in my pocket
I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel
I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough
But something must have made me stay

[Chorus 1]
And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah, love, love, love
On the tunnel of love
Oh, love, love

[Verse 4]
And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rockaway, rockaway
Rockaway, rockaway
From cullercoats and whitley bay
Out to rockaway

[Chorus 2]
And girl it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids
Girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids

[Verse 1]
Friday night, I crashed your party
Saturday, I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

[Verse 2]
I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

[Chorus]
You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

[Verse 3]
Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said, take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy
Some madness for a while

[Verse 4]
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

[Chorus]
You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

You may be wrong

Johnny's always running around
Trying to find certainty
He needs all the world to confirm
That he ain't lonely
Mary counts the walls
Knows he tires easily

Johnny thinks the world would be right
If it could buy truth from him
Mary says he changes his mind
More than a woman
But she made her bed
Even when the chance was slim

Johnny says he's willing to learn
When he decides he's a fool
Johnny says he'll live anywhere
When he earns time to
Mary combs her hair
Says she should be used to it

Mary always hedges her bets
She never knows what to think
She says that he still acts like he's
Being discovered
Scared that he'll be caught
Without a second thought
Running around

Johnny feels he's wasting his breath
Trying to talk sense to her
Mary says he's lacking a real
Sense of proportion
So she combs her hair
Knows he tires easily

Johnny's always running around
Trying to find certainty
He needs all the world to confirm
That he ain't lonely
Mary counts the walls
Says she should be used to it

A police car and a screaming siren
Pneumatic drill and ripped-up concrete
A baby wailing, a stray dog howling
The screech of brakes and lamplight blinking

That's entertainment

A smash of glass and the rumble of boots
An electric train and a ripped-up phone booth
Paint-splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat
Lights going out and a kick in the balls

I say that's entertainment
That's entertainment
La la la la la, ah
La la la la la, ah

Days of speed and slow-time Mondays
Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday
Watching the news and not eating your tea
A freezing cold flat with damp on the walls

I say that's entertainment
That's entertainment
La la la la la

Waking up at 6 A.M. on a cool warm morning
Opening the windows and breathing in petrol
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard
Watching the telly and thinking 'bout your holidays

La la la la la, ah

Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes
Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume
A hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were far away

Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight
Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude
Getting a cab and travelling on buses
Reading the grafitti about slashed-seat affairs

I come from down in the valley
Where, mister, when you're young
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school

And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride

Then I got Mary pregnant
And, man, that was all she wrote

We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest

No flowers, no wedding dress

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we did ride
Ah-yah

[Verse 3]
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well, mister, they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
And Mary acts like she don't care

[Bridge]
But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
Or is it something worse

[Chorus 3]
That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight
Ah-yah-yah
Down to the river
My baby and I
Oh, down to the river we ride
Ah-yah-ay

[Ad-libs]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Well, our hearts beat like thunder
I don't know why they don't explode
You got your hands in my back pockets
And Sam Cooke's singin' on the radio
You say that I'm the boy who can make it all come true
Well, I'm tellin' ya that I don't know if I know what to do

Well all night, all night
Well, it's time to go home
And I ain't even done with the night

Well, I don't know no good come-ons
And I don't know no cool lines

[Verse 1]
There are those who think
That life has nothing left to chance
A host of holy horrors
To direct our aimless dance

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A planet of playthings
We dance on the strings
Of powers we cannot perceive
The stars aren't aligned
Or the gods are malign
Blame is better to give than receive

[Chorus]
You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice
You can choose from phantom fears, and kindness that can kill
I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose free will

[Verse 2]
There are those who think
That they've been dealt a losing hand
The cards were stacked against them
They weren't born in Lotus land

[Pre-Chorus 2]
All preordained
A prisoner in chains
A victim of venomous fate
Kicked in the face
You can pray for a place
In heaven's unearthly estate

[Chorus]
You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice
You can choose from phantom fears, and kindness that can kill
I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose free will

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Each of us, a cell of awareness
Imperfect and incomplete
Genetic blends
With uncertain ends
On a fortune hunt that's far too fleet

[Chorus]
You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice
You can choose from phantom fears, and kindness that can kill
I will choose a path that's clear, I will choose free will

See into the trees

Come closer and see
See into the dark
Just follow your eyes

Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark
I hear her voice
And start to run
Into the trees
Into the trees

Into the trees

Suddenly I stop
But I know it's too late
I'm lost in a forest
All alone
The girl was never there
It's always the same
I'm running towards nothing
Again and again and again and again

Crack that whip
Give the past a slip
Step on a crack

Shape it up

Go forward
Move ahead
Try to detect it

To whip it
Whip it good

You must whip it
You will never live it down
Unless you whip it
No one gets away
Until they whip it

I say whip it
Whip it good

For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know
Doesn't really know

You can watch yourself
While you are eating

Window shopping
Find no interest
In the racks and shelves
Just ten thousand reflections
Of my own sweet self, self, self...

You're my mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom...

Recompense
For all my crimes
Of self defense
Queue as you whisper
Make no sense
Drift gently into
Mental illness

We are the people one and all
From deliverance to the fall
From the battle and the heat
To our triumph and defeat

We are the young ones crying out
Full of anger full of doubt
And we're breaking all of the rules
Never choosing to be fools

We are tired of being used
We are constantly excused
In the battle and the heat
In the shadow of retreat

We are the young ones crying out
Full of anger full of doubt
And we're breaking all of the rules
Never choosing to be fools

We are the people one and all
From deliverance to the fall
From the bitter to the brave
From the cradle to the grave

We are the young ones crying out
Full of anger full of doubt
And we're breaking all of the rules
Never choosing to be fools

A modern-day warrior
Mean, mean stride

Though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events
The river

Is what you say about society
Catch the mist
Catch the myth
Catch the mystery
Catch the drift

And the space he invades, he gets by on you

No, his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent

Catch the wit
Catch the spirit
Catch the spit

And the energy you trade

The friction of the day

I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying ""you better""
You better bet your life

You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now

[Verse 3]
I showed up late one night
With a neon light for a visa
But knowing I am so eager to fight
Can't make letting me in any easier (oooh ooh)
I know I've been wearing crazy clothes
And I look pretty crappy sometime (oooh ooh)
But my body feels so good
And I still sing a razor line every time
And when it comes to all night living
I know what I am giving
I have got it all down to a tee
And it's free

[Chorus]
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you scream you better (ooh)
You better you better you bet
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you scream you better
You better you better you bet

Come on!

Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Years go by
I'm looking through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold

[Verse 2]
Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes, we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it

Lonely is the night when you find yourself alone
Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own
Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call
You feel the time is right, say the writin's on the wall
It's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' in
Call it what you like it's time you got to win
Lonely, lonely, lonely your spirit's sinkin' down
You find you're not the only stranger in this town
Red lights, green lights, stop and go jive
Headlines, deadlines jammin' your mind
You been stealin' shots from the side
Let your feelin's go for a ride
There's danger out tonight, the man is on the prowl
Get the dynamite, the boys are set to howl
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call
Are you ready for a fight, do you wanna take it all?
Slowdown, showdown waitin' on line
Show time, no time for changin' your mind
Streets are ringin', march to the sound
Let your secrets follow you down
Somebody's watchin' you baby, so much you can do
Nobody's stoppin' you baby, from makin' it too
One glimpse'll show you now baby, what the music can do
One kiss'll show you now baby, it can happen to you
No more sleepin', wastin' our time
Midnight creepin's, first on our minds
No more lazin' 'round the TV
You'll go crazy, come out with me
Feelin' lonely
Lonely is the night
Feelin' lonely
Lonely is the night
Lonely, lonely, lonely

Living on a lighted stage
Approaches the unreal

In touch with some reality

Cast in this unlikely role
Ill-equipped to act
With insufficient tact
One must put up barriers
To keep oneself intact

That no one knows about

And hop the turbine freight
To far outside the wire
Where my white-haired uncle waits

Jump to the ground
As the Turbo slows to cross the borderline
Run like the wind
As excitement shivers up and down my spine
Down in his barn
My uncle preserved for me an old machine
For fifty-odd years
To keep it as new has been his dearest dream

That hides a shining car

From a better, vanished time
We fire up the willing engine
Responding with a roar
Tires spitting gravel
I commit my weekly crime

Wind in my hair
Shifting and drifting
Mechanical music

Suddenly ahead of me
Across the mountainside
A gleaming alloy air-car
Shoots towards me, two lanes wide
I spin around with shrieking tires
To run the deadly race
Go screaming through the valley
As another joins the chase

Drive like the wind
Straining the limits of machine and man
Laughing out loud with fear and hope
I've got a desperate plan
At the one-lane bridge
I leave the giants stranded at the riverside
Race back to the farm
To dream with my uncle at the fireside

Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream

He saw stars in his eyes, and the very next day
Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it, but he knew for sure
That one guitar felt good in his hands
Didn't take long to understand
Just one guitar, slung way down low
Was a one way ticket, only one way to go

Now, I'm a jet fuel genius - I can solve the world's problems
Without even trying
I got dozens of friends, and the fun never ends
That is, as long as I'm buying

Is it any wonder I'm not the president?
Is it any wonder I'm null and void?

Is it any wonder I've got too much time on my hands?
It's ticking away with my sanity
I've got too much time on my hands
It's hard to believe such a calamity
I got too much time on my hands
And it's ticking away, ticking away from me
Too much time on my hands

Too much time on my hands

Too much time on my hands

63,Who's Crying Now,Escape,Journey,1981,300146,58,"

[Verse 1]
It's been a mystery
And still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way street
The taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

[Chorus]
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder, who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
I wonder who's crying now

[Verse 2]
So many stormy nights
So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change
Their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fighting is worth
The love they save

[Chorus]
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
I wonder who's crying now

[Bridge]
Only so many tears you can cry
'Till the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die

Whoooooa-oh-whoa
Whoooa-oh
Ooooooh-whoa, ooh-whooa

[Chorus]
One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who will be the lonely one
Wonder who's crying now

Burning hot but you don't feel the pain
Your desire is insane

I know what I need and I need it fast
Yeah, there's one thing in common that we both share
That's a need for for each other anytime, anywhere

Now everybody have you heard
If you're in the game, then the stroke's the word
Don't take no rhythm, don't take no style
Got a thirst for chillin', grab your vile
You put your right hand out, give a firm hand-shake
Talk to me about that one big break
Spread your ear-pollution both far and wide
Keep your contributions by your side, stroke has struck me
Could be a winner, girl, you move quite well
Stroke has struck me, stroke has struck me
You got your number down, stroke has struck me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now
You put your left foot out keep it all in place
Work your way right into my case
First you try to bet me you make my backbone slide
But when you found you bet me, skip on by, keep on
Stroke has struck me
Give me the blues all night long
Stroke has struck me, stroke has struck me
You're so together boy, stroke has struck me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now
Better listen now, it ain't no joke

Let your conscience fail ya, just do the stroke
Don'tcha take no chances, keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances, you can't stop you just

Better listen now, it ain't no joke

[Verse 1]
I loved a girl named Ruth once but lost her on my way
I saw her shadow walking on a shore leave world today
And now it’s time for going; I leave this world behind
I’ve even lost her shadow, save the one left on my mind

[Verse 2]
I loved dark Miramanee on a world called Paradise
I dreamed away a season there, my years drowned in her eyes
All duty was forgotten, all thought of death denied
I held her in my arms all night and in my arms she died

[Verse 3]
I loved sweet, bright-eyed Edith outside time’s written line
She told me all her secrets and I never told her mine
My world’s survival waited, asked all I could devise
I kept a friend from saving her; she fell before my eyes

[Verse 4]
There was a maid named Rayna once, immortal and unknown
I battled with Methuselah to have her love alone
Her battle was the harder, too fierce, too bittersweet
It tore her untried heart in two; she crumbled at my feet

[Verse 5]
I love them and I lose them and too many times they die
I come home broken-hearted and back to my stars I fly
My steel and star-drive lady, I keep no love but you
And when this mission’s over, I suppose you’ll leave me too
I guess you’ll leave me too

She loves to be one of the girls
She lives in the place in the side of our lives
Where nothing is ever put straight
She turns herself 'round and she smiles and she says
'This is it, that's the end of the joke'
And loses herself in her dreaming and sleep
And her lovers walk through in their coats

She's pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?

All of her lovers all talk of her notes
And the flowers that they never sent
And wasn't she easy?
Isn't she pretty in pink?
The one who insists he was first in the line
Is the last to remember her name
He's walking around in this dress that she wore
She is gone, but the joke's the same

Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink

Caroline talks to you softly sometimes
She says 'I love you' and 'too much'
She doesn't have anything you want to steal
Well, nothing you can touch

She buttons your shirt
The traffic is waiting outside, she hands you this coat
She gives you her clothes, these cars collide

81,Can't Happen Here,Difficult To Cure,Rainbow,1981-02-03,297266,37,"

Contaminated fish and micro chips
Huge supertankers on Arabian trips
Oily propaganda from the leaders' lips
All about the future

There's people over here, people over there
Everybody's looking for a little more air
Crossing all the borders just to take their share
Planning for the future

And we're so abused, and we're so confused
It's easy to believe that someone's gonna light the fuse
Can't happen here, can't happen here
All that you fear they're telling you, can't happen here

Supersonic planes for a holiday boom
Rio de Janeiro in an afternoon
People out of work but there's people on the moon
Looking for the future

Concrete rack-tracks nationwide
Juggernauts carving up the countryside
Cars by the million on a one way ride
Using up the future

And we're so abused, and we're so confused
It's easy to believe that someone's gonna light the fuse
Can't happen here, can't happen here
All that you fear they're telling you, can't happen here

Satellites spying for the CIA
The KGB and the men in grey
Wonder if I'm gonna see another day
Somewhere in the future

We got everything we need for a peaceful time
Take what you want but you can't take mine
Everybody's living on the Siegfried line
Worried 'bout the future

And we're so abused, and we're so confused
It's so easy to believe that someone's gonna light it
Easy to believe someone's gonna light the fuse
Can't happen here, can't happen here
All that you fear they're telling you
Can't happen here can it?

There is no political solution
To our troubled evolution
Have no faith in constitution
There is no bloody revolution

[Chorus]
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world

Our so-called leaders speak
With words they try to jail you
They subjugate the meek
But it's the rhetoric of failure

We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world

[Verse 3]
Where does the answer lie?
Living from day to day
If it's something we can't buy
There must be another way

[Chorus]
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world
We are spirits in the material world
Are spirits in the material world

Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet

Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street

I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance?
And incidents arose from circumstance
One thing led to another, we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And now you find yourself in Eighty Two
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings

'Cause it's the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

[Verse 4]
And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself?
Teenage ambitions you remember well

Somewhere in a lonely hotel room
There's a guy starting to realize
That his eternal fate has turned its back on him
It's two A.M

It's two A.M., the fear has gone
I'm sitting here waitin', the gun still warm
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances

Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Double crossed messenger all alone
Can't get no connection, can't get through
Where are you?

Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hitman comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated

And he says, ""Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?""

With her hands in her hair

Her like she used to be

Took a look down a westbound road
Right away I made my choice
Headed out to my big two-wheeler
I was tired of my own voice
Took a bead on the northern plains
And just rolled that power on

[Verse 2]
Twelve hours out of Mackinac City
Stopped in a bar to have a brew
Met a girl and we had a few drinks
And I told her what I'd decided to do
She looked out the window a long long moment
Then she looked into my eyes
She didn't have to say a thing
I knew what she was thinkin'

[Chorus]
Roll, roll me away
Won't you roll me away tonight
I too am lost, I feel double-crossed
And I'm sick of what's wrong and what's right
We never even said a word
We just walked out and got on that bike
And we rolled
And we rolled clean out of sight

[Verse 3]
We rolled across the high plains
Deep into the mountains
Felt so good to me
Finally feelin' free
Somewhere along a high road
The air began to turn cold
She said she missed her home
I headed on alone, oh!

Stood alone on a mountain top
Starin' out at the Great Divide
I could go east, I could go west
It was all up to me to decide
Just then I saw a young hawk flyin'
And my soul began to rise
And pretty soon
My heart was singin'

[Chorus]
Roll, roll me away
I'm gonna roll me away tonight
Gotta keep rollin', gotta keep ridin'
Keep searchin' till I find what's right
And as the sunset faded I spoke
To the faintest first starlight
And I said next time
Next time
We'll get it right

[Verse 1]
Sprawling on the fringes of the city
In geometric order
An insulated border
In between the bright lights
And the far unlit unknown

[Verse 2]
Growing up it all seems so one-sided
Opinions all provided
The future pre-decided
Detached and subdivided
In the mass production zone
Nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone

[Chorus: Geddy Lee & Neil Peart]
(Subdivisions) --
In the high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
(Subdivisions) --
In the basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out

[Post-Chorus]
Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth

[Verse 3]
Drawn like moths we drift into the city
The timeless old attraction
Cruising for the action
Lit up like a firefly
Just to feel the living night

[Verse 4]
Some will sell their dreams for small desires
Or lose the race to rats
Get caught in ticking traps
And start to dream of somewhere
To relax their restless flight
Somewhere out of a memory
Of lighted streets on quiet nights

[Chorus: Geddy Lee & Neil Peart]
(Subdivisions) --
Ihe high school halls
In the shopping malls
Conform or be cast out
(Subdivisions) --
Ihe basement bars
In the backs of cars
Be cool or be cast out

[Post-Chorus]
Any escape might help to smooth
The unattractive truth
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe
The restless dreams of youth

You're leaving now
It's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you'd planned it all along

[Verse 2]
I see it now
It comes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry eyed
You think that I would have known by now

[Chorus]
Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over

(Only time will tell)
One thing is sure
That time will tell
(Only time will tell)
If you were wrong
The brightest ring around the moon
Will darken when I die

Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
The lying's over
Gone, like the tears that used to tide me over

Stranded like a runaway lost at sea
City on a rainy day down in the harbor
Watching as the gray clouds shadow the bay
Looking everywhere 'cause I had to find you
This is not the way that I remember it here
Anyone will tell you it's a prisoner island
Hidden in the summer for a million years

Great Southern Land
Burned you black

So you look into the land, it will tell you a story
Story about a journey ended long ago
Listen to the motion of the wind in the mountains
Maybe you can hear them talking like I do
They're gonna betray you, they're gonna forget you
Are you gonna let them take you over that way?

Great Southern Land
Great Southern Land
You walk alone
Like a primitive man
And they make it work
With sticks and bones
See their hungry eyes
It's a hungry home

I hear the sound
Of the strangers' voices

They burned you black
Black against the ground

[Instrumental intro 0:00-2:16]

[Verse 1]
A long time ago came a man on a track
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back
And he put down his load
Where he thought it was the best
He made a home in the wilderness
He built a cabin and a winter store
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore
And the other travelers came walking down the track
And they never went further, no
They never went back

[Chorus]
Then came the churches, then came the schools
Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road

[Verse 2]
Then came the mines, then came the ore
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide
Like a rolling river

[Instrumental break 3:53-4:59]

[Bridge]
And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze
People driving home from the factories
There's six lanes of traffic
Three lanes moving slow

[Instrumental break 5:15-7:16]

[Verse 3]
I used to like to go to work, but they shut it down
I've got a right to go to work
But there's no work here to be found
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed
We're gonna have to reap
From some seed that's been sowed

[Chorus]
And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code
All the way down the telegraph road

[Verse 4]
You know, I'd sooner forget
But I remember those nights
When life was just a bet on a race
Between the lights
You had your head on my shoulder
You had your hand in my hair
Now you act a little colder
Like you don't seem to care

[Chorus]
But believe in me, baby, and I'll take you away
From out of this darkness and into the day
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names
Cause I've run every red light on memory lane
I've seen desperation explode into flames
And I don't want to see it again
From all of these signs saying, ""sorry, but we're closed""
All the way
Down the telegraph road

I never believed in things that I couldn't see
I said if I can't feel it then how could it be?
No, no magic could happen to me
And then I saw you, I couldn't believe it
You took my heart, I couldn't retrieve it
Said to myself, ""What's it all about?""
Now I know there can be no doubt

[Verse 1]
Athena, I had no idea how much I would need her
In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her
My heart starts palpitating when I think my guess was wrong
But I think I will get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Athena, all I ever want to do is please her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I think I'll  get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb

[Chorus]
Just a girl, just a girl[x3]
She's just a girl

[Verse 2]
Athena, my heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath
I felt like one of those flattened ants you find on a crazy path
I would of topped myself to give her time she did not need to ask
Was I a suicidal psychopath?
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Consumed, there was a beautiful white horse I saw on a dream stage
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe living in his rib cage
I felt like a pickled priest who was being flambed
You got me requisitioned Blondie
She's just a girl – she's a bomb

[Chorus]
I'm happy, I'm ecstatic
Just a girl, just a girl[x3]
She's just a girl

[Verse 3]
Look into the face of a child
Measure how long you smiled
Before the memory claimed
How long would children remain
How long could children remain
Athena, you picked me up by my lapels and screamed ""leave her""
It felt like waking up in heaven on an empty meter
And now you are stuck with a castrated leader
And I hate the creep, I didn't mean that

[Bridge]
She's a bomb
I just said it
She is a bomb
I didn't mean it, please
She's a bomb

Athena, I had no idea how much I need her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone

On a rainy night, you showed up at my door
Child of the night, down and forlorn
Still, I took you in, it's in the stars above
All girls are made the same, they all need a little love

[Pre-Chorus]
And the magic of the moment
Exploded with desire
When the time is right, the sparks ignite
And set the night on fire

[Chorus]
It's chain lightnin', too hot to fight
Hot on the heels of a Saturday night
Chain lightnin', out of control
Straight to the heart and down to your soul
Chain lightnin', heavens above
Another day older, still searching for love
Chain lightnin', too hot to fight
And it's hotter than hell in the heavens tonight

[Verse 2]
I was livin' hard, I was feelin' down and lonely
When toward the boulevard, a limousine moved slowly
And I noticed in the back seat, a lady wrapped in fur
Her eyes burned through me, and mine stared back at her

[Pre-Chorus]
And I recognize the moment
And I open up her door
I knew I would regret it
I'd been burned before

Chain lightnin', too hot to fight
Hot on the heels of a Saturday night
Chain lightnin', out of control
Straight to the heart and down to your soul
Chain lightnin', heavens above
Another day older, still searching for love
Chain lightnin', too hot to fight
And it's hotter than hell in the heavens tonight

[Bridge]
And lord, it's so hot when the chain reaction
Is set off with a kiss
And it's so tough when the satisfaction
Is greater than the risk
When you look in her eyes and you realize
This time you can't resist
It's chain lightnin'

And the magic of the moment
Exploded with desire
When the time is right, the sparks ignite
And set the night on fire

For the usual fee, plus expenses
Confidential information, it's in a diary
This is my investigation, it's not a public inquiry

You get to meet all sorts in this line of work
Treachery and treason, there's always an excuse for it
And when I find the reason, I still can't get used to it

What have you got to take away?

Blinds on the windows, and a pain behind the eyes

Maybe there's another way to do this

{​Music Video - Break}​

[Verse 2]
Say - you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You, lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

[Chorus]
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

[Bridge]
After my own indecision
They confused me so
Owner of a lonely heart
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap
Owner of a lonely heart
And don't you hesitate at all - no no
Yow!
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

{​Instrumental}​

[Chorus]
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

[Outro]
Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
It will excite, it will delight
It will give a better start
Owner of a lonely heart

Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Owner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it
Just receive it
(Owner of a lonely heart)

Ah
Watch out, you might get what you're after
Cool, babies - strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house

[Verse 2]
Hold tight, wait 'til the party's over
Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house

Here's your ticket, pack your bag, it's time for jumping overboard
The transportation is here
Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are
Fighting fire with fire, ah!

[Verse 3]
All wet, here, you might need a raincoat
Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred sixty-five degrees
Burning down the house

[Chorus 2]
It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work say, “Baby, what did you expect?”
Gonna burst into flame, ah

Burning down the house

My house is out of the ordinary
That’s right, don't wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house

No visible means of support and you have not seen nothing yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire, ah

They like to get you in a compromising position
Well, they like to get you there and smile in your face
Yeah, they think they're so cute when they got you in that condition
But I think it's a total disgrace
And I say

I fight authority, authority always wins
Well, I fight authority, authority always wins
Well, I've been doing it since I was a young kid
And I come out grinnin'
Well, I fight authority, authority always wins
(Oh yeah!)

I call up my preacher
I say, ""Give me strength for round 5.""
He said, ""You don't need no strength, you need to grow up son.""
I said, ""Growin' up leads to growin' old and then to dyin'
Ooo, and dyin' to me don't sound like all that much fun.""
And so I'll say

I fight authority, authority always wins

New York, New York, is everything they say
And no place that I'd rather be
Where else can you do a half a million things
All at a quarter to three
When they play their music, ooh that modern music
They like it with a lot of style
But t's still that same old back beat rhythm
That really really drives 'em wild

They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll, THE heart of rock and roll is still beating

LA, Hollywood, and the Sunset Strip
Is something everyone should see
Neon signs and the pretty pretty girls

All dressed so SCANTILY ('sexily' on the live version)
When they play their music
That hard rock music
They like it with a lot of flash
But it's still that same old back beat rhythm
That really kicks 'em in the

But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime

Cry out for everything you ever might have wanted
I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
But you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime

Maybe that's because you securely locked me up
Then threw away the key

Please would you find the key
Oh pretty mama
Please won't you let me go free

I thought that I'd got it made
How could I be so blind?

You said good-bye on a corner

You set me on a firmly laid and simple course

Hast du etwas Zeit für mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von 99 Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Denkst du vielleicht grad an mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von 99 Luftballons
Und, dass sowas von sowas kommt

[Strophe 2]
99 Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man für Ufos aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General
'Ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so wär
Dabei war'n dort am Horizont
Nur 99 Luftballons

[Strophe 3]
99 Düsenflieger
Jeder war ein großer Krieger
Hielten sich für Captain Kirk
Es gab ein großes Feuerwerk
Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf 99 Luftballons

[Strophe 4]
99 Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen, „Krieg!“, und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht?
Dass es einmal so weit kommt
Wegen 99 Luftballons

There's a little black spot
On the sun today
(That's my soul up there)
It's the same old thing as yesterday
(That's my soul up there)
There's a black hat
Caught in a high treetop
(That's my soul up there)
There's a flag pole rag
And the wind won't stop
(That's my soul up there)

[Chorus]
I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain

[Verse 3]
There's a fossil that's trapped
In a high cliff wall
(That's my soul up there)
There's a dead salmon
Frozen in a waterfall
(That's my soul up there)
There's a blue whale beached
By a spring tide's ebb
(That's my soul up there)
There's a butterfly trapped
In a spider's web
(That's my soul up there)

[Chorus]
I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain

[Bridge]
There's a king on a throne
With his eyes torn out
There's a blind man looking
For a shadow of doubt
There's a rich man
Sleeping on a golden bed
There's a skeleton
Choking on a crust of bread

[Guitar solo]
King of pain

[Verse 4]
There's a red fox torn
By a huntsman's pack
(That's my soul up there)
There's a black-winged gull
With a broken back
(That's my soul up there)
There's a little black spot
On the sun today
It's the same old thing as yesterday

[Chorus]
I have stood here before
Inside the pouring rain
With the world turning circles
Running 'round my brain
I guess I'm always hoping
That you'll end this reign
But it's my destiny
To be the king of pain

[Outro]
King of pain, king of pain
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain, I'll always be
King of pain

Hard Times you had before you
I knew when I first saw you
You girl you've always been mistreated, cheated

So leave it all behind you
It took so long to find you
I know that we can last forever, ever and more, more, oh

[Chorus]
Don't cry now that I've found you
Don't cry take a look around you
Don't cry it took so long to find you
Do what you want, but little darling please, don't cry

I knew I'd never doubt it
I was so sure about it
Don't think of all that's been before

I'll hear you when you're calling
I'll catch you when you're falling
Don't worry I will always be there
Like never before, oh, oh

Sometimes in my bed at night
I curse the dark and I pray for light
And sometimes, the light's no consolation

Blinded by a memory
Afraid of what it might do to me
And the tears and the sweat
Only mock my desperation

Don't you know me
I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fighting for?

Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line
Labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city

Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me

Taught me how to shoot to kill
A specialist with a deadly skill
A skill I needed to have to be a survivor

It's over now or so they say
Well, sometimes, it don't work out that way
'Cause you're never the same
When you've been under fire, no

Don't you know me
I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fighting for?

Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line
Labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city

Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's done to me

Don't you know me
I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fighting for, no

Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line
Labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city

Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me

Walking on a thin line
Walking on a thin line
Walking on a thin line

Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you
Feeling that it's gone, can't change your mind
If we can't go on to survive the tide, love divides

[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you, one night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

[Verse 2]
Troubled times
Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain – distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain
If you must go, I wish you love
You'll never walk alone, take care, my love
Miss you, love

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you, one night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you

Turn into a shining band of gold

Bought it at the five and dime

Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in

Boring and confiscated

I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

[Chorus 1]
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

[Verse 3]
Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, gimme just one look

[Chorus 2]
You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye

Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking bout

Now everywhere he goes out looking for work
They just tell him that he's too old

I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever

And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

There's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire

I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us

I've been holding back the night
I've been searching for a clue from you
I'm gonna try with all my might
To make this story line come true

Can you feel me tremble when we touch
Can you feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
This love affair can't wait

I can't hold back
I'm on the edge
I can't hold back
Your voice explodes
Inside my head

I can't hold back
I won't back down
Girl, it's too late
To turn back now

Another shooting star goes by
And in the night the silence
Speaks to you and I

And now the time has come at last
Don't let the moment run too fast

I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us

There's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire

I can't hold back
I'm on the edge
I can't hold back
Your voice explodes
Inside my head

I can't hold back
I won't back down
Girl, it's too late
To turn back now

I can see you tremble when we touch
Ooh, and I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
This love affair can't wait

I can't hold back
I can't hold back
I can't hold back

[Verse 1]
What more can I do, there's nothing I haven't tried
Still it's so hard for her to notice
I've tried hard to be straight
There's nothing left I can say
If only she would look my way

[Chorus]
(She don't know me) She don't know
(She don't see me) She don't care
(She can't hear me) She can't hear
(Can not help me) She don't want
(She don't want me) Like I want her
(Like I want her) I gotta tell her
(Got to tell her) That I love her
(That I love her)
She doesn't even know my name

[Verse 2]
I dream of when she'll be mine
I dream of crossing that line
And holding her so tender
Dreaming it could come true
So many things I would do
If only you'd give me a chance

[Chorus]
(She don't know me) She don't know
(She don't see me) She don't care
(She can't hear me) She can't hear

I'm rockin' tonite--I'm walkin' on air
Gonna find me some trouble--gonna grab my share
I want ya tonite--I want ya with me
Make me guilty of love in the first degree

(You want it all right)...We're goin' in style
Say you walk right--you talk right--and your hair's so wild
(Snow-white)--Hey that's not what I mean
We go down in the shadows and crawl between

Moonlight in the city brings the magic to your eyes
Freezin' a moment--leave me paralyzed
Breathe an emotion--set it dancin' in my ear
Bring on the rhythm when I hold you near

Take me in your arms--roll me through the night
Take me to your heart--rock me tonite

(You do it all right)--You're passion to see
You been schooled in the arts of romancin' me
(Hold tight)--You're in for a ride
Can you feel the blood poundin' way down inside

--No one's stoppin' us now--
We go down, down where the music's loud
(If it's all night)--Hey that's all right by me
Go and play on my love--play it all for me

Life's never easy--we can make it if we try
Takin' our chances--standin' side by side
Live for the moment--on that we can agree
Come and take me where I long to be

Take me in your arms--roll me through the night
Take me to your heart--rock me tonite

Take me in your arms
It's alright (it's alright)
Take me to your heart--rock me tonite

A time for all...and all in time
A step beyond the borderline
Of who we are and where we long to be... (yeah)
When every night you hear the sound
Of wakin' up and breakin' down
You find a chance and heave it all away

C'mon babe
Take me in your arms--roll me through the night
Take me to your heart--rock me tonite

([unclear]) Take me in your arms
It's alright (it's alright)
Take me to your heart (c'mon take me!) rock me tonite

Take me in your arms--turn me to the light
Take me to your heart
Rock me! Rock, rock, rock and rock me
Rock, rock, rock, and roll it

It's alright
Ye-yeah
Take(?) me to the light

You're the silent type
And you caught my eye
But I never thought that I'd be touchin' you

How was I to know
I'd let my feelin's go
And that I'd be yours before the night was through

One night love affair
Tryin' to make like we don't care
We were both reachin' out for somethin'

One night love affair
Pretendin' it ain't there
Oh - and now we're left with nothin'

When the mornin' breaks
We go our separate ways
If the night was made for love it ain't for keeps

But I lose control
As I watch you go
All my senses say I'm in this much too deep
Now you're outta reach

One night love affair
Tryin' to make like we don't care
We were both reachin' out for somethin'

How long I have wanted
This dream to come true
And as it approaches
I can't believe I'm through

I've tried
Oh, how I've tried for a life
Yes, a life I thought I knew

Oh, it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done

Time seems to have frozen
But the mind can be fooled
As the days pass, I discover
Destiny just can't be ruled

Hard times
Oh, hard times for the prize
Yes, the prize I thought I knew

Oh, it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done

Oh, it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done

Oh, it's the price we gotta pay

Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

[Verse 2]
Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Touch, if you will, my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

Turned on the radio
Sounded like a disco
Must've turned the dial for a couple of miles
But I couldn't find no rock 'n roll

This computerized crap ain't gettin' me off
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock

London to L.A.,
Talkin' 'bout the new wave
For a couple of bucks you get a weird haircut
And waste your life away

Around the world or around the block
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock

Get me my D.J.,
I got somethin' he's gotta play
Wanna hear it I can't wait
So turn it up, turn it up...

Kick down the barricades
Listen what the kids say
From time to time people change their minds
But the music is here to stay

I've seen it all from the bottom to the top
Everywhere I go kids wanna rock

Around the world or around the block
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock

Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock

Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you
Missing you, missing you

Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left

[Verse 2]
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

[Chorus]
I ain't missing you at all
(Missing you, missing you)
Since you've been gone away
(Missing you, missing you)
I ain't missing you
(Missing you, missing you)
No matter what I might say
(Missing you, missing you)

[Verse 3]
There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you

Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

Since you've been gone away

We belong, we belong to the light

[Verse 1]
Many times, I tried to tell you
Many times, I cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you
Cut my feelings to the bone
Don't wanna leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

[Chorus]
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

[Verse 2]
Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit?
Do we distort the facts?
Now, there's no looking forward
Now, there's no turning back
When you say

[Chorus]
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

[Verse 3]
Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere, still you say

[Chorus]
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together
We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better

You don't know when you've got it good

Through each and every nerve and fiber
My broken spirit

Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care?

You must be joking
You don't know a thing about it
You've got no problem
I'd stay right there if I were you
I got it harder
You couldn't dream how hard I got it
Stay out of my shoes

All your power's gonna fade in the haze

Ya who' Jumme gae bile ya heed

I'll drag yer lungs out through yer nose
Space truckers, free and high
Teamsters get ya by and by
That should keep you on your toes

They got a gun at your head
But you ain't necessarily playing their game
They can't resist
A gypsy's kiss
All that's needed to drive them insane

John Wayne, the Alamo
Crazy Horse, Geronimo
I'll smoke a piece with you
Mind, body, heart and soul
We got rock and roll
And there's nothing they can do

Hear the small voice of truth
Above the shouting despair of the crowd
What do you wish?
A gypsy's kiss
Gets you strong for crying out loud

How can I convince you, what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Can we last forever, do we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you

Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain, the man I really am

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Then I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper
The search is over, love was right before my eyes

In the silence, I think of you
I send a message, and I hope it get's through
Think of the distance
Think of the miles
All of the valley's, could take a while

I miss the people
I miss the fun
You're my apparition
She's my only one

And I imagine you standing here
It's subliminal, so inspirational
Man of the world for all the good reasons
Take away the pain and drink the wine

I miss the people
I miss the fun
You're my apparition
She's my only one

In the silence, I think of you
I send a message and I hope it get's through
Think of the distance

All of the valleys, could take a while

I miss the fun
You're my apparition
She's my only one

[Verse 1]
The day is gone
When the angels come to stay
And all the silent whispers
Will be blown away
Lying in the corner
A pair of high heel shoes
Hanging on the wall
Gold and silver for the blues

One too many wasted sunsets
One too many for the road
And after dark the door is always open
Hoping someone else will show

Someone is waiting
Behind an unlocked door
Grey circles overhead
Empties on the floor
The cracks in the walls
Have grown too long
The slow hand is dragging on
Afraid to meet the dawn

One too many wasted sunsets
One too many for the road
And after dark the door is always open
Hoping someone else will show

They're pickin' up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

Rebels been rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance

Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance

Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance

Wild-eyed pistol-wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat
Comin off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance

Well the government bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

To keep the boys from sellin'
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance

But that don't keep the boys
From makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance

Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout
They said, ""Don't come back here, Yankee""
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money

'Cause all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
All she wants to do is dance

Ties her hair up and her blouse buttoned tight
Gets her work done as she waits for the night

If they knew her, how she hides it away
Locked inside, there's the start of a flame
And the feeling that she never will tame
Ooh, as she's walking around like a mystery

So, to America, the brave
Wise men save

I got plans for us
Nights in the scullery
And days instead of me
I only know what to discuss
Oh for anything, but light
Wise men fighting over you
It's not me you see
Pieces of valentine
And just a song of mine
To keep from burning history
Seasons of gasoline and gold
Wise men fold

Tie you down, down I come steal your love

Tie you down, down I come steal your love

A pelvic thrust and the sweat starts to sting ya

Make a bad one good make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

Is this the age of the thunder and rage
Can you feel the ground move 'round your feet
If you take one step closer, it'll lead to another
The crossroad above is where we meet
I shout out for shelter, I need you for something
The whole world is out, they're all on the street
Control yourself, love is all you need
Control yourself, in your eyes
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Be apart of me, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, set yourself free

In pictures of living, in bloodshot a vision
Sweet miracles and strange circumstances
I see the sun up, the showdown, the cool winds that blow down
On the big beat that life-long romance is
You've got a gun in your hand, you're making self plans
Stay with me all through the night
Control yourself, love is all you need
Control yourself, open up your heart
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Be apart of me, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, set yourself free

You can't stop the world for a boy or a girl
Sweet victims of poor circumstances
But you can pour back the love, sweeping down from above
Giving hope and making more chances
Well, I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll come back down here and show me the way
Control yourself, love is all you need
Control yourself, open up your heart
Open up your heart
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, set yourself free

And though they did hurt me so bad

228,Rain On The Scarecrow,Scarecrow,John Mellencamp,1985,226226,50,"

Scarecrow on a wooden cross
Blackbird in the barn
Four hundred empty acres
That used to be my farm
Grew up like my daddy did
My grandpa cleared this land
When I was five
I walked the fence while Grandpa held my hand

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me proud
And son, I`m just sorry
There`s no legacy for you now

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

The crops we grew last summer
Weren`t enough to pay the loans
Couldn`t buy the seed to plant this spring
And the Farmers' Bank foreclosed
Called my old friend Schepman
Up to auction off the land
He said:
""John, it`s just my job
And I hope you understand.""

Hey, calling it your job, ole hoss
Sure don`t make it right
But if you want me to
I`ll say a prayer for your soul tonight

And grandma`s on the front porch swing
With a Bible in her hand
Sometimes I hear her singing
Take me to the Promised Land
When you take away a man`s dignity
He can`t work his fields and cows

There`ll be
Blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

There`s 97 crosses
Planted in the courthouse yard
Ninety-seven families who
Lost ninety-seven farms

I think about my grandpa
My neighbors and my name
And some nights
I feel like dying
Like that scarecrow in the rain

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me proud
And son, I`m just sorry
They`re just memories for you now

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation

Echoes and roars of dinosaurs

And most of the taxis and most of the whores
Are only taking calls for cash, mmm

It all took place so quick
But all I can do is hand it to you
And your latest trick

[Verse 2]
Well now, my door was standing open
Security was laid back and lax
But it was only my heart got-a broken
You must have had a pass key made out of wax
You played robbery with insolence
And I played the blues in twelve bars down on Lovers' Lane
And you never did have the intelligence to use
The twelve keys hanging off of my chain

Well, now it's past last call for alcohol
Past recall has been here and gone
The landlord, he finally paid us all
The satin jazzmen have put away their horns
And we're standing outside of this wonderland
Looking so bereaved and so bereft
Like a Bowery bum when he finally understands
The bottle's empty and there's nothing left, mmm

233,These Dreams,Heart,Heart,1985-07-06,254476,59,"

Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist
Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Is it cloak 'n dagger
Could it be spring or fall
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist
The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

234,All The Things She Said,Once Upon A Time (Super Deluxe),Simple Minds,1985,255853,51,"

Don't you look back on a big lost world
(Crying out tomorrow)
Don't you look down like the heroes say
Come tell me all about it
Take me to the streets where the bonfires burn
Take me in your arms and I'll fade away
When I hear you say what you got to say

Anywhere you go, you know I'll still be waiting
All the things she said, she said
Little darling close your eyes, there'll be no compromising
Of all the things she said, she said

Throw me to the street where the heartbeats beating
(It's beating)
To the peaceful revolution
And the perfect wave, surround me
Tell me 'bout the ocean moving in slow motion
I see it glitter in the sun
Then it's freezing in the moonlight
Never look back, never look back, never look away

If freedom comes and goes, you know I'll still be waiting
All the things she said, she said
You've fought the fight so long, no surrender to temptation
Of all the things she said, she said

Stars will fall out for you
Luck will surrender
I'm calling out to you

Oh, to be near you in the first morning light
I'd be with you, I dream about you
If I could leave here, I would leave here tonight
I'd be with you, I'd stay with you tonight
Tonight

Anywhere you go, you know I'll still be waiting
Of all the things she said, she said
When I look into your eyes, I see a new day rising
Of all the things she said, she said
Through the eyes of love, and to never know what hate is
Of all the things she said, she said
She said, this is our time, she said, this is our place
This is the space my heart wants to be
Little darling close your eyes, there'll be no compromising
All the things she said, she said

235,Small Town,Scarecrow,John Mellencamp,1985,221626,66,"

Well, I was born in a small town
And I live in a small town
Probably die in a small town
Oh, those small communities

All my friends are so small town
My parents live in the same small town
My job is so small town
Provides little opportunity

Educated in a small town
Taught to fear Jesus in a small town
Used to daydream in that small town
Another boring romantic, that's me

But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town
Now she's small town just like me

No, I cannot forget from where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town
And people let me be just what I want to be

Got nothing against a big town
Still hayseed enough to say, ""look who's in the big town""
But my bed is in a small town
Oh, and that's good enough for me

Well, I was born in a small town
And I can breathe in a small town
Gonna die in this small town
Oh that's probably where they'll bury me

[Verse 1]
Baby, I see this world has made you sad
Some people can be bad
The things they do, the things they say
But baby, I'll wipe away those bitter tears
I'll chase away those restless fears
And turn your blue skies into grey

Why worry, there should be laughter after pain
There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now?
Why worry now?

Our love comes shining red and gold

There should be sunshine after rain
These things have always been the same
So why worry now?

It doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
It makes no difference if you're black or if you're white
All men are equal till the victory is won
No color or religion ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

It doesn't matter if you're left or to the right
Don't try to hide behind the cause for which you fight
There'll be no prisoners taken when the day is done
No flag no uniform ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

There's no communication
No one to take the blame
The cries of every nation
They're falling on deaf ears again

Out in the fields
Out in the fields, they are falling one by one
Out in the fields, no flag has ever stopped a bullet from a gun
Death is just a heartbeat away

Out in the fields, a heartbeat away
Out in the fields, death is just a heartbeat away
Out in the fields, a heartbeat away
Out in the fields

Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day

OUT!

I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration - could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
You're just, just, just wasting time

Something happens and I'm head over heels

Throw it away

I made a fire and watching it burn
I thought of your future
With one foot in the past, now just how long will it last?
No, no, no, have you no ambition?
My mother and my brother’s used to breathing clean air
Nothing ever changes when you’re acting your age
And dreaming I’m a doctor
Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby
It’s hard to be a man when there’s a gun in your hand
Nothing ever changes when you’re acting your age
Oh, I feel so

[Chorus: Roland Orzabal]
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out 'till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

Caught you in the act, can't put up with that
Messing where you shouldn't be
I wanna hear you say you're sorry
'Cuz nobody takes advantage of me
You're missing the mark, shooting in the dark
I'm pulling the wool from my eyes
Baby, don't push me further
It's gonna hurt you if it happens twice

If looks could kill
You'd be lying on the floor
You'd be begging me, please, please
Baby don't hurt me no more
If looks could kill
You'd be reeling from the pain
And you'd never lie again
If looks could kill

Living on the edge, hanging by a thread
I'm watching every move you make
You don't want to see my anger
So don't you make another mistake
Love is on the line, I ain't about to be kind
That's a promise and a threat
If I was you, I'd really cool it
Or risk a night you will never forget

If looks could kill
You'd be lying on the floor
You'd be begging me, please, please
Baby don't hurt me no more
If looks could kill
You'd be reeling from the pain
And you'd never lie again
If looks could kill

I was a fool to believe in you
A sucker for every line
I'm a little less blind than I was before
I can see right through your design

If looks could kill
You'd be lying on the floor
You'd be begging me, please, please
Baby don't hurt me no more
If looks could kill
You'd be reeling from the pain
And you'd never lie again
If looks could kill

You'd be lying on the floor
You'd be begging me, please, please
Baby don't hurt me no more
If looks could kill
You'd be reeling from the pain
And you'd never lie again

247,Minutes To Memories,Scarecrow,John Mellencamp,1985,251493,42,"

On a Greyhound thirty miles beyond Jamestown
He saw the sun set on the Tennessee line
He looked at the young man who was riding beside him
He said I'm old kind of worn out inside
I worked my whole life in the steel mills near Gary
And my father before me I helped build this land
Now I'm seventy-seven and with God as my witness
I earned every dollar that passed through my hands
My family and friends are the best thing I've known
Through the eye of the needle I'll carry them home

Days turn to minutes and minutes to memories
Life sweeps away the dreams that we have planned
You are young and you are the future
So suck it up and tough it out and be the best you can

The rain hit the old dog in the twilight's last gleaming
He said Son it sounds like rattling old bones
This highway is long but I know some that are longer
By sunup tomorrow I guess I'll be home
Through the hills of Kentucky 'cross the Ohio river
The old man kept talking 'bout his life and his times
He fell asleep with his head against the window
He said an honest man's pillow is his peace of mind
This world offers riches and riches will grow wings
I don't take stock in those uncertain things

Days turn to minutes and minutes to memories
Life sweeps away the dreams that we have planned
You are young and you are the future
So suck it up and tough it out and be the best you can

The old man had a vision but it was hard for me to follow
I do things my way and I pay a high price
When I think back on the old man and the bus ride
Now that I'm older I can see he was right

Another hot one out on highway eleven
This is my life It's what I've chosen to do
There's no free rides, no one said it'd be easy
The old man told me this my son i'm telling it to you

Days turn to minutes and minutes to memories
Life sweeps away the dreams that we have planned
You are young and you are the future
So suck it up and tough it out and be the best you can

Push him away
No, no, no
No, no, no
Don't let him stay

He gets inside to stare at her
The seeping mouth
The mouth that knows
The secret you
Always you
A smile to hide the fear away
Smear this man across the walls
Like strawberries and cream
Its the only way, its the only way to be

Exactly the same clean bed
But I've stayed away too long this time
And I've got too big to fit this time

Cities, buildings falling down
Satellites come crashing down
I see them falling out the skies like eagles
All mirrored glass and shattered egos
But in a corner of the world
We'd meet to laugh and drink and plan our sequels
'Cause in the alleyways and bars downtown
They're singing up from here to there can we go
This city comes alive at night
See these city walls are heaving
And if these old city walls should crash
Amid the rubble you'd find us breathing

Come see what you see in me
'Cause boy, I believe in you
Come see what you're seeing
All gone just ghost dancing, going all the way through

You talk about the Lebanon
You tell me 'bout the Dawn in Eden
You talk about South Africa
I tell you about the Irish children
You say one more Polish Knight could come
And blow away the doors to Freedom
And if Mother Ethiopia could blow away
The tears that we see run
O blow them away
Blow, blow away
We Will blow them away
O blow, blow away
Blow, blow away
Blow, blow away

Come see what you see in me
'Cause boy, I believe in you
Come see what you're seeing
They're all gone just ghost dancing, going all the way through

You know I believe in you
Oh yes I believe, you know I believe in you
You say you believe
I believe, I believe, going all the way through, yeah
Come take me back home, come on and take me away
Ghost Dancing

The car pulled up, the girl she jumped in
The boy he wore a medal that was shining from his skin
With the windows pulled up, their radio tuned in
She's hitting from the stars, he's hitting for the moon
She said, one last kiss while you look across the Land
Move it into overdrive and take me by my hand
When the car broke, the rebels saw smoke
And they all went to heaven in a stupid fantasy, go
Take me away

I would walk home every evening
Through the pyramids of light
I would feed myself from silence
Wash it down with empty nights

Then your innocent distractions
Hit me so hard
My emotional reaction
Caught me off guard

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before
And it was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more

No one else
Has ever made me feel this way
When I asked you how you did it
You just say
It was nothin' at all

Now, I walk home every evening
And my feet are quick to move
'Cause I know my destination
Is a warm and waiting you

From our first communication
It was clear
Any thought of moderation
Would soon disappear

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before

Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now did you read the news today
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
There burning into the night
There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?
Well this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in
Ooh, Superman where are you now
When everything's gone wrong somehow?
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour
This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why, this is a land of confusion
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in
I remember long ago when the sun was shining
Yes, and the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight, so long ago
I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know, we'll never keep
Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see, this is a land of confusion?
Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to

Pictures in an empty room

Better change your tune, yeah!
You reach for the golden ring
Reach for the sky

We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind

The truth gets left behind
And falls between the cracks
Standing on broken dreams
Never losing sight, oh!
Well just spread your wings

We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind

269,A Matter of Trust,The Bridge,Billy Joel,1986-07-28,248746,53,"

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began
With a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will, it's just a question of when

[Chorus]
I've lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire
The more you get burned
But that won't happen to us
Because it's always been
A matter of trust

[Verse 2]
I know you're an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not
Lose your faith in this world
But I can't offer you proof
But you're gonna face
A moment of truth

[Chorus]
It's hard when you're always afraid
You just recover
When another belief is betrayed
So break my heart if you must
It's a matter of trust

[Bridge]
You can't go the distance
With too much resistance
I know you have doubts
But for God's sake don't shut me out

[Verse 3]
This time you've got nothing to lose
You can take it, you can leave it
Whatever you choose
I won't hold back anything
And I'll walk away a fool or a king

[Chorus]
Some love is just a lie of the mind
It's make believe until it's only a matter of time
And some might have learned to adjust
But then it never was a matter of trust

[Bridge]
I'm sure you're aware love
We've both had our share of
Believing too long
When the whole situation was wrong

[Verse 4]
Some love is just a lie of the soul
A constant battle
For the ultimate state of control
After you've heard lie upon lie
There can hardly be a question of why

[Chorus]
Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began
With a passionate start
But that can't happen to us
Because it's always been
A matter of trust

[Outro]
It's a matter of trust
It's always been a matter of trust
It's a matter of trust
Cause it's always been
A matter of trust

My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste

So don't be surprised to see me
Back in that bright part of town

Will open up again

Will smile and take me in

And I'll drink and dance with one hand free
Let the world back into me

To make life be life to me
And I hope that you're still out there
And you're like you used to be

And have the world so easily
And oh we'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life again

In the high life again

We'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time
Will open up again
We'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched us once

And we'll drink and dance with one hand free
And have the world so easily
And oh we'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life again

High life
Back in the high life
Oh, we'll be back

Late at night I close my eyes
And think of how things could have been
And when I look back
I remember some words you had said to me

It's better to have lost at love
Then never to have loved at all

[Chorus]
I won't forget you baby
(I won't forget you)
Even though I should
I won't forget you baby
(I won't forget you)
Even though I should, yeah

Sometimes in my head
I can still see pictures of you
And I laugh to myself
When I think of all those crazy things that we used to do

Although miles come between us
Just between you and me

[Chorus]
I should let you fade away
But that just wouldn't be me
Oh, baby

Although miles come between us
Just between you and me

I won't forget you baby

They lived in peace, not long ago
A mighty Indian tribe
But the winds of change
Made them realize, that the promises were lies

[Verse 2]
The white man's greed, in search of gold
Made the nation bleed
They had lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn

Cherokee - marching on the trail of tears

[Verse 3]
They were driven hard, across the plains
And walked for many moons
Cause the winds of change
Had made them realize, that the promises were lies

Left them in despair
They lost their faith
And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn

Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Go on)
I can't go on (Can't go on)
If I'm on my own

[Verse 3: Jason Scheff, Bill Champlin, Both]
Do you believe a love could run so strong?
Do you believe a love could pass you by?
There was no special one for me
I was the lonely one, you see
But then my heart lost all control
Now you're all that I know

[Chorus: Bill Champlin, Peter Cetera]
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Go on)
I can't go on
If I'm on my own
I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Go on)

[Outro: Bill Champlin, (Peter Cetera)]
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on without somebody I can count on
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around, and never be alone
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on without somebody I can count on
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around, and never be alone

[Verse 1]
She came all the way from America
She had a blind date with destiny
And the sound of Te Awamutu
Had a truly sacred ring
Now her parents
Are divorced
And her friend's committing suicide

[Chorus]
I could not escape
A plea from the heart
You know what it means to me
You said don't walk away
I'm down on my knees
Well, please don't be mean to me

[Verse 2]
So I talked to you for an hour
In the bar of a small town hotel
And you asked me what I was thinking
I was thinking of a padded cell
With a black and white T.V
To stop us from getting lonely

[Chorus]
I could not escape
A plea from the heart
You know what it means to me
You said don't walk away
I'm down on my knees
So please don't be mean to me

You know I could not escape
A plea from the heart
Mysterious sympathy
I couldn't wait for a chance
To walk out the door
You know what it means to me

I saw you lying in the arms of a poet
I...
I heard him tell you
T-tantalising

I could not escape
You're down on the floor
You know what it means to me
I couldn't wait for a chance
Walk out the door

Down on my knees
You know what it means
What it means

Ah oh no-o-o-oh

In the arms of the poet
You know what it means

I went to bed too late and got up too soon
My poor head still spinnin' from too much booze
I got a foot in the gutter, a foot in the grave
Ain't seen home in the last three days

Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in
Livin' my life, sin after sin
Night rolls up and I do it again
Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in

No tell, motel, hotel bed
If it wasn't for the sunlight, I'd swear I was dead
I got a girl on the left of me, a girl on the right
I know damn well I slept with both last night

Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in
Livin' my life, sin after sin
Night rolls up and I do it again
Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in
Sin after sin

I'm late for work on Monday and my boss is bitchin'
Can't get out of bed 'cause my head's still spinnin'
My hair's in a rat's nest, I look like hell
Half alive or half dead, I just can't tell

Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in
Livin' my life, sin after sin
Night rolls up and I do it again
Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in

Cat dragged in

Look what the cat dragged

No sleep till
Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Ad-Rock, Mike D & MCA]
Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job's ain't a job, it's a damn good time
City to city, I'm running my rhymes
On location, touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm illing and able
Ain't no faking, your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast watching all the girlies shaking
While you're at the job working nine-to-five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kicking it live

[Chorus]
No sleep till
Another plane, another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl, another fight
Another drive all night

[Verse 2: Mike D, MCA & Ad Rock]
Our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world, you rock around the clock
Plane to hotel, girls on the jock
We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
Getting paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back 'cause he's sleeping with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
White boys got more rhymes

No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn

Ain't seen the light since we started this band
So, MCA, get on the mic, my man!

Born and bred Brooklyn USA
They call me Adam Yauch but I'm MCA
Like a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Got limos, arena, and TV shows
Autograph pictures and classy hoes
Step off, Holmes, get out of my way!
Taxing little girlies from here to L.A.
Waking up before I get to sleep
'Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week

Don't ever last

Don't like no one

Of breaking glass
And if you don't believe me
Why did you ask?

I like leaving town
And coming back home
I'm going to show ya
When we're all alone

And I like
Staying up all night
Watching old movies
Until the morning light

I don't pretend to know
What's right or wrong
But I won't like leaving
If I stay here too long

'Cause the more something changes
The more it stays the same

Take it easy sometimes
But I can be stubborn
When I've made up my mind

[Verse 1]
That's great, it starts with an earthquake
Birds and snakes, an aeroplane
Lenny Bruce is not afraid
Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt, no, strength
The ladder starts to clatter with fear of height, down, height
Wire in a fire, representing seven games
And a government for hire and a combat site
Left of west and coming in a hurry
With the Furies breathing down your neck
Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
Look at that low plane, fine, then
Uh oh, overflow, population, common food
But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
Tell me with the Rapture and the reverent in the right, right
You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
Feeling pretty psyched

[Chorus]
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's the)
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's the)
It's the end of the world as we know it
And I feel fine

[Verse 2]
Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform, book burning, blood letting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a votive, step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crushed, uh-oh
This means no fear, cavalier renegade and steering clear
A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives, and I decline

[Chorus]
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it
(It's time I had some time alone)
It's the end of the world as we know it

The other night I dreamt of knives, continental drift divide Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein
Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom!
You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck
Right? Right!

I should have known better than to let you go alone
It's times like these I can't make it on my own
Wasted days and sleepless nights
And I can't wait to see you again
I find I spend my time waiting on your call
How can I tell you babe? Back's against the wall
I Need you by my side to tell me, ""It's alright""
'Cause I don't think I can take anymore
Is this love that Im feeling?
Is this the love that Ive been searching for?
Is this love or am I dreaming?
This must be love cause its really got a hold on me
A hold on me
I can't stop the feeling, Ive been this way before
But with you Ive found the key to open any door
I can feel my love for you growing stronger day by day
And I can't wait to see you again

320,Paper In Fire,The Lonesome Jubilee,John Mellencamp,1987,231200,51,"

She had a dream
And boy it was a good one
So she chased after her dream
With much desire

But when she got too close
To her expectations
Well the dream burned up
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Smokin' up the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder
Like paper in fire

He wanted love
With no involvement
So he chased the wind
That's all his silly life required

And the days of vanity
Went on forever
And he saw his days burn up
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Smokin' up the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder
Like paper in fire

There's a good life
Right across this green field
And each generation
Stares at it from afar

But we keep no check
On our appetites
So the green fields turn to brown
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Smokin' up the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder
Like paper in fire

Paper in fire
Stinkin' up the ashtrays
Paper in fire
Smokin' up the alleyways
Who's to say the way
A man should spend his days
Do you let them smolder

What are those words whispered, baby, just as you turn away
I saw you last night out on the edge of town
I wanna read your mind to know just what I've got in this new thing I've found

[Chorus]
So tell me what I see when I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

I heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow
Well I've tried so hard, baby, but I just can't see
What a woman like you is doing with me

So tell me who I see when I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart

I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

Now you play the loving woman, I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close into the palm of my hand
We stood at the altar, the gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours, well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied

So when you look at me, you better look hard and look twice

They came for him one winter's night
Arrested, he was bound
They said there'd been a robbery
His pistol had been found

They marched him to the station house
He waited till the dawn
And as they led him to the dock
He knew that he'd been wronged
""You stand accused of robbery,""
He heard the bailiff say
He knew without an alibi
Tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom

Over the hills and far away
For ten long years he'll count the days
Over the mountains and the seas
A prisoner's life for him there'll be

He knew that it would cost him dear
But yet he dare not say
Just where he'd been that fateful night
A secret it must stay
He had to fight back tears of rage
His heart beat like a drum
For with the wife of his best friend
He spent his final night of freedom

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
Far from the mountains and the seas
Back in her arms again he'll be
Over the hills and far away

Over the hills and
Over the hills and
Over the hills and far away

Each night within his prison cell
He looks out through the bars
He reads the letters that she wrote
One day he'll know the taste of freedom

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the seas
Back in his arms again she'll be

Over the hills and far away
He swears he will return one day
As sure as the river reach the seas
Back in his arms is where she'll be

Over the hills and far away
She prays he will return one day
As sure as the rivers reach the sea
Back in her arms is where he'll be

Tragic life on the wild side
Wild side, wild side
Kicking ass on the wild side
No going back on the wild side

And I feel a change in my life

Little child dry your crying eyes
How can I explain the fear you feel inside
Cause you were born into this evil world
Where man is killing man and no one knows just why
What have we become just look what we have done
All that we destroyed you must build again

When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

[Verse 2:]
Little child you must show the way
To a better day for all the young
Cause you were born for all the world to see
That we all can live with love and peace
No more presidents and all the wars will end
One united world under God

When the children cry let them know we tried
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

What have we become just look what we have done

When the children fight let them know it ain't right
When the children pray let them know the way
Cause when the children sing then the new world begins

Well I lived on the outskirts of town
In an eight room farmhouse, baby
When my brothers and friends were around
There was always somethin' doin'
Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends
Stopped by to see me every once in a while
When I think back about those days
All I can do is sit and smile

That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young and we were improvin'
Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby
Outside the club""Cherry Bomb""
Our hearts were really thumpin'
Say yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah

The winter days they last forever
But the weekends went by so quick
Went ridin' around this little country town
We were goin' nuts, girl, out in the sticks
One night, me with my big mouth
A couple guys had to put me in my place
When I see those guys these days
We just laugh and say do you remember when

I'm surprised that we're still livin'
If we've done any wrong
I hope that we're forgiven
Got a few kids of my own
And some days I still don't know what to do
I hope that they're not laughing too loud
When they hear me talkin'
Like this to you

He says, ""I love your work, babe, but you're just not what we're looking for""
It's never what, but who it is you know
So easy to get stuck in all that California snow, oh no

And a little bit of something can look awfully good to you
And you wanna scream, but you gotta keep it all inside
When you're trying to make a living, there ain't no such thing as pride, oh no

Lots of promises in the dark
Don't you open your heart

No, it don't mean nothing
No victim, no crime

Woke up from where she was lyin' still

Bitter the taste in my mouth

Under a black belly of cloud in the rain

She will suffer the needle chill

On a cold night in a hotel in New Orleans
Came the final blow
And somehow somewhere we lost sight
In our search for that pot of gold

And all that happened I don't understand
Could somebody here, somebody please explain to me
Cause I'm feeling so damn deceived

And I can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately
Theatre of my soul play on child

Ashes to ashes, light the good Lord lays us down
Dust to dust, oh, no
The time has come to lay to rest the years
All the years it took this heart to trust

Maybe too much too soon, I couldn't get my head on straight
All that worry, just wasted time
And now it's much too late to save it

Long forgotten midnight dancer
Plays her final role
The curtain falls and I'm still standing
Theatre of my soul you left in vain
Could someone please explain, and I said

I know that nothing's the same
Riding blind on the winds of change
But in my head that scene just keeps on playing

Long forgotten midnight dancer
Plays her final role, oh, yes she does
Can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately
The curtain falls and I'm still standing
In the theatre of my soul
Can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately
When time it just keeps on passing
I got to let it go, let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Can't run, can't hide, can't get nothing right lately
I keep searching for those long lost answers
In the theatre of my soul
Theatre of my soul

361,When Love Comes To Town,Rattle And Hum,U2,1988-10-10,254266,53,"

I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
I was under the waves before love rescued me
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

I ran into a juke-joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazed and in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

(Lost lyrical stanza)
When I woke up I was sleeping on the street
I felt the world was dancing, and I was dirt beneath their feet
When I woke up I saw the Devil looking down
But my Lord He played guitar the day love came to town

She stepped off the bus out into the city streets
Just a small town girl with her whole life
Packed in a suitcase by her feet

But somehow the lights didn't
Shine as bright as they did
On her mama's TV screen

And the work seemed harder
And the days seemed longer
Than she ever thought they'd be

But you know you got to stick to your guns
When it all comes down
Cause sometimes you can't choose
It's like heads they win
Tails you're gonna lose

[Chorus]
Win big--Mama's fallen angel
Lose big--living out her lies
Wants it all--Mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

Now she found herself in the fast lane living day to day
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
And let her family slip away

Just like a lost soul
Caught up in the Hollywood scene
All the parties and the limousines

Such a good actress hiding all her pain
Trading her memories for fortune and fame

Just a step away from the edge of a fall
Caught between heaven and hell
Where's the girl I knew a year ago

Too much too soon
Or just a little too late
Cause when her ship came in
She wasn't there and it just wouldn't wait

I used to be now I'm not what you see, Lord I try
And now it seems all those dreams have come true, but they're passing me by
Some fast talkin' mama for a dollar put a smile on my face
I'm drivin' all night
I end up in the same old place

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright

And who's to care if I grow my hair to the sky
I'll take a wish and a prayer cross my fingers cause I always get by
Some fast talkin' jerk for a dollar wiped the smile off my face
I'm drivin' all night
Just to keep the rat in the race

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright

Sometimes I feel so old
Got my lights burnin' bright
But I'm lookin' pretty sold
Sometimes I feel so cold
So cold
Let's go

Got to get on home
My gypsy road can't take me home
My gypsy road can't take me home, t-t-take me

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on pushin' cause it feels alright

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home
I keep on p-p-pushin'

My gypsy road
My gypsy road
My gypsy road
My gypsy road

My gypsy road

My gypsy road can't take me home
I drive all night just to see the light
My gypsy road can't take me home

Another night slowly closes in
And I feel so lonely
Touching heat freezing on my skin
I pretend you still hold me
I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep
I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you
I can't believe you're gone
You were the first, you'll be the last

Wherever you go, I'll be with you
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you
Whenever you need someone
To lay your heart and head upon
Remember, after the fire, after all the rain
I will be the flame
I will be the flame

Watching shadows move across the wall
I feel so frightened
I wanna run to you, I wanna call
But I've been hit by lightning
Just can't stand up for fallin' apart
Can't see through this veil across my heart, over you
You'll always be the one
You were the first, you'll be the last

Tonight I feel so weak
But all in love is fair
I turn the other cheek
And I feel the slap and the sting
Of the foul night air
And I know
You're only human
And I haven't got
Talking room
But tonight while I'm making excuses
Some other woman
Is making love to you

Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see I'm burning alive?
Can't you see my baby's
Got another lover?
I don't know how I'm gonna survive
Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see it's out of control?
Baby's got my heart
And my baby's got my mind
But tonight the sweet Devil
Sweet Devil's got my soul

When will this aching pass?
When will this night be through?
I want to hear the breaking glass
I only feel the steel
Of the red hot truth
And I'd do anything
To get it out of my mind
I need some insanity
Of that temporary kind
Tell me how will I ever be the same
When I know that woman
Is whispering your name

Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see I'm burning alive?
Can't you see my baby's
Got another lover?

372,Tweeter And The Monkey Man,"The Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1",Traveling Wilburys,1988-10-18,327853,53,"

[Verse 1: Bob Dylan]
Tweeter and the Monkey Man were hard up for cash
They stayed up all night selling cocaine and hash
To an undercover cop who had a sister named Jan
For reasons unexplained, she loved the Monkey Man

Tweeter was a boy scout 'fore she went to Vietnam
And found out the hard way nobody gives a damn
They knew that they'd find freedom just across the Jersey Line
So they hopped into a stolen car, took Highway 99

[Chorus]
And the walls came down, all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

[Verse 2: Bob Dylan]
The undercover cop never liked the Monkey Man
Even back in childhood, he wanted to see him in the can
Jan got married at fourteen to a racketeer named Bill
She made secret calls to the Monkey Man from a mansion on the hill

It was out on Thunder Road, Tweeter at the wheel
They crashed into paradise, they could hear them tires squeal
The undercover cop pulled up and said ""Everyone of you's a liar
If you don't surrender now, it's gonna go down to the wire""

[Chorus]
And the walls came down, all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

[Verse 3: Bob Dylan]
An ambulance rolled up, a state trooper close behind
Tweeter took his gun away and messed up his mind
The undercover cop was left tied up to a tree
Near the souvenir stand by the old abandoned factory

Next day, the undercover cop was hot in pursuit
He was taking the whole thing personal, he didn't care about the loot
Jan had told him many times it was you to me who taught
In Jersey, anything's legal as long as you don't get caught

[Chorus]
And the walls came down, all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

[Verse 4: Bob Dylan]
Someplace by Rahway Prison, they ran out of gas
The undercover cop had cornered 'em, said, ""Boy, you didn't think that this could last""
Jan jumped up out of bed, said, ""There's someplace I gotta go""
She took a gun out of the drawer and said, ""It's best if you don't know""

The undercover cop was found face-down in a field
The Monkey Man was on the river bridge using Tweeter as a shield
Jan said to the Monkey Man, ""I'm not fooled by Tweeter's curl
I knew him long before he ever became a Jersey girl""

[Chorus]
And the walls came down, all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

[Verse 5: Bob Dylan]
Now the town of Jersey City is quieting down again
I'm sitting in a gambling club called A Lion's Den
The TV set was blown up, every bit of it is gone
Ever since the nightly news show that the Monkey Man was on

I guess I'll go to Florida and get myself some sun
There ain't no more opportunity here, everything been done
Sometimes I think of Tweeter, sometimes I think of Jan
Sometimes I don't think about nothing but the Monkey Man

[Chorus]
And the walls came down, all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

[Chorus]
And the walls came down, all the way to hell
Never saw them when they're standing
Never saw them when they fell

I can't clear my heart of your love

Tearing through my soul I just can't

Reflections in my mind
Thoughts I can't define
My heart is racing and the night goes on
I can almost hear a laugh
Coming from your photograph
Funny how a look can share a thousand meanings
Well intended lies, contemplating alibi's
Is it really you or is it me, I'm blaming?
A distant memory, flashes over me
Even though you're gone I feel you deep inside

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh)
Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes

[Chorus]
I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through loving you, girl

[Verse 2]
There's a window in the heart
I've tried to look through from the start
You're never really sure what someone else is thinking
Someone's broken something new
Another altered point of view
Just a certain someone's conscience playing

I had it in my hand, I did not understand
What lives inside the wind that cries her name
Tried to catch a shooting star
What seems so close can't be that far
Living in a dream that's never ending

[Pre-Chorus]
Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes

I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few

Mm, come to my place, we can talk it over
Oh, everythin' goin' down in your head
She said, ""Take it easy, I need some time
Time to work it out, to make you mine""

And just when I thought
She was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet
And brought me to the floor

She said, ""I'm only seventeen (seventeen)
You ain't seen love
Ain't seen nothin' like me""
She's only seventeen, seventeen, yeah, yeah

Yeah, such a bad girl, loves to work me overtime
Feels good dancin' close to the borderline
She's a magic mountain, she's a leather glove
Oh, she's my soul, it must be love

She's only seventeen (Seventeen)
Girl she gives me love like I've never seen
She's only seventeen (Seventeen)

All alone now, except for the memories
Of what we had and what we knew
Everytime I try to leave it behind me
I see something that reminds me of you

Every night the dreams return to haunt me
Your rosary wrapped around your throat
I lie awake and sweat, afraid to fall asleep
I see your face looking back at me, looking back at me...

And I raise my head and stare into the eyes of a stranger
I've always known that the mirror never lies
People always turn away from the eyes of a stranger
Afraid to know what lies behind the stare

Is this all that's left of my life before me
Straight jacket memories, sedative highs
No happy ending like they've always promised
There's got to be something left for me

And I raise my head and stare into the eyes of a stranger
I've always known that the mirror never lies
People always turn away from the eyes of a stranger
Afraid to know what lies behind the stare (lies behind my stare)

How many times must I live this tragedy?
How many more lies will they tell me?
All I want is the same as everyone
Why am I here, and for how long?

And I raise my head and stare into the eyes of a stranger
I've always known that the mirror never lies
People always turn away from the eyes of a stranger
Afraid to know what lies behind the stare

I remember now!

Somewhere deep inside
Something's got a hold on you
And it's pushing me aside
See it stretch on forever

And I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

Stripping back the coats
Of lies and deceiption
Back to nothingness
Like a week in the desert

And I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

So don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong
Cos when you get back home maybe I'll be gone

When the nights go down
When you've had your fill
When there's nothing left

It would cause me pain
If we were to end it
But I could start again
You can depend on it

I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

Heaven is in the palm of my hand and it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy?

Sometimes it's hard to hold on so hard to hold on to my dreams

And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me in
Your warm and darkened grave?

[Verse 1]
From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No one asks us how we like to be
In school, they teach you what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see

[Pre-Chorus]
So, they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point, you give it up
So, the only thing that's left to think is this:

[Chorus]
I want out—to live my life alone
I want out—leave me be
I want out—to do things on my own
I want out—to live my life and to be free

[Verse 2]
People tell me ""A"" and ""B""
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So, they push me, then, from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing till there's nothing more to hear

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
'Cause I decide the way things gonna be

[Chorus]
I want out—to live my life alone
I want out—leave me be
I want out—to do things on my own
I want out—to live my life and to be free

[Bridge]
There's a million ways (Million ways) to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool (Million ways)
In the end of it (In the end), none of us is right
Sometimes, we need to be alone (Alone, alone, alone)

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

To live my life alone

When I was just a kid
When friends were friends forever
And what you said was what you did
Well, it was me and Danny and Bobby
We cut each other's hands
And held tight to a promise
Only brothers understand

But were so young (So young)
One for all and all for one (For one)

Well, Bobby was our hero
Because he had a fake ID
I got busted stealing cigarettes
And he took the rap for me
Danny knew this white trash girl
We each threw in a ten
She took us to this cheap motel
And turned us into men

Danny, he's a medicine man

Through the years and miles between us
It's been a long and lonely ride
But if I got that call in the dead of the night
I would be right by your side

To satisfy your senses?

You have to climb some fences
Scratching and crawling
Along the floor to touch you
And just when it feels right
You say you found someone to hold you
Does she like I do?

Baby, tell me does she love you
Like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you?
Attract and captivate you?
Tell me, does she miss you?
Existing just to kiss you?
Like the way I do?

Tell me, does she want you?
Infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you?
Electrify and rock you?
Does she inject you?
Seduce you and affect you?

Can I survive
All the implications?

Could you be less than an addiction?

Who would beg steal and lie
Fight kill and die

Hold you like I do?

Who fight it out most nights
Then pray for God's forgiveness
When they both turn out the lights
Or wear that ring of diamonds

You stay together but alone
Or is it right to hold you
And kiss your lips goodnight

If you sign it on the dotted line

[Verse 1]
Your cruel device, your blood like ice
One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

[Chorus]
I wanna love you, but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

[Verse 2]
Your mouth, so hot, your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet, black lace on sweat

[Chorus]
I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you but you're under my skin (deep in)
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins

[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

[Outro]
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

There’s colors on the street
Red, white, and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes

There’s a warning sign on the road ahead
There’s a lot of people saying we’d be better off dead
Don’t feel like Satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
There's an old street light
Near a garbage can

Now she put the kid away and she’s gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what she’s done to it
There’s one more kid that’ll never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
We've got department stores and toilet paper
Got Styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

Keep on rockin' in the free world

Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass
It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight

But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet

Under the arc of a weather stain boards
Ancient goblins and warlords
Come out of the ground, not making a sound
The smell of death is all around
And the night when the cold wind blows
No one cares, nobody knows

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again

Follow Victor to the sacred place
This ain't a dream, I can't escape
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
Spirits moaning among the tombstones
And the night, when the moon is bright
Someone cries, something ain't right

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary

The moon is full, the air is still
All of a sudden I feel a chill
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away
Skeletons dance, I curse this day
And the night when the wolves cry out
Listen close and you can hear me shout

I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't wanna be buried in a pet sematary

When love went blind and you would make me see

Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
The boy could sing
Knew how to move, everything
Always wanting more
He'd leave you longing for

And that little boy's smile
Black velvet
With that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Up in Memphis
The music's like a heatwave
White lightning
Bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every schoolgirl
""Love Me Tender"" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle

The way he moved
It was a sin
So sweet and true
Always wanting more

It happened so soon
What could you do?

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
What time, oh oh oh oh

[Verse]
We could sail away
Or catch a freight train
Or a rocketship into outer space
Nothin' left to do
Too many things were said
To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did
Seasons must change
Separate paths, separate ways
If we blame it on anything
Let's blame it on the rain
I knew it all along
I'd have to write this song
Too young to fall in love
Guess we knew it all along

That's alright, that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, that's okay
Let's turn the page

My friends called today
Down from L.A
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away

That's alright, that's okay
We were two kids in love
Trying to find our way
Thats's alright, that's okay
Held our dreams in our hands
Let our minds run away
That's alright, that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, let's turn the page
And remember what I say girl
And it goes this way

Don't go away now

[Verse 1]
Somewhere out in the back of your mind (Somewhere)
Comes your real life and the life that you know
It seems like it was the creation of some of those same old things
It seemed to be the only thing left out in the light
She had trusted many...
But been unfamiliar with...
Almost everyone but you

[Chorus]
Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself...
I have known this much longer than I've known you

[Verse 2]
She had trusted many...
And then there would be someone who would enter into her presence
That she could sense for miles...
She dreamed of her wanton luxury
And she laughed and she cried... and she tried to taunt him
And he hated to be separated...
From that picture... No...

Well maybe I'm just thinking that the rooms are all on fire
Everytime that you walk in the room
Well there is magic all around you, if I do say so myself...

Well the times are getting hard for you, little girl
I'm a humming and a strumming all over God's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line

Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're looking tired, you're looking kind of beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Half way home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was giving what she got

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

Woman you're a mess going to die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messing around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town

You didn't know that rock and roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

I didn't know you had a rock and roll record
Until i saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now, it's dark and you're gone

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

So shy, so shy, so shy, so shy
So shy, so shy, so shy, so shy

I spy something beginning with 's'

On candy stripe legs, the spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim, shivering in bed

Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly, a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do, and I realize with fright
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs, shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes

""Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight""

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the spiderman is always hungry

""Come into my parlour"" said the spider to the fly
""I have something""

Went down to the station, and he never came back
They found his clothing scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning

But men get lost sometimes as years unfurl
One day, he crossed some line, and he was too much in this world

Pulled my coat around my shoulders, took a walk down through the park
Leaves were falling around me, groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock, a desperate lover left his mark
""Baby, I've changed, please come back""

What the head makes cloudy, the heart makes very clear
I know the days were so much brighter in the time when she was here
I know that somebody somewhere can make these dark clouds disappear
But until that day, I have to believe, I believe, I believe

She was his possession like a jewel on his crown

Say your prayers, 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart, 'cause you're playing with fire

Tito looked for Johnny with a vengeance and a gun

With nothing won
When someone lies dying
Lovers finally understand

Woman in chains
Woman in chains

[Verse 3: Oleta Adams, Roland Orzabal]
Trades her soul as skin and bone
You better love loving and you better behave
Sells the only thing she owns
You better love loving and you better behave
Woman in chains
The sun and the moon
Woman in chains

[Interlude: Roland Orzabal]
Men of stone
Men of stone

[Chorus 2: Roland Orzabal, Oleta Adams, Both]
Well, I feel deep in your heart there are wounds time can't heal
That time can't heal
And I feel somebody somewhere is trying to breathe
Well, you know what I mean
It's a world gone crazy
Keeps woman in chains

[Post-Chorus: Roland Orzabal, Oleta Adams, Both]
It's under my skin but out of my hands
I'll tear it apart, but I won't understand
Somebody somewhere is trying to breathe
I will not accept the greatness of man

[Interlude: Roland Orzabal, Oleta Adams]
It's a world gone crazy
Keeps woman in chains
Gone crazy
Keeps woman in chains

[Outro: Both, Roland Orzabal]
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
The sun and the moon
So free her
The wind and the rain
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
So free her
The sun and the moon
So free her
The wind and the rain
So free her

I can feel the earth begin to move
I hear my needle hit the groove
And spiral through another day
I hear my song begin to say
Kiss me where the sun don't shine
The past was yours
But the future's mine
You're all out of time
I, don't feel too steady on my feet steady on my feet
I feel hollow I feel weak
Passion foods and holy bread
Fill my guts and ease my head
Through the early morning sun
I can see her here she comes
She bangs the drums
Have you seen her, have you heard
The way she plays there are no words
To describe the way I feel
How could it ever come to pass
She'll be the first, she'll be the last
To describe the way I feel
The way I feel
Have you seen her, have you heard
The way she plays there are no words
To describe the way I feel
How could it ever come to pass
She'll be the first, she'll be the last
To describe the way I feel
The way I feel
Have you seen her have you heard
The way she plays there are no words
To describe the way I feel
How could it ever come to pass
She'll be the first, she'll be the last
To describe the way I feel
The way I feel

430,The End Of The Innocence,The End Of The Innocence,Don Henley,1989-06-27,316360,55,"

Remember when the days were long
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standin' by
But ""happily ever after"" fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly

Oh, but I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by men
Sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details
Since daddy had to lie

Oh, but I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass waves in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

[Instrumental bridge]

Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast
But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye

Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence

Oh nah nah
Naaah

[Verse 1]
She's got an alligator bag
Top hat to match
Dressed in black on black
She's got a Filipino girlie
She claims is her friend
I tell you boys, you just gotta laugh
Now I used to call her Cindy
She changed her name to ""Sin""
I guess that's the name of her game
Yeah, I really used to love her
Then, the kitty she discovered
It's got to be a sexual thing

[Chorus]
Now all around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain

[Post-Chorus]
I say no, no, no
No, no, no
(Introduce me)

[Verse 2]
Introduced me to her lover
In a cellophane dress
Then they bid me a sweet farewell
Last time I saw them
They were kissing so softly
To the sound of wedding bells

[Chorus]
Well, all around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain
It's the same old, same old situation

It's the same old, same old ball and chain

All around the world
Girls will be girls

It's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain
I tell you girl, it's the same old, same old situation
It's the same old, same old ball and chain, yeah
Yeah, no-no

Sometimes I wonder
How I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue

'Cause sometimes it seems
Like this world is closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me

Sometimes I want to give up, wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you, baby
And everything's alright
Everything's alright

[Chorus]
When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile, see a ray of light
Oh, see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby, when I see you smile at me, oh yeah

Baby, there's nothing
In this world that could ever do
What the touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew, hey

And when the rain is falling I don't feel it
'Cause you're here with me now
I want your answer baby
It's all I'll ever need
It's all I'll ever need

[Chorus]
When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light
Oh, I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile, baby
Baby, when I see you smile at me

Sometimes I want to give up
I wanna give in, I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you, baby
And everything's alright
Hey, everything's alright, so right

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything, yeah
When I see you smile, I see a ray of light

Oh, you know I can do anything now
When I see you smile, oh yeah
Baby, when I see you smile
Smile at me

[Verse 1]
I got to tell you what I'm feeling inside, I could lie to myself, but it's true
There's no denying when I look in your eyes, girl I'm out of my head over you
I lived so long believin' all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time

It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever, until my life is thru, girl I'll be loving you forever

I hear the echo of a promise I made
When you're strong you can stand on your own
But those words grow distant as I look at your face
No, I don't want to go it alone
I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
But everything about you is telling me this time

[Chorus]
It's forever, this time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever, until my life is thru, girl I'll be loving you forever

Yeah!

I see my future when I look in your eyes
It took your love to make my heart come alive
Because I lived my life believing all love is blind
But everything about you is telling me this time

Forever, until my life is thru, girl I'll be loving you forever
