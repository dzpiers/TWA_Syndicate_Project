1,All Out of Love,Lost in Love,Air Supply,1980-02-25,243000,66,"

[Verse 1]
I'm lyin' alone with my head on the phone
Thinkin' of you till it hurts
I know you're hurt too, but
What else can we do
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know
Doesn't really know

[Chorus]
I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong

[Verse 2]
I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long, lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too
Does the feeling seem oh so right
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone
I'll be gone

[Chorus]
I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong

[Bridge]
Oh, what are you thinkin' of?
What are you thinkin' of?
What are you thinkin' of?
What are you thinkin' of?

[Chorus]
I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
I know I was so wrong

[Chorus]
I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
I know I was so wrong

[Chorus]
I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong

2,The Winner Takes It All,Super Trouper,ABBA,1980,294720,73,"

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[Chorus]
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2]
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

[Chorus]
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)

[Verse 3]
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

[Chorus]
The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

[Verse 4]
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

[Bridge]
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

[Outro]
(So the winner)
(Takes it all)
(And the loser)
(Has to fall)
(Throw a dice)
(Cold as ice)
(Way down here)
(Someone dear)
(Takes it all)
(Has to fall)
(It seems plain)
(Why complain)

4,9 to 5,9 To 5 And Odd Jobs,Dolly Parton,1980,162466,75,"

[Verse 1]
Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

[Chorus]
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

[Verse 2]
They let you dream just to watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way

[Chorus]
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his wallet
9 to 5, what a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it

Ooh, let's go!

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain’t no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you’re gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

8,Don't Stand So Close To Me,Zenyatta Mondatta (Remastered 2003),The Police,1980-10-03,242666,68,"

[Verse 1]
Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Bookmarking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

[Chorus]
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

[Verse 2]
Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry

[Chorus]
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

[Verse 3]
Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in
That book by Nabokov

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
Before I put another notch in my lipstick case
You better make sure you put me in my place

Hit me with your best shot
C'mon, hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

I was born the son of a lawless man
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind

To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old

I'm on the run
No time to sleep

To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Still I don't remember

And we're still together

Friday night, I crashed your party
Saturday, I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said, take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy
Some madness for a while

[Verse 4]
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose

Caught like a wildfire out of control

How she swore that it never would end

Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
Found myself further and further from my home and I

[Verse 4: Bob Seger]
I guess I lost my way, there were oh so many roads
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live
Never worried about payin' or even how much I owe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Bob Seger]
Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
I'm older now but still running against the wind

30,It's Still Rock and Roll to Me,Glass Houses,Billy Joel,1980-03-12,176440,66,"

[Verse 1]
What's the matter with
The clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some
Old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been
Hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy
Till you spend a lot of money

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 2]
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set
Of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise
The miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true
Baby blue Continental

[Chorus]
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

[Bridge]
Oh, it doesn't matter
What they say in the papers
Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

[Verse 4]
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money
On a new set of speakers
You get more mileage
From a cheap pair of sneakers

[Chorus]
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

[Saxophone solo]

[Verse 5]
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about
The new fashion honey?
All you need are looks
And a whole lotta money

[Chorus]
It's the next phase, new wave
Dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

And now we lead our separate lives

Driving alone to a movie show
So I turn to the sounds in my car

There's a band playing on the radio
With a rhythm of rhyming guitars
There's a band playing on the radio
And it's drowning the sound of my tears
They're playing ""oh yeah"" on the radio
Ohh oh ohh oh ohh

Having fun and playing fools
Smashing up the woodwork tools

All the teachers in the pub
Passing round the ready rub
Trying not to think of when
The lunchtime bell will ring again

Oh what fun we had
But did it really turn out bad
All i learnt at school
Was how to bend not break the rules
Oh what fun we had
But at the time it seemed so bad
Trying different ways to
Make a difference to

The headmaster's had enough today
All the kids have gone away
Gone to fight with next door's school
Every term that is the rule
Sits alone and bends his cane
Same old backsides again
All the small ones tell tall tales
Walking home and squashing snails

Lots of girls and lots of boys
Lots of smells and lots of noise
Playing football in the park
Kicking pushbikes after dark
Baggy trousers dirty shirt
Pulling hair and eating dirt

Back of the head with a plastic cup

Baggy trousers

High school sweethearts, love was so brand new

In our hearts, girl and in our minds
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl, when you lose

[Chorus]
Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
What a mess we've made
So long ago
You were my love
Feeling
The pain

So, so hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
Oh, gotta cool this mess we've made
It's so, so hot, baby (too hot)
Yes it's so hot (too hot)
I just can't take it
I can't stand no more, baby
We were once lovers (too hot)
We took our vows (too hot)
A man and wife
Forever
Oh (too hot)
(too hot)
Baby (too hot)
Please won't you listen (too hot)
It hurt me so bad
But I know I've got to leave
(Too hot)
It's too hot (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter, baby
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
It's so, so hot, baby (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
Gotta cool this mess we've made
It's so warm (too hot)
It's so warm (too hot)
It's hot baby, yeah
Gotta run for shade
Come on (too hot)
I'm leaving (too hot)
Goodbye

45,It's My Turn,To Love Again,Diana Ross,1981-02-17,236026,43,"

I can't cover up my feelings
In the name of love
Or play it safe
For a while that was easy

And if living for myself
Is what I'm guilty of
Go on and sentence me
I'll still be free

It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
This time's just for me

Because it's my turn
With no apologies
I've given up the truth
To those I've tried to please

But now it's my turn
If I don't have all the answers
At least I know
I'll take my share of chances
Ain't no use of holding of
When nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain
Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
Though I know it won't be easy

It's my turn
With no more room for lies
For years I'd seen my life
Through someone else's eyes

And now it's my turn
To try and find my way
And if I should get lost
At least I'll own today

It's my turn
Yes, it's my turn
And there ain't no use in holding of
When nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain
Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
Though I know it won't be easy

It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
This time's just for me

Because it's my turn
To turn and say goodbye
I sure would like to know
That you're still on my side

Because it's my turn
It's my turn

It's my turn
To start from number one
Trying to undo
Some damage that's been done

But now it's my turn
To reach and touch the sky
No one's gonna say
At least I didn't try

It's my turn
Yes, it's my turn

It's my turn
It's my turn
It's my turn

[Verse 1]
Someone found a letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered too
If, by chance, you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Now, now, don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, it kinda made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air

If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in, you may find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud, they said it really loud

On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Let it be soon don't hesitate
Make it now don't wait
Open your heart and let my love come in
I want the moment to start
When I can fill your heart with

More love and more joy

To live it down
Wear it down
Tear it down

This is no fiction this is no act
This is real it's a fact

Each day I'll be living to
Make sure I'm giving you

It'll take a hundred life times
To live it down
Wear it down

As we grow older no need to fear
When you need me
I'll be beside you every step of the way
A heart that's truthful
And keeping you youthful with

More love and more joy

Some people might say my life is in a rut
I'm quite happy with what I got
People might say that I should strive for more
But I'm so happy I can't see the point

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Something's happening here today
A show of strength with your boy's brigade
And I'm so happy and you're so kind
You want more money - of course, I don't mind
To buy nuclear textbooks for atomic crimes
And the public gets what the public wants
But I want nothing this society's got

I'm going underground (going underground)
Well, let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
Going underground (going underground)
Well, let the boys all sing and let the boys all shout for tomorrow

Some people might get some pleasure out of hate
Me, I've enough already on my plate
People might need some tension to relax
Me, I'm too busy dodging between the flak

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What you see is what you get
You made your bed, you better lie in it
You choose your leaders and place your trust
As their lies puts you down and their promises rust
You'll see kidney machines replaced by rockets and guns
And the public wants what the public gets
But I don't get what this society wants

Well, let the brass bands play and feet start to pound
Going underground (going underground)

Longer than
There've been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there`ve been
Stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you

Stronger than
Any mountain cathedral
Truer than any tree ever grew
Deeper than
Any forest primeval
I am in love with you

I'll bring fire in the winters
You'll send showers in the springs
We`ll fly through
The falls and summers
With love on our wings

Through the years
As the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines
In the book of our lives

Though the binding cracks
And the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you
I'll be in love with you

Longer than
There`ve been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than
There`ve been stars up in the heavens
I`ve been in love with you

[Verse 1]
She wanted to test her husband
She knew exactly what to do:
A pseudonym to fool him
She couldn't have made a worse move
She sent him scented letters
And he received them with a strange delight
Just like his wife
But how she was before the tears
And how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she was beautiful
She signed the letter:

[Chorus]
""All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya""

She wanted to take it further
So she arranged a place to go
To see if he
Would fall for her incognito
And when he laid eyes on her
He got the feeling they had met before
Uncanny how she
Reminds him of his little lady
Capacity to give him all he needs
Just like his wife before she freezed on him
Just like his wife when she was beautiful
He shouted out:

[Chorus]
""I'm all yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya

Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun

Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn

You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
Because we all just made a pact

Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

Don't you stop the music, oh no

Nobody told you Oh, Oh, Oh, you

[Verse 1]
Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

[Verse 2]
He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun""

[Chorus]
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

[Verse 3]
There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace, took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again

[Chorus]
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

[Verse 4]
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look, old yella's leavin'""
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, ""This one's for Becky"" as he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say

[Chorus 2]
I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And Papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man

Everyone considered him the coward of the county

Stay for just a while
Stay and let me look at you
It's been so long, I hardly knew you
Standing in the door

Stay with me a while
I only wanna talk to you
We've traveled halfway 'round the world
To find ourselves again

September morn
We danced until the night
Became a brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way

Look at what you've done
Why, you've become a grown-up girl
I still can hear you crying
In a corner of your room
And look how far we've come
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've forgotten
How it was before

September morn
Do you remember
How we danced that night away
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic play
September morning
Still can make me feel that way

We danced until the night
Became a brand new day

From some romantic play

Still can make me feel that way

If someone tells you there's no other form of life
And you believe in them too
I'm gonna tell you 'bout the other night
I swear that it's true
A cloud of white, and green, and flying ships
I've never seen
Came into my view

Was I frightened? Was I scared? Was I thrown into confussion?
As they glided down so silently, it wasn't an illusion
No no
No doubt about it
Oh no
No doubt about it

What kind of magnetism kept me in this place?
Was it out of my control?
What was the ship from outer space?
What was this creature that appeared before my eyes?
Was it good? Was it evil?
On the ship from other skies

I was frightened. I was Scared. I was thrown into confussion
As they stood right there in front of me
It wasn't an illusion
No no
No doubt about it
Oh no
No doubt about it

They stood right there infront of me
What can they be?
No illusion
No no doubt about it
Oh no
No doubt about it
Oh no
No doubt about it
Oh no
No doubt about it
No no
No ain't no doubt
Ain't no doubt
No no

Who's goin' to ride that chrome three-wheeler?
Who's goin' to make that first mistake?
Who wants to wear those gypsy leathers
All the way to Fire Lake?

Who wants to break the news about Uncle Joe?
You remember Uncle Joe
He was the one afraid to cut the cake
Who wants to tell poor Aunt Sarah
Joe's run off to Fire Lake?
Joe's run off to Fire Lake

Who wants to brave those bronzed beauties
Lyin' in the sun
With their long soft hair falling
Flying as they run
Ah they smile so shy and they flirt so well
And they lay you down so fast
Till you look straight up and say
Oh lord, am I really here at last?

Who wants to play those eights and aces?
Who wants a raise, who needs a stake?
Who wants to take that long-shot gamble
And head out for Fire Lake?

Head out
Who wants to go to Fire Lake
Head out
Who wants to go to Fire Lake
Hey, head out
Who wants to go to Firelake
Head out, head out
Who wants to go to Fire Lake
Out to Fire Lake
All right! Who wants to do it?
Who wants to go to Fire Lake?

Who wants to do it?
Who wants to go to Fire Lake?
Who wants to do it now?
Who wants to go to Fire Lake?
Who wants to go to Fire Lake?
Hey, who wants to head out, head out?

[Verse 1]
It sounds so nice, what you're proposing
Just once or twice, and not disclosing
And not disclosin' how we're really really feeling

What you're proposing the other night
As I was leaving, I looks left and right
And not believing
And not believing that I'd finally be leaving

[Verse 3]
What you're proposing, now get it right
If I'm composing, but then I might
Be runny nosing
I might be runny runny runny runny nosing
But you're supposing

Don't be so sure, and just supposing
We yell for more, and compromising
And compromising leads to really really feeling

I'm only dreaming, it can't be long
I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming, dreaming, only only dreaming
Am I just supposing

Lady, I'm your knight in shining armor
And I love you
You have made me what I am and I am yours
My love, there's so many ways
I want to say I love you
Let me hold you in my arms forever more

You have gone and made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh, we belong together
Won't you believe in my song

Lady, for so many years
I thought I'd never find you
You have come into my life
And made me whole
Forever let me wake to see you each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear

In my eyes I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes, oh yes
I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long

Lady, your love's the only love I need
And beside me is where I want you to be
'Cause my love
There's something I want you to know
You're the love of my life
You're my lady

[Verse 1]
Over by the window
There's a pack of cigarettes
Not my brand, you understand
Sometimes the girl forgets
She forgets to hide them
I know who left those smokes behind
She'll say, ""Oh, he's just a friend""
And I'll say, ""Oh, I'm not blind"" to

[Chorus]
Him, him, him
What's she gonna do about him?
She's gonna have to do without him
Or do without me, me, me
No one gets to get it for free
It's me or it's him

[Verse 2]
Don't know what he looks like
Don't know who he is
Don't know why she thought that I
Would say ""What's mine is his""
I don't want to own her
But I can't let her have it both ways
Three is one too many of us
She leaves with me or stays with

[Chorus]
Him, him, him
What's she gonna do about him?
She's gonna have to do without him
Or do without me, me, me
No one gets to get it for free
It's me or it's him

[Verse 3]
If she wants him, she can have him
Just exactly how we once were
It's goodbye to he and I
And back to me and her without

[Chorus]
Him, him, him
What's she gonna do about him?
She's gonna have to do without him
Or do without me, me, me
No one gets to get it for free
Time for me to make the girl see
It's me or it's him, him, him
What's she gonna do about him?
She's gonna have to do without him
Or do without me, me, me
No one gets to get it for free
Time for me to make the girl see
It's me or it's him

I was all right for a while
I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say 'hello'
And though you wished to me well
You couldn't tell

That I'd been
Crying, over you
Crying, over you

Then you said so long
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying
Crying
Crying
Crying

It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I, was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more, than I did before
But, darling, what can I do

While you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying, over you
Crying, over you

Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying
(Crying)
Crying
(Crying)
Crying
(Crying)
Crying
Crying
Crying
Over you

While we're cruisin' around in the street
Listen up for the party in feet
Slap me five that's the place we've arrived, it's alive

Everybody take it to the top
We're gonna stomp, all night
In the neighborhood
Don't it feel alright?
Gonna stomp, all night
Wanna party, 'til the morning light

Mmm, runnin', runnin', runnin'

The set is hot, there's people wall to wall
Old ones, young things, short ones standing tall
So grab the one with the smile on her face
And hit the floor and stay right on the case
The heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone

Everybody take it to the top

They were dancing 'cross the floor, turning movement back and forth, they were lovers
One more lonely night for me, I looked up what did I see

Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes

Ooh your magic cast a spell, it didn't take long 'til we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be

Overnight scenes, dinner and wine
Saturday girls
I was never in love, never had the time
In my hustle and hurry world
Laughing myself to sleep
Waking up lonely
I needed someone to hold me oh oh oh

It's such a crazy old town
It can drag you down
Till you run out of dreams
So you party all night to the music and lights
But you don't know what happiness means
I was dancing in the dark with strangers
No love around me
When suddenly you found me oh oh oh

Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're my fantasy, you're my reality
Girl you're every woman in the world to me
You're everything I need, you're everything to me
Oh girl

Everything good, everything fine
That's what you are
So put your hand in mine
And together we'll climb
As high as the highest star
I'm living a lifetime in every minute
That we're together
And I'll stay right here forever oh oh oh

I didn't wanna see the film tonight
I found it hard to say
She thought I'd had enough of her
Why can't she see
She's lovely to me?
But I like to stay in
And watch TV on my own
Every now and then

My girl's mad at me
Been on the telephone for an hour
We hardly said a word
I tried and tried but I could not be heard
Why can't I explain?
Why do I feel this pain?
'Cause everything I say
She doesn't understand
She doesn't realise
She takes it all the wrong way

My girl's mad at me
We argued just the other night
I thought we'd got it straight
We talked and talked until it was light
I thought we'd agreed
I thought we'd talked it out
Now when I try to speak
She says that I don't care
She says I'm unaware
And now she says I'm weak

Base my whole existence on

It's not important for you to know my name
Nor I to know yours
If we communicate for two minutes only
It will be enough
For knowing that someone in this world
Feels as desperate as me
And what you give is what you get

It doesn't matter if we never meet again
What we have said will always remain
If we get through for two minutes only
It will be a start!
For knowing that someone in this life
Loves with a passion called hate
And what you give is what you get

If I never ever see you (if I never ever see you)
If I never ever see you (if I never ever see you)
If I never ever see you again

If I never ever see you (see you, see you, see you)
If I never ever see you (see you, see you, see you)
If I never ever see you again

And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get
And what you give is what you get

Crack that whip
Give the past a slip
Step on a crack
Break your momma's back

When a problem comes along
You must whip it
Before the cream sets out too long
You must whip it
When something's going wrong
You must whip it

Now whip it
Into shape
Shape it up
Get straight
Go forward
Move ahead
Try to detect it
It's not too late
To whip it
Whip it good

When a good time turns around
You must whip it
You will never live it down
Unless you whip it
No one gets away
Until they whip it

I say whip it
Whip it good
I say whip it
Whip it good

Crack that whip
Give the past a slip
Step on a crack

Soldier is turning
See him through white light
Running from strangers
See you in the valley

War upon war
Heat upon heat
To cut a long story short, I lost my mind

Sitting on a park bench
Years away from fighting
Ah, to cut a long story short, I lost my mind

Standing in the dark
Oh, I was waiting for men to come
I am beautiful and clean
And so very, very young
To be standing in the street
To be taken by someone

Standing in the dark
Oh, I was waiting for man to come
I am beautiful and clean
And so very very young
To be standing in the street
To be taken by someone

Questions, questions
Give me no answers

Questions, questions

Oh, look at the strange boy
He finds it hard existing
To cut a long story short, I lost my mind

Oh, to cut a long story short, I lost my...

Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because it's all on you

Don't you know by now
No one gives you anything?
And don't you wonder how you keep on moving?
One more day your way, oh your way

When there's no one left to leave you
Even you don't quite believe you
That's when nothing can deceive you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because it's all on you

Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

And that old gray wind is blowing
And there's nothing left worth knowing
And its time you should be going

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because it's all on you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it

While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance

While you see a chance take it

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me

You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?

[Verse 2: Susan Ann Sulley]
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me

[Verse 1: Stevie Nicks]
Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow
Shatter with words impossible to follow
You're saying I'm fragile, try not to be
I search only for something I can't see
I have my own life
And I am stronger than you know

[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

[Chorus: Stevie Nicks]
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave

[Verse 4: Don Henley]
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by
First time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by

[Chorus: Stevie Nicks & Don Henley]
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
Says something like, ""You and me babe, how about it?""
Juliet says, ""Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gimme a heart attack""
He's underneath the window
She's singing, ""Hey la, my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway, what ya gonna do about it?""

""Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet, when you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget
The movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?

Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?

[Verse 2]
Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything
You promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say, ""Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him""

[Chorus 2]
""Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us

When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?

[Verse 3]
""I can't do the talk like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
I can't do anything except be in love with you
And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat and the bad company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time""

Jessie is a friend
Yeah, I know, he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine

And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is probably moot

'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

Wonderin' what she don't see in me

Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

Tell me where can I find a woman like that?
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl

Have words to thank for their positions
Words that scream for your submission

A melanated mother looking at her newborn
A black boy, he see his father in his true form
Strong, vulnerable, grace and poise, and lovable
Ungovernable, ride or die on we thuggin' to
Fondness, tenderness, caring, endearment
Intimacy, spirits you can feel it
Beloved, up above it always covered I can feel it
Thriving always flourishing, somebody tryna to kill it
But we
Stay resilient as the world stay spinning
Stay feeling with that love healing
I feel unity
Mutiny against my oppressors is what be moving me
Love with no power sentimentally
Empower no love, it is tyranny you feeling me?
Warmth and connection to my people most critically
Black love criminalized, seen as a threat
To white supremacy on every corner of the map

My love
It’s on
Your face
They look

Deep in the brown eyes lie dignity and pride
Rebuilding generations, loving the darkest nation
Hair and skin, texture
It's a celebration

Seen everywhere, validated and acknowledged
Picked the black doll in a test paying homage
Many different shades on an earth tone rainbow
Stopped look and listen, see we glisten and our frame glow
Pleasure like a soul food plate when you ain't ate
Collard greens, mac and cheese, red velvet cake
We can celebrate
Set it straight
Libation meditate
Increase and educate
Decrease the murder rate
Sharp like in a [?]
Suited and booted
Civilize and refine
Move as a movement
Gorgeous and beautiful
Uplift and multiply
Platforms generate
Incomes to amplify
How we see ourselves, be ourselves, see our wealth
Dreaming of equity, power, and mental health
Self-determination, respect, and dignity
Need spaces that reflect our identity

Wired to resist the truth

Benefits from terror moves
Beneficiaries of terrorism and argumentive
Country built off this false premise, y'all offended?
Here to crack on my bones and teeth, no relief
Impunity, for police, there is no belief
Segregation, separatism, restricted covenants
Withdraw the funding, redraw the country
Profiling holidays with slaveowners bootstrap pull up

Conflict, dissonance, instability
Uncertainty, lack of control, stifles ability
Humiliate, reduce, destroy
Imagination that produces joy
Inside the minds of black girls and boys

Tokenism, flag waving, white [?]

You gotta turn it on and then you gotta put it out
You gotta be sure that it's something everybody's gonna talk about
Before you decide that the times arrived
For making your mind up

[Refrain]
Don't let your indecision take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind

[Verse 2]
And then you really gotta burn it up and make another fly by night
Get a run for your money and take a chance and it'll turn out right
And when you can see how it's gotta be
You're making your mind up

[Verse 3]
And try to look as if you don't care less but if you want to see some more
Bending the rules of the game will let you find the one you're looking for
And then you can show that you think you know
You're making your mind up

[Refrain]
Don't let your indecision, take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind

[Chorus]
You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up
You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down
'Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up
For making your mind up
For making your mind up
For making your mind up

For your eyes only, can see me through the night
For your eyes only, I never need to hide
You can see so much in me
So much in me that's new
I never felt, until I looked at you

For your eyes only, only for you
You see what no one else can see
Now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The love I know you need in me
The fantasy you freed in me
Only for you, only for you

For your eyes only, the nights are never cold
You really know me, that's all I need to know
Maybe I'm an open book
Because I know you're mine
But you won't need to read between the lines

For your eyes only, only for you
You see what no one else can see
Now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The passions that collide in me
The wild abandoned side of me
Only for you, for your eyes only

You want to fly, don't want your feet on the ground
You stay up, you won't come down

Got fire in your veins
Burning hot but you don't feel the pain
Your desire is insane
You can't stop until you do it again

But sometimes I wonder as I look in your eyes
Maybe you're thinking of some other guy
But I know, yes I know, how to treat you right
That's why you call me in the middle of the night

You say it's urgent
So urgent, so oh oh urgent
Just wait and see
How urgent my love can be

You play tricks on my mind
You're everywhere but you're so hard to find
You're not warm or sentimental
You're so extreme, you can be so temperamental

But I'm not looking for a love that will last
I know what I need and I need it fast
Yeah, there's one thing in common that we both share
That's a need for for each other anytime, anywhere

It gets so urgent
So urgent
You know it's urgent
I want to tell you it's the same for me
So urgent
Just you wait and see
How urgent our love can be

You say it's urgent
Make it fast, make it urgent
Do it quick, do it urgent
Got to rush, make it urgent
Want it quick

Tonight's the night we'll make history
Honey, you and I
And I'll take any risk to tie back the hands of time
And stay with you here tonight
I know you feel these are the worst of times

When people lock their doors and hide inside
Rumor has it, it's the end of paradise
But I know, if the world just passed us by
Baby I know, I wouldn't have to cry, no no
The best of times are when I'm alone with you
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two
Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime
We'll take the best, forget the rest
And someday we'll find
These are the best of times
These are the best of times
The headlines read, ""These are the worst of times""
I do believe it's true
I feel so helpless like a boat against the tide
I wish the summer winds could bring back paradise
But I know, if the world turned upside down
Baby, I know you'd always be around, my my
The best of times are when I'm alone with you
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two
The best of times are when I'm alone with you

You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King

Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people

We know that love can win
Let it out, don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can

I loved a girl named Ruth once but lost her on my way
I saw her shadow walking on a shore leave world today
And now it’s time for going; I leave this world behind
I’ve even lost her shadow, save the one left on my mind

[Verse 2]
I loved dark Miramanee on a world called Paradise
I dreamed away a season there, my years drowned in her eyes
All duty was forgotten, all thought of death denied
I held her in my arms all night and in my arms she died

[Verse 3]
I loved sweet, bright-eyed Edith outside time’s written line
She told me all her secrets and I never told her mine
My world’s survival waited, asked all I could devise
I kept a friend from saving her; she fell before my eyes

[Verse 4]
There was a maid named Rayna once, immortal and unknown
I battled with Methuselah to have her love alone
Her battle was the harder, too fierce, too bittersweet
It tore her untried heart in two; she crumbled at my feet

[Verse 5]
I love them and I lose them and too many times they die
I come home broken-hearted and back to my stars I fly
My steel and star-drive lady, I keep no love but you
And when this mission’s over, I suppose you’ll leave me too
I guess you’ll leave me too

122,Memory,Stages,Elaine Paige,1983,251693,35,"

Day light
See the dew on a sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses wither away
Like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every streetlamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp splutters
And soon
It will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

(Music interlude)

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
A streetlamp dies; another night is over
Another day is dawning...

Touch me!
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun...
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun

She used to be
Everything to me
When she was my girl
When she was my girl

I held her near
Told her how much I cared
When she was my girl
When she was my girl

When she was my girl
There was laughter and loving in my world
Everyday
When she was my girl
Oh what joy she would bring
Now I've lost everything
She's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

I spend the night
Dreaming how she used to be
When she was my girl
When she was my girl

When she was my girl
There was laughter and loving in my world
Yes It Was
Cause she was my girl
Oh what joy she would bring
Now I've lost everything
She's gone,  my big legged girl is gone

She used to be
Everything to me
When she was my girl
When she was my girl

She, she's my girl
She's so foxy can't you see
And this girl belongs to me
She's my girl
When we walk down the street
I would tell everyone we meet
This is my girl

[Verse 1]
Toe to toe, dancing very close
Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

[Verse 2]
Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sightless solitude
And it's finger popping
24-hour shopping in rapture

[Rap 1]
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly
DJ spinnin' I said, ""My My""
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
France Soir c'est pas Flash et Nous Deux
François c'est pas, Flash ain't no dude
And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eatin' bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rap-ture, be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
Said don't stop to punk rock

[Verse 3]
Man to man, body muscular
Seismic decibel, bite the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology
And a digital ladder
No sign of bad luck in rapture

[Rap 2]
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars
Won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars
And eatin' bars and now he only eats guitars, get up

Living on a lighted stage
Approaches the unreal
For those who think and feel
In touch with some reality
Beyond the gilded cage

Cast in this unlikely role
Ill-equipped to act
With insufficient tact
One must put up barriers
To keep oneself intact

Living in the limelight
The universal dream
For those who wish to seem
Those who wish to be
Must put aside the alienation
Get on with the fascination
The real relation
The underlying theme

Living in a fisheye lens
Caught in the camera eye
I have no heart to lie
I can't pretend a stranger
Is a long-awaited friend

All the world's indeed a stage
And we are merely players
Performers and portrayers
Each another's audience
Outside the gilded cage

Got the twelve o'clock news blues
And I've given up hope for the afternoon soaps
And a bottle of cold brew

Is it any wonder I'm sane at all?

[Verse 1]
Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind

Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask, ""Will you be coming back soon?""
You don't know, never know

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye

We walked in the cold air
Freezing breath on a window pane
Lying and waiting
A man in the dark in a picture frame
So mystic and soulful
A voice reaching out in a piercing cry
It stays with you until

The feeling has gone, only you and I
It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna

The music is weaving
Haunting notes, pizzicato strings
The rhythm is calling
Alone in the night as the daylight brings
A cool empty silence
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky
It fades to the distance

It means nothing to me
This means nothing to me

Seven tears are runnin' to the sea
If one day they reach some distant waters

Then you'll know
It's sent with love from me
Here I stand
Head in hand
Lonely like a stranger on the shore
I can't stand this feeling anymore
Day by day
This world's all grey
And if dreams were eagles I would fly

But they ain't
And that's the reason why
Seven tears have flown into the river

Oh
My darling
Oh
My pretty lady

Golden star that leads to paradise
Like a river's running to the ocean
I'll come back to you fourthousand miles
Here I stand
Head in hand
Seven tears have flown into the river

Seven tears have flown into the river

A face on a page, gift from above
She should have known better than to give her heart

She should have not tried to be that way
She shouldn't have to go there ever again

Now listen to us good, and listen well
Listen to the song, everything we tell
We should have known better than to give her away
We should have known better to this very day
Without me
Without me

Listen, Joan of Arc, all you got to do
Say the right words and I'll be coming through
Hold you in my arms and take you right away

Now she's on her away to another land
We never understood why she gave her hand
She shouldn't ought to promise, cause it's just pretend
I know she doesn't mean it and she'll leave again

Morning, afternoon and night
We lay together side by side
Searchin' for lust, searchin' for breath
Searchin' for the touch of life

No words are spoken, the only sound we hear is
Body talk, body talk

The heat of passion is such a beautiful thing
As it overflows, pleasure grows
All the dreams it can bring

Your lips in my eyes and gentle sighs
If body talk, body talk

Cool and kind, so soft and pure, a touching moment
Heated feelings once exploded, but have melted
We were two souls torn apart with bitter ages
Through expression, not aggression, we have become one

Body talk, body talk

Cool and kind, so soft and pure, a touching moment
Heated feelings once explode but have melted
Ooh, we are two souls torn apart with bitter ages
Through expression, not aggression, we have become one

Searchin' for lust, searchin' for breath
Searchin' for the touch of life

No words are spoken, the only sound we hear
Is body talk, body talk

Body talk
Body talk

And still they try to see
Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way street
The taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

One heart burns desire
I wonder, who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
I wonder who's crying now

So many stormy nights
So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change
Their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fighting is worth
The love they save

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
I wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
I wonder who's crying now

Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events

Catch the myth
Catch the mystery
Catch the drift

To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent

Catch the wit
Catch the spirit
Catch the spit

When I see you in the morning
That old sleep still in your eyes
I remember all the laughter
And the tears we shared last night

You're my sunshine, you're my rain

Is loving you

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much

Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

When you're in love, you know you're in love
No matter what you try to do
You might as well resign yourself
To what you're going through
If you're a hard man or if you're a child
It still might get to you
Don't kid yourself, you've seen it all before
A million mouths have said that too, ooh

I've had my hard times (hard times!) in the past
I've been a husband and a lover too
I've laid alone and cried at night
Over what love made me do
And the loved ones who let me down
And couldn't share my point of view
But this is Phil talking, I wanna tell you
What I found to be true

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action

I believe, I believe what the old man says
Though I know that there's no Lord above
I believe in me, I believe in you
And you know I believe in love
I believe in truth, though I lie a lot
I feel the pain from the push and shove
No matter what you put me through
I'll still believe in love, and I say

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking

I am a one in ten, a number on a list
I am a one in ten, even though i don't exist
Nobody knows me, but im always there
A statistic, a reminder of a world that doesn't care

My arms enfold the dole queue
Malnutrition dulls my hair
My eyes are black and lifeless
With an underprivileged stare
I'm the beggar on the corner
Will no-one spare a dime
I'm the child that never learns to read
Because no one spared the time

I am a one in ten a number on a list
I am a one in ten even though i don't exist
Nobody knows me, but im always there
A statistic a reminder of a world that doesn't care

I'm the murderer and the victim
The licence with the gun
I'm a sad and bruised old lady
In an ally in a slum
I'm a middle aged businessman
With chronic heart disease
I'm another teenage suicide
In a street that has no trees

I am a one in ten a number on a list
I am a one in ten even though i don't exist
Nobody knows me, but im always there
A statistic a reminder of a world that doesn't care

I'm a starving third world mother
A refugee without a home
I'm a house wife hooked on Valium
I'm a Pensioner alone
I'm a cancer ridden spectre
Covering the earth
I'm another hungry baby
I'm an accident of birth

I am a one in ten a number on a list
I am a one in ten even though i don't exist
Nobody knows me, but im always there

Lonely is the night when you find yourself alone
Your demons come to light and your mind is not your own
Lonely is the night when there's no one left to call
You feel the time is right, say the writin's on the wall
It's a high time to fight when the walls are closin' in
Call it what you like it's time you got to win
Lonely, lonely, lonely your spirit's sinkin' down
You find you're not the only stranger in this town
Red lights, green lights, stop and go jive
Headlines, deadlines jammin' your mind
You been stealin' shots from the side
Let your feelin's go for a ride
There's danger out tonight, the man is on the prowl
Get the dynamite, the boys are set to howl
Lonely is the night when you hear the voices call
Are you ready for a fight, do you wanna take it all?
Slowdown, showdown waitin' on line
Show time, no time for changin' your mind
Streets are ringin', march to the sound
Let your secrets follow you down
Somebody's watchin' you baby, so much you can do
Nobody's stoppin' you baby, from makin' it too
One glimpse'll show you now baby, what the music can do
One kiss'll show you now baby, it can happen to you
No more sleepin', wastin' our time
Midnight creepin's, first on our minds
No more lazin' 'round the TV
You'll go crazy, come out with me
Feelin' lonely
Lonely is the night
Feelin' lonely

Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

[Intro]
Hi! Hi! We're your weather girls
(Uh huh)
And have we got news for you!
You better listen
Get ready all you lonely girls
And leave those umbrellas at home
Alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Humidity is rising (Mm rising), barometer's getting low (How low, girl?)
According to all sources  (What sources now?)
The street's the place to go (You better hurry up)
'Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men

[Chorus]
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

[Verse 1]
God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel
She rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy

[Chorus]
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!

I feel stormy weather moving in
About to begin
Hear the thun-der
Don't you lose your head!
Rip off the roof and stay in bed

[Verse 2]
God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel
She rearranged the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
Oh, it's raining men! Yeah

[Intro]
Come on Eileen!
Come on Eileen!

[Verse 1]
Poor old Johnnie Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them?
You've grown (You’re grown up!)
So grown (So grown up!)
Now I must say more than ever
(Come on Eileen)
Too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye, ay
And we can sing just like our fathers

Oh, I swear (What he means)
At this moment you mean everything
You in that dress
My thoughts (I confess)
Verge on dirty
Oh, come on Eileen

(Come on Eileen!)

[Verse 2]
These people round here
Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke-dried face
They're so resigned to what their fate is
But not us (No never)
But not us (Not ever)
We are far too young and clever
(Remember)
Too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye, ay
And you'll hum this tune forever, oh

[Chorus]
Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)
Aah, come on let's
Take off everything
That pretty red dress

Were to suddenly leave you, or fly in the night
Just like fairy gifts gone in the sky

Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?

We all know that people are the same wherever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
We learn to live, we learn to give each other what we need to survive
Together alive

Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?

Ebony, ivory, living in perfect harmony

We all know that people are the same wherever you go
There is good and bad, in everyone
We learn to live when we learn to give each other what we need to survive

Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we

Side by side on my piano keyboard

[Verse 1]
So wild, standing there
With her hands in her hair
I can't help remember
Just where she touched me
There's still no face here in her place

So cool, she was like
Jazz on a summer's day
Music, high and sweet
Then she just blew away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now she can't be that warm
With the wind in her arms

[Chorus]
Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be

[Verse 2]
Love songs fill the night
But they don't tell it all
Not how lovers cry out
Just like they're dying

Her cries hang there
In time somewhere

Someday, some good wind
May blow her back to me
Some night I may hear
Her like she used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
No, it can't be that warm
With the wind in her arms

Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me

I could feel at the time
There was no way of knowing
Fallen leaves in the night
Who can say where they're blowing?
As free as the wind
Hopefully learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning

[Chorus]
More than this
You know there's nothing
More than this
Tell me one thing
More than this
Ooh, there's nothing

[Verse 2]
It was fun for a while
There was no way of knowing
Like a dream in the night
Who can say where we're going?
No care in the world
Maybe I'm learning
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning

More than this
You know there's nothing
More than this
Tell me one thing
More than this
No, there's nothing

More than this
Nothing

Now
The mist across the window hides the lines
But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine
Electricity so fine
Look and dry your eyes

[Verse 2: Joe Jackson]
We
So tired of all the darkness in our lives
With no more angry words to say can come alive
Get into a car and drive
To the other side

Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light

[Verse 3: Joe Jackson]
We
Are young but getting old before our time
We'll leave the T.V. and the radio behind
Don't you wonder what we'll find
Steppin' out tonight?

You
Can dress in pink and blue just like a child
And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
We'll be there in just a while
If you follow me

166,Heartbreaker,Heartbreaker,Dionne Warwick,1982,258266,57,"

[Verse 1]
I got to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing, but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around?
And I get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you

[Pre-Chorus]
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
When will we meet again?

[Chorus]
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Got to get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by
This world may end
Not you and I

[Verse 2]
My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you and that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me

[Pre-Chorus]
Out of my mind, I am held by the power of you, love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye?

[Chorus]
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by

Oh, oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
My love for you
Oh, oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by
Tell me, why do you have to be a heartbreaker?

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear wind blow

Some hang on to ""used to be""
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All our life, out there to find

The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb them a step every day

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow

Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive today

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below, up where the clear winds blow

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong

[Verse 1]
Better stop dreaming of the quiet life
'Cos it's the one we'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus
'Cos those rosey days are few
And...stop apologising for the things you've never done
'Cos time is short and life is cruel
But it's up to us to change
This town called Malice

[Verse 2]
Rows and rows of disused milk floats
Stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives
Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing
When tears come fast and furious
In a town called Malice
Ye-eh-eah

Struggle after struggle, year after year
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice
I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah

A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids' new gear
It's a big decision in a town called Malice
Uhuh-yeah

[Verse 4]
The ghost of a steam train echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Just going 'round and 'round, oh
Playground kids and creaking swings
Lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will
But I'd sooner put some joy back
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah (uhuhuh)
In this town called Malice, ye-eh-eah

I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance?
And incidents arose from circumstance
One thing led to another, we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And now you find yourself in Eighty Two
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings

'Cause it's the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself?
Teenage ambitions you remember well

Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snapshot image froze without a sound

Thursday morning was a hot flash-factor

Friday night we'll dance the spotlight grind
Stop-time heart for me if she's not mine

You hook me up, I rendezvous at your place
Your lipstick and your lip gloss seals my fate
Sentimental powers might help you now
But skip the hearts and flowers, skip the ivory towers
You'll be disappointed and I'll lose a friend

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No I won't be told there's a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow
Or that pleasure and pain, sunshine and rain
Might make this love grow

[Chorus 2]
But I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll walk in the room with my heart
Add and subtract but as a matter of fact
Now that you're gone I still want you back
Remembering, surrendering
The kindest cut's the cruelest part
All of my heart

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ohh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus 3]
Yes I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll walk in the room with my heart
And I shrug and I say that maybe today
You'll come home soon
Surrendering, remembering
Surrendering that part
All of my heart

All of my heart

I was walking, down a one way street
Just a looking, for someone to meet
One woman, who was looking for a man
Now I'm hoping (hoping) that the feeling is right
And I'm wondering (wondering) if you'll stay for the night
So I'm coming (I don't want to be lonely baby please tell me)
I want to love you all over

Do you believe in love
Do you believe it's true
Do you believe in love
Oh you're making me believe it too

Now the feeling, is beginning to grow
And the meaning, is something you only know
If you believe it, take my hand and I'll take your heart
Come on
Now I'm wondering (wondering) where does true love begin
I'm going under (under) so I'm letting you in
My woman (I don't want to be lonely baby please tell me)

Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes

The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by
I'm looking through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

Well, we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem, they're killing time
Filling out forms, standing in line

[Verse 2]
Well, our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers at the USO
Asked them to dance, danced with them slow

[Chorus]
And we're living here in Allentown
But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay

[Verse 3]
Well, we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard, if we behaved

[Verse 4]
So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke, chromium steel

[Chorus]
And we're waiting here in Allentown
But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away

[Bridge]
Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened
On the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our face

Well I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be getting up today

Well you know that it does
And lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice

Faces freedom with a little fear
I have no fear, I have only love
And if I was a child

Enough for me to love

The water shines
A pebble skips across the face
A dozen times
Then disappears, not a trace
Left behind
The thrower turns and walks away
A change of mind
Another start, a brand new day

You know I'll change
If change is what you require
Your every wish
Your every dream, hope, desire

Here comes the mirror man
Says he's a people fan
Here comes the mirror man

And if it seems
I'm not the one you used to know
Our little friendship
Left behind not long ago
Don't feel too hurt
As distance heals the strongest pain
Things are much better now
And just the nagging doubt remains

You know I'll change
If change is what you require
Your every wish
Your every dream, hope, desire

Here comes the mirror man
Says he's a people fan

There's a guy starting to realize
That his eternal fate has turned its back on him
It's two A.M

It's two A.M., the fear has gone
I'm sitting here waitin', the gun still warm
Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances

Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Double crossed messenger all alone
Can't get no connection, can't get through
Where are you?

Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hitman comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated

Hey, lady, you, lady
Cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother
And a regimented wife
I've no doubt you dream about
The things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me
Like I wanna talk of you

[Verse 2]
Ooo, I've been to Georgia
And California
And anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free

I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Please lady, please, lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part
Of a weary heart
That has lived a million lives

[Verse 4]
Oh, I've been to Nice
And the isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
And showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things
That a woman ain't supposed to see

[Chorus]
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

[Spoken Verse 5]
Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
A fantasy we created about people and places
As we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love

[Verse 6]
Sometimes I've been to crying
For unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life I never knew
I'd be bitter from the sweet
I've spent my life exploring
The subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free

Hey lady, I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me
I've been to paradise
Never been to me

I've been to Georgia and California

190,Don't Talk to Strangers,Success Hasn't Spoiled Me,Rick Springfield,1982-03-23,180360,53,"

When you were just a young girl and still in school
How come you never learned the golden rule?
Don't talk to strange men, don't be a fool
I'm hearing stories; I don't think that's cool

Why dont'cha tell me someone isn't lovin' you?
'Cause you're my girl, some say it's no longer true
You're seeing some slick continental dude
I'm beggin' you, please

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you

Now tell me, how's life in the big city?
I hear the competition's tough; baby, that's a pity
And every man's an actor; every girl is pretty
I don't like what's gettin' back to me

Now, who's this Don Juan I've been hearing of?
Love hurts when only one's in love
Now, did ya fall at first sight or did you need a shove?
I'm beggin' you, please

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you

(Fais l'amour avec moi)
What's he sayin', baby?
(Viens dormir, mon amour)
I asked you not to talk to him
(Je t'aime donne moi ton cœur se soir)
I'm begging you

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha
(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers...)

Even lovers need a holiday
Far away, from each other

It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay

And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

If I were to say to you, ""can you keep a secret?""
Would you know just what to do or where to keep it?
Then I say, ""I love you"", foul the situation
Hey girl, I thought we were the right combination

Bow to the target, blame Cupid, Cupid

No rhythm in cymbals, no tempo in drums

But raise your aim, raise your aim

You grow cold when you keep holding on
You know you've changed
And your words they lie

If you wanna leave
Then why don't you say
Your love has gone anyway

Won't be long before you're gone
There's something going on

Must come to an end
But it's hard to take
Losing a friend
I know what you think
And what's in your mind
So darling, why pretend?

So much you can't hide
Put on a little makeup, makeup
Make sure they get your good side, good side
If the word's unspoken
Gets stuck in your throat
Send a treasure token, token

Goody two, goody two, goody goody two shoes
Don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?
You don't drink, don't smoke, what do you do?

There must be something inside

We don't follow fashion
That'd be a joke
You know we're going to set them, set them
So everyone can take note, take note
When they saw you kneeling
Crying words that you mean
Opening their eyeballs, eyeballs
Pretending that you're Al Green, Al Green

What's wrong and what's right
Or tell me who to eat with, sleep with
Or that I've won the big fight, big fight

Look out or they'll tell you
You're a ""Superstar""
Two weeks and you're an all-time legend
I think the games have gone much too far

Look right through me, look right through me

[Chorus]
And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
'Cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad world
Mad world
Halargian world
Mad world

[Refrain]
Hey sucker
(What the hell's got into you?)
Hey sucker
(Now there's nothing you can do)

[Verse 1]
Well I hadn't seen your face around town awhile
So I greeted you, with a knowing smile
When I saw that girl upon your arm
I knew she won your heart with a fatal charm
I said ""Soul boy, let's hit the town""
I said ""Hey boy, what's with the frown?""
But in return, all you could say was
""Hi George, meet my fiancee""

[Chorus]
Young guns having some fun
Crazy ladies keep 'em on the run
Wise guys realize there's danger in emotional ties
See me, single and free
No tears, no fears, what I want to be
One, two, take a look at you
Death by matrimony

A married man, you're out of your head
Sleepless nights, on an H.P. bed
A daddy by the time you're twenty-one
If your happy with a nappy then you're in for fun
But you're here and you're there
Well there's guys like you just everywhere
Looking back on the good old days?
Well this young gun says caution pays

Young guns having some fun

No tears, no fears, what I want to be

I remember when he such fun and everything was fine
I remember when we use to have a good time, partners in crime
Tell me that's all in the past and I will gladly walk away
Tell me that you're happy now, turning my back nothing to say

""Hey tell this jerk to take a hike
There's somethin' 'bout that boy I don't like""
""Well sugar he don't mean the things he said""
""Just get him outta my way, 'cause I'm seeing red
We got plans to make, we got things to buy
And you're wasting time on some creepy guy""
""Hey shut up chick, that's a friend of mine
Just watch your mouth babe, you're out of line""

Get back! Hands off! Go for it!
Get back! Hands off!
Get back! Hands off! Go for it!

[Verse 1]
Are you the kind to put your heart on the line?
Or one who stays out of reach?
Cause unlike other guys I won't waste your time
I just wanna practice what I preach
Girl, love can be such a challenge
A game where there can be two winners
Unlike any sport
It depends on the prize
And knowing where the real thing lies
To make a long story short

[Chorus]
Baby, I can make you feel good (I can make you feel good)
Let me lay this good love on ya
Baby, I can make you feel good (I can make you feel good)
You can say I really want you
(Oh, it's so good)

[Verse 2]
There's guys that offer you diamonds and pearls
Those are the ones without the need
Other guys say that they can give you the world
But a world of love is what you'll get from me
Girl, those material things
Meant more to me before the day I found you
Now I truly believe
All the money in the world
Can't comfort you the way I wrap my arms around you
And I'll always be there

[Chorus]
Baby, I can make you feel good (I can make you feel good)
Let me lay this good love on you (Whoa whoa)

It used to be so easy to be your lover
We wandered through the days like they had no end
But now that you are gone I'm under cover
I just can't think about you as a friend

Take it easy on me
It should be easy to see
I'm getting lost in a crowd
Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do
Take it easy on me

So now I'll go the minstrel road without
I know there will be times when I need you there
And each night as I sing those songs about you
I'll think back to the time when you used to care

Take it easy on me

I'm getting lost in a crowd
Hear me crying out loud
Just want you to know
I know that you have to go
It's all up to you but whatever you do

Just one more chance with you
One more chance will you, take chance?
Come on and take a chance

Take it easy on me

I, I was the lonely one
Wondering what went wrong
Why love had gone
And left me lonely
I, I was so confused
Feeling like I'd just been used
Then you came to me
And my loneliness left me

I used to think I was tied to a heartache
That was the heartbreak
But now that I've found you
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better
Since I found you

You, you knew just what to do
'Cause you had been lonely too
And you showed me how
To ease the pain and
You did more than mend a broken heart
'Cause now you've made a fire start
And I, I can see
That you feel the same way

I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me
Until you told me and now that I've found you
Even the nights are better
Now that we're here together
Even the nights are better
Since I found you, oh
Even the days are brighter
When someone you love's beside you
Even the nights are better

Succumb to the beat surrender

All the things that I'm not sure about
(Are sorted out at once)

And as it was in the beginning
So shall it be in the end
That bullshit is bullshit
It just goes by different names

Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender

All the things that I shout about
(But never act upon)
All the courage and the dreams I have

Watch phonies run to hide
The dignified don't even enter in the game

Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender

And if you feel there's no passion
No quality sensation
Seize the young determination
Show the fakers you ain't foolin'

You'll see me come runnin'
To the sound of your strummin'
Fill my heart with joy and gladness
I've lived too long in the shadows of sadness

My doubt is cast aside
Watch phonies run to hide
The dignified don't even enter in the game

Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender
Come on boy, come on girl
Succumb to the beat surrender

Wake me up with your amphetamine blast
Take me by the collar, throw me out into the world
Rock me gently and send me dreaming of something tender
I was brought here to pay homage
To the Beat Surrender

With another disguise
'Cause there's no compromise when the negative is dry

(It doesn't matter what I do) For you
('Cause every time you take me I'm sleeping) You're never gonna shake me now
(It doesn't matter how I try) For you
(I can see by the look in your eyes)

(The camera never lies)
My camera never lies
So I'll put you in the picture and cut it down to size (My camera, oh, oh)

My camera never lies anymore
'Cause there's nothing worth lying for (My camera never lies)
There's nothing worth lying for (My camera never lies)
My camera never lies anymore

(Ah click click, ah click click)
My camera, my camera, my camera never lies
Lies oho, oho

My camera never lies anymore
'Cause there's nothing worth lying for

My camera never lies
So I put you in the picture and cut it down to size (My camera, oh, oh)

My camera never lies anymore
'Cause there's nothing worth lying, nothing worth lying
Nothing worth lying for

My camera never lies anymore (My camera never lies)
My camera never lies anymore (My camera never lies)
My camera never lies anymore (My camera never lies)
My camera never lies anymore (My camera never lies)

[Intro]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Ooh baby, now let's get down tonight

[Verse 1]
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

[Chorus]
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual healing baby, is good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me

[Verse 2]
Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and
Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing

(Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up)
'Cause you do it right

[Bridge]
Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

[Chorus]
And when I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
Sexual healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby
Ohhh

[Verse 3]
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate

(Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up)
'Cause you do it right

(Heal me my darling)
I can't wait for you to operate

[Chorus]
When I get this feeling
I need sexual healing
Oh when I get this feeling
I need sexual healing
I gotta have sexual healing, darling
'Cause I'm all alone
Sexual healing, darling
'Till you come back home

Please don't procrastinate
It's not good to masturbate

221,The Bitterest Pill (I Ever Had To Swallow),The Gift (Deluxe Edition),The Jam,1982-03-12,213320,44,"

In your white lace and your wedding bells
You look the picture of contented new wealth
But from the on-looking fool who believed your lies
I wish this grave would open up and swallow me alive
For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad coloured, mocking shadows

When the wheel of fortune broke, you fell to me
Out of grey skies to change my misery
The vacant spot, your beating heart took its place
Now watch smoke leave my lips and fill an empty room

For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad coloured, mocking shadows

The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more ill

The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more ill

Now autumn's breeze blows summer's leaves through my life
Twisted and broken dawn, no days with sunlight
The dying spark, you left your mark on me
The promise of your kiss, but with someone else

For the bitterest pill is mine to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-coloured, mocking shadows

The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill!
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore pain!
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill!
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took it for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore pain!

Those were the times we had
Sharing a joy that we thought would last

Did we give up too soon?
Maybe we needed just a little room
Wondering how it all happened
Maybe we just need a little time
Though we did end as friends
Given the chance we could love again
She'll always love you forever

I want you and I need you so I'm

Lays me down, with my mind she runs

From far away, stays for a day
Never a frown with golden brown

There it is, there it is
What took us so long to find each other, baby?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong
But I knew the answer to why people fall in love
But then I found I knew nothing about it
Till I met you, girl, I thought that I had had enough
Now I'm sure I've always been without it
And it feels so good that you and I can go together
Ooh baby, we won't find what we've been looking for
And this time I know we're gonna make it better
Our heart is a key to pump it at the door
Don't have to search no more
There it is, there it is
What took us so long, ooh, to find each other, baby?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong
In the sea of love we set our sails when waters were up
Two in search of love with no direction
Fish were biting at the time when catching wasn't enough
We couldn't make a sport of our affection
And who could change that we would sail into each other
Ooh girl, I never felt the wave of love so strong
And this love I never felt in any other
I trust it like the lighthouse guides the ship to land
I found it when you touched my hand
There it is
What took us so long for a love so strong?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong
And it's about time
For love to find its way back home
Girl, you're mine
Now that we've found love we've got to get it on
There it is, baby
There it is, this time I'm not wrong
Got a love that's so strong
Like the light, how this guides the ship to land
I found it when you touched my hand
There it is, there it is
What took us so long to find each other, baby?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong
There it is, hey, what took us so long
To find the sweet, sweet love?
There it is
This time I'm not wrong
This time I'm not wrong
We got a love that's so strong

Stars in your eyes, little one
Where do you go to dream
To a place, we all know
The land of make believe

Shadows tapping at your window
Ghostly voices whisper: ""Will you come and play?""

Not for all the tea in China
Or the corn in Carolina
Never, never ever
They're running after you, babe

Run for the sun little one
You're an outlaw once again
Time to change, Superman
He'll be with us while he can
In the land of make believe

Something nasty in your garden's waiting
Patiently, 'till it can have your heart

Try to go but it won't let you
Don't you know it's out to get you running
Keep on running
They're running after you, babe

Run for the sun, little one
You're an outlaw once again
Time to change, Superman
He'll be with us while he can
In the land of make believe

Your world is turning
From night to day
Your dream is burning far, far away

Into the blue, you and I
To the circus in the sky
Captain Kids on the sand
With the treasure close at hand
In the land of make believe

In the land of make believe

Run for the sun, little one
You're an outlaw once again
Time to change, Superman
He'll be with us while he can
In the land of make believe

Run for the sun, little one
You're an outlaw once again
Time to change, Superman
He'll be with us while he can
In the land of make believe

And no-one else can see but me
He came today but had to go
To visit you?
Ya never know)

Who will dance on the floor in the round

Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, huhn huh
Making love with each other, huhn hah

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, huhn hah
From one lover to another, huhn hah

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, huhn hah
Making love with each other, huhn hah

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, huhn hah
From one lover to another, huhn hah

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, huhn hah
From one lover to another, huhn hah

That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me

Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances, win or loser
See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you, and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Say - you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You, lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Will decide the lonely heart

Don't deceive your free will at all
Owner of a lonely heart
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it

You've been around
For such a long time now
Oh, maybe I could leave you
But I don't know how

And why should I be lonely every night
When I can be with you
Oh, yes
You make it right

That you're bad for me
And I should turn you away
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love

Wherever you go now
I wanna be there too

They say we're crazy
But I just don't care
And if they keep on talking
Still they get nowhere

So I don't mind if they don't understand
When I look at you when you hold my hand
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love

Why should it matter to us
If they don't approve
We should just take our chances
While we've got nothing to lose

There's no need for living in the past
Now I've found good loving
Gonna make it last

I tell the others
Don't bother me
Cause when they look at you
They don't see what I see

No, I don't listen to their wasted lines
Got my eyes wide open
And I see the signs
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love

The last that ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow

Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through

I stay, I pray
See you in Heaven, far away
I stay, I pray
See you in Heaven one day

Four A.M. in the morning

When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one
Good way to reassure

[Chorus 2]
Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe

[Bridge 2]
Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?

[Verse 4]
Listen boy it's good information
From a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you
What you should do

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

[Outro]
Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it
Tell her now that you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You've got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell, tell, tell her about it
Now, tell her about it

I know
I know what's on your mind
And I know it gets tough sometimes
But you can give it one more try

Find a reason why
You should pick it up
Oooh, and try it again

Cause it's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out
Cause it's not too late for that
Too late for me

I know I've been hurt before
And I know I really shouldn't give any more
But this time
This time things seem just a little different

And when I look in your eyes
You know I can see that it's true
And I hear you say

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it

Cause it's not too late for that
Too late for love

Just when you feel helpless
Nothing left to say
Love will find us, the past behind us
Then we're on our way

Time and time again I see
People so unsure like me
We all know it gets hard sometimes

You can give it one more try
Find another reason why
You should pick it up
Oooh, you should kick it up
Oooh, and try it again

Cause it's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love, can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
We're moving farther away, want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you

Sometimes when I think of your name
When it's only a game and I need you
Listening to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay when I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine, can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand behind the closed door

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew, only you

Loving Couple:
I can't see you but I know you're there
Got to get beside you cos it's really cold out here
Come up close to me you'll soon be warm
Hold me tightly like we're sheltering from a storm

Mouse:
Think I might go out for a stroll
Into the night, and out of this hole
Maybe find me a meal
Walking along this new shag pile
Presents a problem all the while
Nearly the door

Suddenly he bumps into wood, the door is closed
A voice from the bed, he'll be exposed
Which way to run, must make for the hole
The light's been turned on, he's blind as a mole in coal

Now I can see they're coming at me
They've blocked off my door, I haven't a chance in hell

Couple:
Come on baby let the poor thing go
I'm not sleeping with that thing around here, no
Alright then, I'll fetch a box from below
Guard him carefully, they're very quick you know

Mouse:
The door's been opened, my chance to escape
Must run out quick, better sorry than late
I'm out on the stairs
They won't catch me now, I've the run of the house now
I'll make it downstairs and into the breadbin
That would be nice

Suddenly he bumps into fur, that's very unwise
A cat is much quicker than men and their eyes
The chase that ensues can have only one end
Unless outside help steps in for our friend in need

But now the cat comes in for the kill
His paw is raised, soon blood will spill, yes it will

Cat:
Hard luck mouse, this is the end of your road
The signpost says inside me, let me bear your heavy load

But it's not to be, that final pounce
Knocks a jar upon his head, and lays him out

But it's all in a mouse's night
To take on all those who would fight

Cat's Story:
There I was with my back to the wall
Then comes this monster mouse, he's ten feet tall
With teeth and claws to match
It only took one blow

Some people stay far away from the door
If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by

Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie

I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you

But I'm not above making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can

Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young
I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man

[Chorus]
I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am

Some people say they will never believe
Another promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before

Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that it's easier to hate
Then to wait anymore

I know you don't want to hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there

And if I can survive I can keep you alive
I'm not above going through it again
I'm not above being cool for a while
If you're cruel to me, I'll understand

Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man

I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am
An innocent man

You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
That's your decision

But I'm not below anybody I know
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
I'm not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began

Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
But I'm not willing to lay down and die
Because I am an innocent man

I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am

[Verse 1]
We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine

[Verse 2]
I say, we can go where we want to
A place where they'll never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind
We can dance (Danser!)

[Verse 3]
We can go where we want to
The night is young and so am I
And we can dress real neat
From our hats to our feet
And surprise 'em with a victory cry

[Verse 4]
I say, we can act if we want to
If we don't nobody will
And you can act real rude
And totally removed
And I can act like an imbecile

[Chorus]
I say, we can dance, we can dance
Everything is out of control
We can dance, we can dance
We're doing it from pole to pole
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody look at your hands
We can dance, we can dance
Everybody's taking the chance

Safe to dance
Well it's safe to dance
Yes, it's safe to dance

[Verse 5]
We can dance if we want to
We've got all your life and mine
As long as we abuse it
Never gonna lose it
Everything will work out right

[Verse 1]
I say, We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Well they're no friends of mine

Everything is out of control
We can dance, we can dance
We're doing it from pole to pole

[Verse 1:]
Since you've been gone
I shut my eyes
And I fantasize that you're here with me

Will you ever return?
I won't be satisfied
'Til you're by my side
Don't wait any longer
(Come back)

[Chorus:]
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry

Come back
And stay for good this time
(Did you write the book of love?)
Come back
And stay for good this time
(Ego, envy, lust)

[Verse 2:]
When you said goodbye
I was trying to hide
What I felt inside
Until you passed me by

You said you'd return
You said that you'd be mine
'Til the end of time
But don't wait any longer
(Why don't you come back)

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Since you've been gone
I opened my eyes
And I realize
What we had together

Will you ever return?
Or have you changed your mind
If you won't stay mine
Just love me forever
(Love me forever)

[Chorus:]
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry
Why don't you come back?
Please hurry

Why don't you come back?

Why don't you come back?

And stay for good this time

[Verse 1]
We started dancing
And love put us into a groove
As soon as we started to move
The music played
While our bodies
Displayed through the dance
Then love picked us out for romance

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought it was clear
The plan was we would share
This feeling just between ourselves
But when the music changed
The plan was rearranged
He went to dance with someone else

We started dancing
And love put us into a groove
But now he's with somebody new
What does love want me to do?
Love said

[Chorus]
Let the music play
He won't get away
Just keep the groove
And then he'll come back to you again
(Let it play)

Let the music play
He won't get away
This groove he can't ignore
He won't leave you anymore
(No, no, no)

[Verse 2]
He tried pretending
A dance is just a dance
But I see
He's dancing his way back to me
Guess he's discovered

We are truly lovers
Magic from the very start
'Cause love just kept me groovin'
And he felt me movin'
Even though we danced apart

[Pre-Chorus]
So we started dancing
And love put us into the groove
As soon as we started to move
As soon as we started to move
Love said

[Chorus]
Let the music play
He won't get away
Just keep the groove
And then he'll come back to you again
(Let it play)

Let the music play
He won't get away
This groove he can't ignore
He won't leave you anymore
(No, no, no)

[Outro]
He tried pretending
A dance is just a dance
But I see
He's dancing his way back to me
He's dancing his way back to me
Love said

Let the music play
(He won't get away)
Just keep the groove
And then he'll come back to you again
(Let it play)
Let the music play
He won't get away...

I think I finally know you

I think that I can show you
That what we have is still worthwhile

Don't you know that love's just like the thread
That keeps unravelling
But then it ties us back together in the end

In your eyes
I can see my dream's reflections
In your eyes
From the answers to my questions
In your eyes
I can see the reasons why our love's alive
In your eyes
We're drifting safely back to shore
I think I've finally learned to love you more

She warned me that life changes
And that no one really knows
Whether time would make us strangers
Or whether time would make us grow

Even though the winds of time will change
In a world where nothing stays the same
Through it all
Our love will still remain

In your eyes
I can see my dream's reflections

In your eyes
I can see the reasons why our loves alive
You and I
We're drifting safely back to shore
I think I've finally learned to love you more

I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be all right
Perhaps it's just imagination

And day after day it reappears
And night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

Alone between the sheets
Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear

Maybe that's because you securely locked me up
Then threw away the key

Oh mama
Please would you find the key
Oh pretty mama
Please won't you let me go free

How could I be so blind?

That I thought led to the straight
You set me on a firmly laid and simple course

How come I love them more ?

Was to walk out the door

Young at heart
You're so young at heart

You're so young at heart
Young at heart
You're so young at heart

[Verse 1]
The heart of the city street was beating
Light from the neons turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out before the magic got away

[Chorus]
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
We were running, running with the night

[Verse 2]
You were looking so good girl, heads were turning
You and me on the town ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us, we were burning
We were going to go all the way and we never had a doubt

[Chorus]
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
We were running, running with the night

[Bridge]
We were so in love you and me
On the boulevard wild and free
Giving all we got, we laid it down
Taking every shot, we took the town

[Chorus]
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
We were running, running with the night
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
We were running, running with the night

[Outro]
Just you and I, girl it was so right (We were running)
Girl so right (running with the night)
So right

277,Shame On The Moon,The Distance,Bob Seger,1982-12-01,295053,54,"

[Verse 1]
Until you've been beside a man
You don't know what he wants
You don't know if he cries at night
You don't know if he don't
Where nothing comes easy
Old nightmares are real
Until you've been beside a man
You don't know how he feels

[Verse 2]
Once inside a woman's heart
A man must keep his head
Heaven opens up the door
Where angels fear to tread
Some men go crazy
Some men go slow
Some men go just where they want
Some men never go

[Chorus]
Ooh, blame it on midnight
Whoa, shame on the moon

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Everywhere is all around
Comfort in the crowd
Stranger's faces all round
Laughing right out loud
Hey, watch where you're goin'
Step light on old toes
Until you've been beside a man
You don't know who he knows

[Chorus]
Ooh, blame it on midnight
Whoa, shame on the moon
Ooh, blame it on midnight
Whoa, shame on the moon
Whoa-hoo-hoo
Blame it on midnight
You can blame it on midnight
Shame, shame, shame
Shame on the moon
Blame it on midnight
Shame on the moon

I play out my role
Why I've even been out walking
They tell me that it helps
But I know when I'm beaten
All those lonely films
And all those lonely parties
But now the feeling is off-screen
An' the tears for real not acted, anymore

I'm all mixed up inside
I want to run but I can't hide
And however much we try
We can't escape the truth and the fact is

Don't matter what I do
It don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
'Cause I end up hurting you

One more covered sigh
And one more glance you know means goodbye
Can't you see that's why
We're dashing ourselves against the rocks of a lifetime

(In my mind different voices call)
What once was pleasure now's pain for us all
(In my heart only shadows fall)
I once stood proud now I feel so small
(I don't know whether to laugh or cry)
The long hot summer just passed me by

Don't put your head on my shoulder
Sink me in a river of tears
This could be the best place yet
But you must overcome your fears

Ooh in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show

Because time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
They've got nothing but time
And time won't give me time
Won't give me time
(Time, Time, Time...)

Don't make me feel any colder
Time is like a clock in my heart
Touch we touch was the heat too much
I felt I lost you from the start

Ooh, in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show

Because time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel
Like they've got something real
But you and me we know
They've got nothing but time
And time won't give me time
Won't give me time

[Verse 1]
If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
Time can erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared
Now you're gone, I'm really not the same
I guess I held myself to blame
Time can erase the things we said
But it gives me time to realize that you're the one who's sad

You know I won't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found
You know I can't hold you back now

Now that I'm alone it gives me time
To think about the years that you were mine
Time can erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared

You know I won't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found - Listen to me, baby

We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk, the way we talk
The way we stalk, the way we kiss

We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker, and wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and throw all the songs we know

[Chorus]
Into the sea, you and me
All the years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We're so wonderfully, wonderfully
Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea, huh?
We should have each other with cream?

Then curl up in the fire
And sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dream

Into the sea, you and me
All the years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing

Then curl up in the fire
Get up for awhile

Hand in hand is the only way to land
And always the right way round
Not broken in pieces, like hated little meeces
How could we miss someone as dumb as this?

Oh, solid gold
How could we miss
Someone as dumb as this?

You're begging me to go
Then making me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?

But I'm trapped by your love
And I'm chained to your side

Will you turn me away
Or touch me deep inside?

Will it still feel the same?

Though I live in the edge time is on my side
All the doors to my life are open wide
Just as long as the wheels keep on turning round
I will live for the groove 'til the sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... is it a crazy notion?
Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion

I don't wanna go to war, I don't wanna go to war
I said I know what I want an' I don't wanna go to war
Do you follow me?
I saw a soldier standing in a bar, looked so tired, he'd come so far
He said ""I need to love someone before they drop the atom bomb""

There's a girl at the back making eyes at me
And her hair long and black is a sight to see
But I get kind of scared when love's around
I just live for the groove 'til the sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... is it a false emotion?
Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion

So I'm-a-taking you out but I'm-a-faking
I'm married to the beat
To the music I gave the heart I could have given you-hoo
Still there's something 'bout the way that you move
And the way the people stare, it's the shock of the new
I want my friends to see me standing next to you

The sun goes down

Time is on my side
I don't care what they say, I'll enjoy the ride
But I get kind of scared when I turn around
So I'll stay with the groove 'til the sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion

Ooh watch her dance
There must be one like her in every club in every town
But I don't mind if that's the way she wants to be
There something 'bout her that reminds me of me
She's my soulmate - we'll be together 'til the sun goes down

The sun goes down

Living it up ... living it up ... I can feel it
Living it up ... I got forward motion

I love you whether or not you love me
I love you even if you think that I don't
Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you
But I don't mind
Why should I mind
Why should I mind

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear
Never worry never be sad
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can
This is why I don't mind you doubting

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be
The door always must be left unlocked
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you
And not to spend the time just doubting

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

What is love anyway

I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find ya

Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?

The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past

Ticket to ride, white line highway
Tell all your friends, they can go my way
Pay your toll, sell your soul
Pound-for-pound costs more than gold

Either up your nose or through your vein
With nothing to gain except killing your brain

Higher, baby

A multi-million dollars almost overnight
Twice as sweet as sugar
Twice as bitter as salt

And don't ever come down! (Freebase!)

(Turns you on) you really turn me on and on
(Cause you gotta come down) my temperature is risin'
(When the thrill is gone) no, I don't want you to go

A street kid gets arrested, gonna do some time
He got out three years from now just to commit more crime
A businessman is caught with 24 kilos
He's out on bail and out of jail
And that's the way it goes, raah!

Athletes rejected, governerds corrected
Gangsters, thugs and smugglers are thoroughly respected
The money gets divided
The women get excited
Now I'm broke and it's no joke
It's hard as hell to fight it, don't buy it!

Little Jack Horner sitting on the corner
With no shoes and clothes
This ain't funny, but he took his money
And sniffed it up his nose

Why she still care, still here after I blamed her
For all my problems
Had the nerve to say I forgave her
For not being who I thought I wanted
Haunted by my fantasies
Reality I’m tender-hearted, slipping out of sanity
You ever feel broken at the end of your rope
Feel betrayed by the different ways you used to cope
My strengths turned to weakness, my demons are my secrets
I don’t want to tell, fuck I look like needing help
My shoulder’s bad, the burden, that’s a blessing turned cursed
Took a stillborn to see my own rebirth
I wouldn’t know that til later now I’m mention the [?]
Gripped a fifth and (ayoo, yo, are you good bro?)

You might want to check on your strong friend
Seeing if they strong in the long end
Might see if they struggling
If they need love and a helping hand

[Verse 2]
I’m on the bridge, on the ledge with the gun holding
With them pills, slit the wrist, with the noose folding
Got the smiles got the jokes but inside crying
Staying high, staying big, yet inside dying
Isolated in a crowd of people
Voices in my head speaking pure evil
If I start to speak they talking medication
I need a vacation, twist up with meditation
What’s wrong with me?
Thought I was stronger now I’m feeling weak
Ain’t really here, can’t really eat
Never used words like depressed or stressed
It was either you was living or you facing death
Answer my ghost and heal the hurt lurking
Central nervous system tapped and it ain’t working
Resilience in the face of odds
The complexity of sorrow got me praising God
My weaponized skin tone got me unarmed
My unanswered prayers kept me unharmed
Through a circle, never landed on an angle
Tried to jump, I got caught up in a tangle

[?] you took my people, oh
Used my skin, my skin
To try [?]
In another sequel

[Chorus]
You might want to check on your strong friend
Seeing if they strong in the long end
Might see if they struggling
If they need love and a helping hand

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz
Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits
Puttin' on the ritz

Dressed up like a million-dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (Super duper)
Come, let's mix where Rockefellers
Walk with sticks or umbrellas in their mitts
Puttin' on the ritz

Have you seen the well-to-do
Up and down Park Avenue?
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air
High hats and Arrow collars
White spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime for a wonderful time

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz
Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits
Puttin' on the ritz

Dressed up like a million-dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (Super duper)
Come, let's mix where Rockefellers
Walk with sticks or umbrellas in their mitts

Dressed up like a million-dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (Super duper)
If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?

Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz

Downtown, uptown
Get your kicks at the Ritz
Dine and wine, but not 'til nine
The time is right for us tonight
We can move
Move to the rhythm
We can
Move

Dance to the rhythm, nice and easy
I want you to move
Put it on, puttin' it on, puttin' it on, puttin' it on
The R-I-T-Z, how about you and me, says

Gotta dance
Gotta dance

If you're blue and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?

[Verse 1]
How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And still, I find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But, if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting

[Verse 3]
I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?
(Grows cold, grows cold, grows cold, grows cold)

I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie

I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream

And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose

And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try

And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game

But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are all
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight

The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright

I've gotta follow it cause everything I know
Well it's nothing till I give it to you

I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock

I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone

But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

(Making love) Out of nothing at all
(Making love) Out of nothing at all
(Making love) Out of nothing at all
(Making love) Out of nothing at all

When I first saw you
Something stirred within me
You were standing sultry in the rain
If I could've held you
I would've held you
Rip it up and start again

Rip it up and start again
Rip it up and start again
I hope to God you're not as dumb as you make out
I hope to God
I hope to God
And I hope to God I'm not as numb as you make out
I hope to God

And when I next saw you
My heart reached out for you
My arms stuck like glue to my sides
If I could've held you
I would've held you
But I'd choke rather than swallow my pride

And there were times I'd take my pen
And feel obliged to start again
I do profess
That there are things in life
That one can't quite express
You know me, I'm acting dumb-dumb
You know this scene is very humdrum
And my favorite song's entitled ""Boredom""

Rip it up and start again
I said rip it up and start again
I said rip it up and rip it up and rip it up and rip it up
Rip it up and start again

Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract

But whatever the reason you do it for me

Hearts turn cold still goes clink
Put glitter on shit, it’s still gon’ stink

Hundred thou- in debt, tryna forget
Growing on a quarter like I’m in a quartet

Trimming with a tee, got a response of three
Fighter, flighter, freeze
Ignite, dynamite a leaves, slip slaughter up in debris
With the mind short-circuit and nerves just seize
These are the wounds that don’t heal
Remember like a dream even they’re so real
When they’re fighting and polite and there’s no one left to out run
Five-O say freeze and you got numb

If I kill kill, can I get my soul back
Life’s cheap now, big slash road back
Didn’t always cost [?] did you know that?
Wonder why we left homie can I go back?

Why do Irish people drink a lot?
As I walk into the liquor spot
Heard I’m German didn't know my pops
All my homies got my lesson
Didn’t know ‘bout that [?] regular in my city
Like it’s our fault our cultures at the Wal-Mart
Across seas, it was there it got tore apart
You pour a piss on our leg like it’s [?]
Traumatized from the shit our grandfathers saw
Like a lot of y’all
I’m protective and vulnerable
I know every move you could ever do
It’s passed down to me, I pass it down to you
Why they call you white when you colorful
We got colonized
My ancestor’s thoughts was not mine
I know this land’s not mine
Fuck them tax books they sold to you
I don’t want to take your soul from you

If I kill kill, can I get my soul back
Life’s cheap now, big slash road back
Didn’t always cost [?] did you know that?

White supremacy is the context
It’s a nuanced problem, shit’s complex
In the suburbs, in the section 8 complex

You don’t wanna die then you better bow down
Yeah I know about it, yeah I been around town
We ain’t fuckin’ with the government when it go down

Grandpa where were you when they were burning churches?
Grandma what about the babies in the service?
Father, why you so solemn in your sermons?
Are you all too nervous to consider what the curse is?
Grandad cut his wrists in the bathtub
Papa hit the bottle til his car crashed up
Not even the mirror is a safe place, tryna save face while I’m tearing this mask up

Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin' out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

[Chorus]
Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh)
Sad songs say so much

If someone else is sufferin' enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

So turn 'em on, turn 'em on

And you might know how to play with fire
But did you know of the murder committed
In the name of love - yeah
You thought what a pity

To find your dreams have washed away

There is a dream and it's held by many
Well I'm sure you had to see
It's open arms

Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose

Needed a friend
And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you 'til the end

[Songtext zu „99 Luftballons“]

[Strophe 1]
Hast du etwas Zeit für mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von 99 Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Denkst du vielleicht grad an mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von 99 Luftballons
Und, dass sowas von sowas kommt

[Strophe 2]
99 Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man für Ufos aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General
'Ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so wär
Dabei war'n dort am Horizont
Nur 99 Luftballons

[Strophe 3]
99 Düsenflieger
Jeder war ein großer Krieger
Hielten sich für Captain Kirk
Es gab ein großes Feuerwerk
Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf 99 Luftballons

[Strophe 4]
99 Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen, „Krieg!“, und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht?
Dass es einmal so weit kommt
Wegen 99 Luftballons

[Bridge]
Wegen 99 Luftballons
99 Luftballons

[Outro]
99 Jahre Krieg
Ließen keinen Platz für Sieger
Kriegsminister gibt's nicht mehr
Und auch keine Düsenflieger
Heute zieh' ich meine Runden
Seh' die Welt in Trümmern liegen
Hab' 'n Luftballon gefunden
Denk' an dich und lass' ihn fliegen

Each mistake
Oh, you forgave

Learned to trust
Not run away

And now it's solid
Solid as a rock
That's what this love is
That's what we've got, oh, mmm

And nothing's changed it, woo
The thrill is still hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

[Verse 1]

When the sky went gray
Somehow we managed
We had to stick together

You didn't bat an eye
When I made you cry
We knew down the line
We would make it better

Another friend
Got in between
Tried to separate us

Knock, knock on wood
You understood
Love was so new
We did what we had to

We were willing
To take a chance
So, against all odds
We made a start
We got serious
This wouldn't turn to dust

I got it bad
You don't know how bad I got it
You got it easy
You don't know when you've got it good
It's getting harder
Just keeping life and soul together
I'm sick of fighting
Even though I know I should
The cold is biting
Through each and every nerve and fiber
My broken spirit
Is frozen to the core
I don't want to be here no more

[Chorus]
Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
Even if it was for just one day?
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away?
Wouldn't it be good to be on your side?
The grass is always greener over there
Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care?

[Verse 2]
You must be joking
You don't know a thing about it
You've got no problem
I'd stay right there if I were you
I got it harder
You couldn't dream how hard I got it
Stay out of my shoes
If you know what's good for you
The heat is stifling
Burning me up from the inside
The sweat is coming
Through each and every pore
I don't want to be here no more
I don't want to be here no more
I don't want to be here no more

Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes

We belong, we belong to the light

Many times, I tried to tell you
Many times, I cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you
Cut my feelings to the bone
Don't wanna leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit?
Do we distort the facts?
Now, there's no looking forward
Now, there's no turning back
When you say

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
We belong, we belong, we belong together

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere, still you say

We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words, we've both fallen under

Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better

Fool enough too long

Only when you leave

And take this soul away

I only want to make things last
So how could this have gone so fast?
And now you're leaving...
How many times must I learn?
It's only when you've gone that I burn
And now you're leaving...

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)
Whoo

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, lets go

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go

[Verse 2]
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what’s it all for?)
You better live now
'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?

[Guitar intro: Chris Hayes]

[Verse 1]
I've been phoning
A-Night and morning
I heard you say:
""Tell him I'm not home""

Now you're confessing
But I'm still guessing
I've been your fool
For so, so long

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Girl, don't lie
Just to save my feelings
Girl, don't cry
And tell me nothing's wrong

Girl don't try
To make up phony reasons
I'd rather leave
Than never believe

[Chorus 1]
If this is it
Please let me know
If this ain't love
You'd better let me go

If this is it
(Ooh-wap)
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so

[Verse 2]
You've been thinking
And I've been drinking
We both know that it's
Just not right

Now you're pretending
That it's not ending
You'll say anything
To avoid a fight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Girl, don't lie
And tell me that you need me
Girl, don't cry
And tell me nothing's wrong

I'll be all right
A-One way or another
So let me go
Or make me want to stay

[Chorus 2]
If this is it
Please let me know
(Ooh) If this ain't love

You'd better let me go

If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so

[Guitar solo: Chris Hayes]

[Chorus 3]
(Ooh-wap) If this is it
(Ooh-woah) Please let me know
(Ooh) If this ain't love
You'd better let me go

If this is it
I want to know
If this ain't love, baby
Just say so

(If this is it
Please let me know)
I wanna know
(Ooh)
(If this is it)
If this is it
(Please let me know)
I gotta know
(Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Winter's city side, crystal bits of snowflakes
All around my head and in the wind
I had no illusions that I'd ever find a glimpse of
Summer's heatwave in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You did what you did to me, now, it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight, big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, alright, pay then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan
Oh, when you're big in Japan

[Verse 2]
Neon on my naked skin
Passing silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo? Or should I go
And change my point of view for other ugly scenes?

You did what you did to me, now, it's history I see
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight

[Verse 1]
The first time I saw you
Oh, you looked so fine
And I had a feeling
One day you'd be mine
Honey you came along and captured my heart
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm all alone it's you that I miss
Girl a love like yours is hard to resist

[Chorus]
Penny lover, my love's on fire
Penny lover, you're my one desire
Tell me baby could this be true
That I could need someone, like I need you

Nights warm and tender
Lying next to you
Girl I surrender
Oh, what more can I do
I've spent all of my life in search of your love
Now there's one more thing I'd like to say
Don't you ever take your sweet love away
Girl I'll do anything, just please stay

[Bridge]
I don't understand it, oh what's come over me
But I'm not going to worry, no not anymore
Cause when a man's in love, he's only got one story
That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss
With a love like yours, it's hard to resist

[Chorus]
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)

I remember the first time I saw you baby
Penny lover, don't you make me cry
You had the look in your eye, you had the look in your eye, yeah, yeah
Ooh pretty baby

Deny the passenger, who want to get on [x3]
Want to get on
He want to get on
Want to get on

To make a chain of fools
You need a matching pair
One hypocritical fool
And a crowd that's never there
There's anger in the silence
There's wheels upon the jail
A black train built of bones
On a copper rail

[Verse 2]
Company conductor
You need the salt of tears
Falling on a ticket
That no one's used in years
Non-commercial native
It's tattooed in your veins
You're living in a blood bank
And riding on this train

[Verse 3]
The spirit's free, but you always find
Passengers stand and wait in line
Someone in front and someone else behind
But passengers always wait in line

Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling?
Can you picture this?

[Verse 2]
Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

[Chorus]
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

[Verse 3]
Touch, if you will, my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding

And our hearts they beat as one

And passion burns you like never before

Just running my game
Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind

You took your time to come back this time
The grass has grown under your feet
In your absence I changed my mind
And someone else is sitting in your seat

I know that I said there'd be no one else
I know that I said I'd be true
But baby, I've burned out cupid's arrow
And here's the short and the narrow

For a handful of nothing

Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip

Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune

We let them come true

[Chorus]
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers
(War)

[Verse 1]
People fill the world
With narrow confidence
Like a child at birth
A man with no defense
What's mine's my own
I won't give it to you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

[Chorus]
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers
(War)

[Verse 2]
Man is far behind
In the search for something new
Like a Philistine
We're burning witches too
This world of fate
Must be designed for you
It matters what you say
It matters what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

[Chorus]
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers
(War)

(War war war war war
War war war war war
War war war war war
War war war war war
War war war war war)

[Bridge]
After the bird has flown
He walked ten thousand miles back home
You can't do that to me, no
You can't do that to me
You can't do that to me, no
You can't do that to me

(War
War)

[Verse 3]
In this heart of mine
I'll find a place for you
For black or white
For all the children, too

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

[Chorus]
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers

No more war
(War, war is stupid)
Said no more war
(And people are stupid)
Said war
(And love means nothing
In some strange quarters)
I said war
No more war
(War, war is stupid)
Said no more war
(And people are stupid)
Said war
(And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers)

Said no more war
(War, war is stupid
And people are stupid)
I said no more war
(And love means nothing
In some strange quarters)
Senso hant-ai
(War, war is stupid
And people are stupid)
Senso hant-ai
Say no more war
(And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers)
Say no more

No more war
(War, war is stupid)
Say no more war
(And people are stupid
And love means nothing)
Say no more war
(In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid)
And no more war
(And people are stupid)
Oh, war
(And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers)
I said no more war

Dum dum dum

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh (For the longest)
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh (For the longest)
For the longest time

[Verse 1]
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do?
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time

[Verse 2]
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh (For the longest)
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh (For the longest)
For the longest

[Verse 3]
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time

[Bridge]
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right and I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far and it's more than I hoped for

[Verse 4]
Who knows how much further we'll go on?
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

[Bridge]
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself, ""Hold on to your heart""
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far, and it's more than I hoped for

[Verse 5]
I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time

[Outro]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh (For the longest)
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh (For the longest)
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh (For the longest)
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh (For the longest)
For the longest time
Whoa, oh, oh (For the longest)

The wild boys are calling
On their way back from the fire
In august moon's surrender to
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside
In a sore afraid new world

They tried to break us
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it

Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while
You're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over
Secrets they could tell

They tried to tame you
Looks like they'll try again

I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Feels like fire
I'm so in love with you
Dreams are like angels
They keep bad at bay, bad at bay
Love is the light
Scaring darkness away

I'm so in love with you
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on, burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

I'll protect you from the hooded claw
Keep the vampires from your door
When the chips are down, I'll be around
With my undying, death-defying love for you
Envy will hurt itself
Let yourself be beautiful
Sparkling love, flowers
And pearls and pretty girls
Love is like an energy
Rushin', rushin' inside of me

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on, burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

This time, we go sublime
Lovers entwine, divine, divine
Love is danger, love is pleasure
Love is pure, the only treasure

I'm so in love with you
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
The power of love
A force from above
A sky-scraping dove

Purge the soul
Make love your goal

Keep the vampires from your door

On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
(All your life) All your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you
But you was living in another world trying to get your message through

[Pre-Chorus]
No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head

Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway

[Verse 2]
Take a line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time
So you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you
You know she likes the lights at nights on the neon Broadway signs
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find

Ooh, she's a little runaway

[Verse 1: Peter Cetera]
I guess I thought you'd be here
Forever
Another illusion
I chose to create
You don't know what you got
Until it's gone
And I found out
A little too late

[Verse 2: Bill Champlin, with bandmates]
I was acting as if
You were lucky to have me
Doing you a favor
I hardly knew you were there
But then you were gone
And it was all wrong
Had no idea how much I cared

[Chorus: Peter Cetera, with bandmates, Bill Champlin]
Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to
Being without you
It's all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you, babe
You're a hard habit to break

[Verse 3: Peter Cetera, with bandmates]
You found someone else
You had every reason
Know I can't blame you
For running to him
Two people together
But living alone
I was spreading my love too thin

[Verse 4: Bill Champlin, with bandmates (Peter Cetera)]
After all of these years
I'm still trying to shake it
Doing much better (They say that it just takes time)
But deep in the night
It's an endless fight
I can't get you out of my mind

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to

You're a hard habit to break

All of my defenses down
Your camera looks through me
With its X-ray vision

Every word I intended to speak
Winds up locked in a circuitry

Well you've shown me you can take, you've got some giving to do

Then how can it be good enough for two?

When all I could see was the end of the week

Walking in, and out of that door
Like a stranger, but the wages

Nights in the scullery

To keep from burning history
Seasons of gasoline and gold

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?
People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?

[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
So we're different colours and we're different creeds
And different people have different needs
It's obvious you hate me, though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you, so what could I have done?

[Pre-Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
Now you're punching and you're kicking and you're shouting at me
I'm relying on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced, but I'm sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel from your head to your fists

I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand

I used to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello, until that first smile
But if i had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing
Cause this love is everlasting

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

Ooh yeah

Girl you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough
To say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before
Now you're all I'm living for

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

Each day I pray, this love affair would last forever
Oh hoh

Run down the boardwalk
Stop and make small talk

I can't say no I can't say yes
I can't even write down my own address
I can't touch Heaven it's a little too far

Wondering where you are
Moving through the landscape at a million miles an hour

Across every nation
From the harbour to the station
It's a form of inspiration
It's a power to the state
They run down the railways
Sail across the seaways
Fly through the airways
But they can't say no
To you

I can't stand up I can't stand still
I know you wouldn't like it if I told you how I feel
I just want to say that it's only common sense
But the words always fail me at my own expense

Wearing white as you're walkin'
Down the street of my soul

Make a bad one good make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

You're the one that wants to hold her
Hold her and control her
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
Oh she'll say that there's no other
Till she finds another
Better forget it
Oh you'll regret it

[Verse 1]
Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

[Chorus 1]
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Verse 2]
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe, I'm gonna get you back
I'm going to show you what I'm made of

[Chorus 2]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

[Chorus 3]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down and the
Radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Chorus 4]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

One, two
One, two, three, uh!

[Verse 1]
I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door
She wore a...

[Chorus]
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

[Verse 2]
Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks
She wore a...

[Chorus]
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

[Verse 3]
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

[Chorus]
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Out of the ruins

In your little corner of the world?

With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow

And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

385,Chain Reaction,Eaten Alive,Diana Ross,1985-09-24,230533,59,"

You took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do
And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You took a little, then you took me over
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying, trying, anything for you

I'm in the middle of a chain reaction
You give me all the after midnight action
I wanna get you where I can let you make all that love to me
I'm on a journey for the inspiration
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation
I need you to get me nearer to you
So you can set me free
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love

You make me tremble when your hand moves lower
You taste a little then you swallow slower
Nature has a way of yielding treasure
Pleasure made for you, oh
You gotta plan, your future is on the run
Shine a light for the whole world over
You never find your love if you hide away
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is

Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
I wanna get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
Instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you
With no more left to say
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love
You let me hold you for the first explosion
My arms will cover you all you gotta do

Get in the middle of a chain reaction (chain reaction)
You get a medal when you're lost in action (lost in action)
Don't pass me by
I wanna get your love all ready
For the sweet sensation, instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion

My arms will cover, my lips will smother you
Sooner or later all you gotta do is
Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
I wanna get your love all ready
For the sweet sensation, instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion

I hear a lot of stories
I suppose they could be true
All about love and what it can do to you
Highest risk of striking out
The risk of getting hurt
And still, I have so much to learn

I know, 'cause I think about it all the time
I know, that real love has quite a price

And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

My expectations may be high
I blamed it on my youth
Soon enough, I'll learned the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter
Then boast of how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone

I know, 'cause I learn a little every day
I know, 'cause I listen when the experts say

That a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

As I look back on all my childhood dreams
My ideas of love weren't
As foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now
I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days, it's hard to find

I know, it's a dream I'm willing to defend
I know, it will all be worth it in the end

And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

And a good heart, these days, is hard to find (a good heart)
True love, the lasting kind
A good heart, these days, is hard to find
So please be gentle with this, with this heart of mine

A good heart
A good heart

A good heart
A good heart

How - how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often
But making mistakes is a part
Of life's imperfections born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear the time
That told the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
Don't want to be without you

And yet, I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

[Pre-Chorus]
And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

[Chorus]
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

[Verse 2]
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that, alone, I'd never find

[Pre-Chorus]
And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

[Chorus]
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

You could see it written in his eyes
As the train rolled out of sight
Bye-bye

403,I Know Him So Well,Love Hurts,Elaine Paige,1985,257106,52,"

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
Wanting far too much
For far too long

Looking back
I could have played it differently
Won a few more moments
Who can tell
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know
I know him well

Wasn't it good?
(Oh so good)
Wasn't he fine?
(Oh so fine)
Isn't it madness
He can't be mine?
But in the end
He needs a little bit
More than me
More security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well

No-one in your life is with you constantly
No-one is completely on your side
And though I'd move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide

Looking back
(Looking back)
I could have played it differently
(I could have played it some other way)
Learned about the man
Before I fell
(I was just a little careless)
But I was ever so much younger then
(Maybe, so much younger then)
Now at least I know
I know him well

Wasn't it good?
(Oh so good)
Wasn't he fine?
(Oh so fine)
Isn't it madness
He won't be mine?

Didn't I know?
How it would go
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart?

Wasn't it good
Wasn't he fine?
Isn't it madness
He won't be mine?

But in the end
He needs a little bit
More than me
More security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
It took time to understand him

I know him so well

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms

[Verse 2]
Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms

[Bridge]
There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms

Ain't nothin' else matters

And that's all - yeah

When your heart has been broken
Hard words have been spoken
It ain't easy - but it's only love

And if your life ain't worth livin'
And you're ready to give in
Just remember - that it's only love

You can live without the aggravation
Ya gotta wanna win - ya gotta wanna win

Over and over and over again

Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding all through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls that I'd once made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

[Chorus]
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

[Verse 2]
Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

This prison has now become your home
A sentence you seem prepared to pay
It took a day to build the city

I recognized the fields where I'd once played
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge

Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just look back and see
Love don't live here anymore

When you lived inside of me
There was nothing in the world
You wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
Then you changed and went away

And you abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just look back and see
Love don't live here anymore

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
Why'd you have to go away
Found another place to stay

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just look back and see
Love don't live here anymore, YEAH!

Through the windows of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Don't you know i need you so
Why'd ya have to go

And abandon me
Love don't live here anymore
Just look back and see that
Love don't live here anymore

Yeah
Don't live here anymore
Love don't live here
Love don't live here anymore
Anymore
You went away and left me
Now love don't live here anymore
Love
Don't
Live here

[Verse 1]
We're not scared to lose it all, security thrown through the wall
Future dreams we have to realise
A thousand sceptic hands won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize

[Chorus]
And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better

Treating today as though it was the last, the final show
Get to 60 and feel no regret
It may take a little time, a lonely path, an uphill climb
Success or failure will not alter it

And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better

A few stolen moments, is all that we shared
You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I try to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

But each time I try, I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue

Love gives you the right to be free
You said, ""Be patient, just wait a little longer.""
But that's just an old fantasy

Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door

In Europe and America
There’s a growing feeling of hysteria
Conditioned to respond to all the threats
In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets
Mr. Khrushchev said we will bury you
I don’t subscribe to this point of view
It would be such an ignorant thing to do
If the Russians love their children too

[Verse 2]
How can I save my little boy
From Oppenheimer's most deadly toy?
There is no monopoly of common sense
On either side of the political fence

[Chorus]
We share the same biology
Regardless of ideology
Believe me when I say to you
I hope the Russians love their children too

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
There is no historical precedent
To put the words in the mouth of the president
There’s no such thing as a winnable war
It’s a lie we don’t believe anymore
Mr. Reagan says we will protect you
I don’t subscribe to this point of view
Believe me when I say to you
I hope the Russians love their children too

[Chorus]
We share the same biology
Regardless of ideology
What might save us me and you
Is if the Russians love their children too

On the way to the top
But there's something that you forgot

Don't let it slip away
What about love

Look back on your life

It doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
It makes no difference if you're black or if you're white
All men are equal till the victory is won
No color or religion ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

It doesn't matter if you're left or to the right
Don't try to hide behind the cause for which you fight
There'll be no prisoners taken when the day is done
No flag no uniform ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

There's no communication
No one to take the blame
The cries of every nation
They're falling on deaf ears again

Out in the fields
Out in the fields, they are falling one by one
Out in the fields, no flag has ever stopped a bullet from a gun
Death is just a heartbeat away

Out in the fields, a heartbeat away
Out in the fields, death is just a heartbeat away

I really wasn't sure
What was going on

[Chorus]
N-n-n-n-nineteen, nineteen
N-nineteen, nineteen

In Vietnam, the combat soldier
Typically served a twelve month tour of duty
But was exposed to hostile fire almost everyday

[Chorus]
N-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-nineteen

In Saigon, a US miltary spokesman
Said today, more than 720 troops
Were killed last week in
That sensitive border area
In all of South Vietnam
The enemy lost a total of
2,689 soldiers

[Bridge]
All those who remember the war
They won't forget what they've seen
Destruction of men in their prime
Whose average age was nineteen

D-d-d-d-d-destruction
D-d-d-d-d-destruction

According to a Veteran's Administration study
Half of the Vietnam combat veterans suffered
From what psychiatrists call
Post traumatic stress disorder
Many vets complain of alienation, rage, or guilt
Some succumb to suicidal thoughts
Eight to ten years after coming home
Almost eight-hundred-thousand men
Are still fighting the Vietnam War

None of them received
A hero's welcome

Saigon, Saigon
S-s-s-s-s-Saigon
S-s-s-s-s-Saigon
Nineteen, s-s-s-s-Saigon
N-n-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-n-nineteen

Vietnam, S-s-saigon
Vietnam, S-s-saigon
Vietnam, S-s-saigon

[Verse 1]
I still dream of Orgonon
I wake up crying
You're making rain
And you're just in reach
When you and sleep escape me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're like my yo-yo
That glowed in the dark
What made it special
Made it dangerous
So I bury it
And forget

[Chorus 1]
But every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen

[Verse 2]
On top of the world, looking over the edge
You could see them coming
You looked too small
In their big black car
To be a threat to the men in power

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I hid my yo-yo
In the garden
I can't hide you
From the government
Oh, God, Daddy
I won't forget

[Chorus 2]
'Cause every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen

[Interlude]

[Chorus 3]
And every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Look, your son's coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen, oh
Ooh, just saying it could even make it happen

443,Small Town,Scarecrow,John Mellencamp,1985,221626,66,"

Well, I was born in a small town
And I live in a small town
Probably die in a small town
Oh, those small communities

All my friends are so small town
My parents live in the same small town
My job is so small town
Provides little opportunity

Educated in a small town
Taught to fear Jesus in a small town
Used to daydream in that small town
Another boring romantic, that's me

But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town
Now she's small town just like me

No, I cannot forget from where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town
And people let me be just what I want to be

Got nothing against a big town
Still hayseed enough to say, ""look who's in the big town""
But my bed is in a small town
Oh, and that's good enough for me

Well, I was born in a small town
And I can breathe in a small town
Gonna die in this small town
Oh that's probably where they'll bury me

Inside everyone hides one desire
Outside no one would know
Danger close to edge of the knife
Safer not to let go
And while we miss chances
You can almost hear time slipping away

We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes to time slipping away

No show, Wednesday girl waits with the wine
She knows just what to say
While no one listens
You can almost hear time slipping away

We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes and

We can talk to strangers
We are burning with the spark
And we can walk on water
We are tigers in the dark
We are burning

We close our eyes

Heroes never give into the night
He knows how far he can run
And as he surrenders
You can almost hear time slipping away

We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes

We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes

We close our eyes, we walk on water
Lets us take the blame
We are burning
Talk to strangers

446,All She Wants To Do Is Dance,Building The Perfect Beast,Don Henley,1984-01-01,269106,58,"

They're pickin' up the prisoners
And putting 'em in a pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

Rebels been rebels
Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance

Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance

Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance

Wild-eyed pistol-wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat
Comin off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance

Well the government bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

To keep the boys from sellin'
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance

But that don't keep the boys
From makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance

Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout
They said, ""Don't come back here, Yankee""
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money

'Cause all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
All she wants to do is dance

To turn me back to the one

Callers as though they were Christmas Eve
Disappointed and I don't know why?
She gave me laughter and hope
And a sock in the eye
(A love like this is sealed with a kiss)

In my young life and I know something now
I've never tried to create a wow
Wows are few frustration more common
Now I can feel it in my soul
That's why I gave the come on

Kiss me with your mouth
Your love is better than wine
But wine is all I have
Will your love ever be mine?

Faces fall before my feet
Like blood onto a clean white sheet
When I grow old I won't forget
To innocence my only debt

Wow I feel so fresh today
Barefoot in the snow to make love in the hay
The stars are bright in the abyss
Now I can feel you in my arms
I explode inside your kiss

What is happening here
Something going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the light
We're gonna have a party, it's starting tonight

Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling

The room is hot and that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
The people starting to climb the walls
Oooh, it looks like everybody is having a ball

Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling.  Ah
Oh, oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Come on!
Whoo!
Alright

Everybody starts to lose control when the music is right
If you see somebody hanging around, don't get uptight
The only thing we wanna do tonight
Is go round and round and turn upside down
Come on, let's get down!

(Cheering)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey.......(Cheering)

So come on and get loose
Don't hold back 'cause it ain't no use
Hard to keep your feet on the ground
'Cause when we like to party, we only wanna get down

Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling.  Ah
Oh, what a feeling, baby, when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling.  Whoa!

Say what?
Can't stop now, just getting started
Everybody clap your hands.  (Clapping)
Come on!
Everybody let's dance!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling when we're dancing on the ceiling

Hey
What?
Listen

[Verse 1]
I've had other guys, I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before until you walked through my door
I've had other lips, I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go, you're the one for me, baby
This I know, 'cause it's...

[Chorus]
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

[Verse 2]
I've heard all the lines, I've cried oh-so-many times
Those teardrops, they won't fall again, I'm so excited, 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear, those words whispered in your ear
I said...

[Chorus]
True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove

It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy
Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Steve Winwood]
Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

[Chorus]
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

[Verse 2]
Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above on a higher love

[Bridge 1]
I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
Bring it

[Organ Solo 1]

[Bridge 2]
I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

Oh

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

[Verse 1]
I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

[Chorus]
The lady in red is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here
It's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

[Verse 2]
I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing
I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away
And I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

[Chorus]
The lady in red is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here
It's just you and me
It's where I want to be
Well, I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

[Outro]
I never will forget the way you look tonight
The lady in red
The lady in red
The lady in red
My lady in red
I love you

I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

[Bridge]
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

465,These Dreams,Heart,Heart,1985-07-06,254476,60,"

Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist
Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Is it cloak 'n dagger
Could it be spring or fall
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist
The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

[Hook]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away

[Verse 2]
Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

[Hook]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss

It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong

[Verse 1]
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

[Chorus]
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

[Chorus]
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

[Outro]
And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love

[Verse 1]
I'm not proud, I was wrong
And the truth is hard to take
I felt sure we had enough
But our love went overboard
Lifeboat lies lost at sea
I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

For restless eyes, egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
And love is overboard
Heavy hearts, token words
All the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love
If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah
Lessons in love

[Bridge]
Lost without love
Lessons in love
When will you ever learn
Lessons in love
When there's nowhere left to turn
Lessons in love
Don't let your spirit burn
Lessons in love
I'll wait 'till you return

All the dreams that we were building
We never lived them
We could use it, we should use it, yeah (Lessons in love)

Could be better, should be better

The wind blows hard against this mountain side
Across the sea into my soul
It reaches into where I cannot hide
Setting my feet upon the road

My heart is old, it holds my memories
My body burns a gemlike flame
Somewhere between the soul and soft machine
Is where I find myself again

Of what my life would mean to me
Would I have followed down my chosen road

Believe me the sun always shines on TV
Hold me close to your heart
Touch me and give all your love to me, to me

Nothing there to ease the pressure of my ever worrying mind
All my powers waste away

474,Don't Give Up,So (Remastered),Peter Gabriel,1986-05-19,394826,59,"

[Verse 1: Peter Gabriel]
In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail
No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose

[Chorus: Kate Bush]
Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up, you're not beaten yet
Don't give up, I know you can make it good

[Verse 2: Peter Gabriel]
Though I saw it all around
Never thought that I could be affected
Thought that we'd be last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

[Chorus: Kate Bush]
Don't give up, you still have us
Don't give up, we don't need much of anything
Don't give up, 'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong

[Bridge: Kate Bush & Peter Gabriel]
Rest your head, you worry too much
It's going to be alright
When times get rough, you can fall back on us
Don't give up, please don't give up
Got to walk out of here, I can't take any more
Gonna stand on that bridge, keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come and whatever may go
That river's flowing, that river's flowing

[Verse 3: Peter Gabriel]
Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no-one needs

[Chorus: Kate Bush]
Don't give up 'cause you have friends
Don't give up, you're not the only one
Don't give up, no reason to be ashamed
Don't give up, you still have us
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up 'cause I believe there's a place
There's a place where we belong

Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up

I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street
Now did you read the news today
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
There burning into the night
There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?
Well this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in
Ooh, Superman where are you now
When everything's gone wrong somehow?
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour
This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why, this is a land of confusion
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in
I remember long ago when the sun was shining
Yes, and the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight, so long ago
I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know, we'll never keep
Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see, this is a land of confusion?
Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to

You take my breath away
Love thinks it's here to stay
There's still so much for me to do
And I can't stop loving you
Oh, can this be true

If you could see what I have seen
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Then I wake up and you're not there
Pain finds me everywhere
Oh, but you don't care

Don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break
I have loved you for so long
It's all I can take

You, you take my breath away
Love thinks it's here to stay
Still so much for me to do

The hardest part is when you're in it
I've been in love before

Just one touch, just one look
A dangerous dance
One small word can make me feel
Like running away
You can't say you're in it, no, until you reach the limit

[Verse 1]
I used to be a renegade, I used to fool around
But I couldn't take the punishment and had to settle down
Now I'm playing it real straight, and yes, I cut my hair
You might think I'm crazy, but I don't even care
Because I can tell what's going on

[Abridged Chorus]
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square

[Verse 2]
I like my bands in business suits, I watch them on TV
I'm working out most every day and watching what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me, but I don't even care
I know that it's crazy
I know that it's nowhere
But there is no denying that

[Chorus]
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
It's not too hard to figure out, you see it every day
And those that were the farthest out have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway, it don't look like a lot of fun
But don't you try to fight it, an idea whose time has come
Don't tell me that I'm crazy
Don't tell me I'm nowhere
Take it from me

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square
Tell 'em, boys

Through these misty eyes, I see lonely skies
Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family and my country?
Heaven knows where I belong

Pack my bags tonight, here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train in the pouring rain
Say farewell but don't say goodbye

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine just for Auld Lang Syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now in my darkest hour
And the way our arms entwine

[Chorus]
Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark

And we'll drink a toast to the blood red rose
Cheer a while the Emerald Isle
And to the northern lights and the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart

Days pass, and this emptiness fills my heart

501,Camouflage,The Big Heat,Stan Ridgway,1993-01-01,437733,47,"

[Instrument Intro]

[Verse 1]
I was a PFC on a search patrol huntin' Charlie down
It was in the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone
And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside
Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
And then a big marine, a giant with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said wait
When he came in close beside me he said
""Don't worry, son, I'm here
If Charlie wants to tangle now he'll have two to dodge.""
I said, ""Well thanks a lot.""
I told him my name and asked him his
And he said, ""The boys just call me Camouflage.""

[Chorus]
Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camoufalge
I was awfully glad to see this big marine

[Verse 2]
Well I was gonna ask him where he came from
When we heard the bullets fly
Coming through the brush
And all around our ears
It was then I saw this big Marine light a fire in his eye
And it was strange but suddenly I forgot my fears

[Verse 3]
Well, we fought all night side by side we took our battle stance
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
Cause they seemed to go right through him
As if he wasn't there
And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran

[Verse 4]
And it was near the river bank when the ambush came on top of us
And I'd thought it was the end and we were had
Then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin' through a bush
And that big marine he just swatted it with his hand
Just like it was a fly

[Chorus]
Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage
This was an awfully strange Marine

[Verse 5]
And I knew there was something weird about him
Cause when I turned around he was pullin' a big palm tree
Right up out of the ground
And swattin' those Charlies with it from here to Kingdom Come
When he led me out of danger
I saw my camp and waved goodbye
He just winked at me from the jungle and then was gone
And when I got back to my HQ, I told 'em about my night
And the battle I'd spent with a big marine named Camouflage

[Verse 6]
When I said his name a soldier gulped
And a medic took my arm
And led me to a green tent on the right
He said, ""You may be tellin' the truth boy
But this here is Camouflage
And he's been right here since he passed away last night.""
In fact, he's been here all week long
But before he went he said, ""Semper Fi,""
And said his only wish
Was to save a young marine caught in a barrage
So here, take his dog tag, son
I know he'd want you to have it now.""
And we both said a prayer for a big marine named Camouflage

[Chorus]
Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage
This was an awfully big marine

[Verse 7]
So next time you're in a jungle fight
And you feel the presence near
Or hear a voice that in your mind will lie
Just be thankful that you're not alone
And you got some company
From a big Marine the boys called Camouflage

[Chorus]
Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage
This was an awfully big Marine

[Chorus]
Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage
This was an awfully big Marine

Down in Southside Birmingham

Tryna get through the night

Join the chosen few, hey

Is to get it better than today

Only love can make a memory
Only love can make a moment last
You were there and all the world was young
And all it's songs unsung
And I remember you then, when love was all
All you were living for
And how you gave that love to me
Only then I felt my heart was free
I was part of you and you were all of me

Warm were the days and the nights of those years
Painted in colors to outshine the sun
All of the words and the dreams
And the tears live in my remembrance

Only love can make a memory
Only love can make a moment last
Life was new, there was a rage to live
Each day a page to live
And I remember you then
When love was all, all you were living for
And how you gave that love to me
Only then I knew my heart was free
I was part of you and you were all of me

With pipe dreams in their heads and very little money in their hands

They ain't too proud to sleep on your floor tonight
With the blind faith of Jesus, you know that they just might
Rocking in the U.S.A

Filled our head full of dreams and turned our world upside down

[Verse 1: Rev Run, D.M.C., & Both]
Now there's a backseat lover that's always undercover
And I talk 'til my daddy say
Said, ""You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin""
""And there's sure to be a change in ways""
Now, there's a cheerleader that's a real big bleeder
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this

[Chorus: Rev Run, D.M.C., & Both]
See-saw swinging with the boys in school
And her feet was flying up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle with the kitty in the middle""
And they swinging like it just don't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Rev Run]
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Well, just gimme a kiss
Ooh, like this

[Verse 2: Rev Run, D.M.C., & Both]
School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt hanging way up her knee
It was three young ladies in the school gym locker
And they found they were looking at D
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
That my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
And I gave the girl a little kiss, like this

[Chorus: Steven Tyler, Steven Tyler & Run-D.M.C.]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle, with your kitty in the middle""
I was swinging like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin' when she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to

[Chorus:  Steven Tyler & Rev Run]
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)

He only tells her
That she's the flowers, the wind and spring
In all her splendour sweetly surrendering
The love that innocence brings

Almaz, so pure and simple
Born in a world where love survives
Now men will want her
And life don't haunt her
Almaz, You lucky lucky thing

Now I watch closely
And I watch wholly
I can't imagine love so rare
She's young and tender
But will life bend her
I look around is she everywhere

Almaz, so pure and simple
Born in a world where love survives
Now men will want her
And life don't haunt her

She shares his wishes
I'm sure he's keen without a doubt

[Intro]
""What's up, girl?""
""He stood me up again""
""Again?""
""Mmhmm""
""Well, what's up with this guy?
Do you really like him that much?""
""Yes honey, I love him, he is fun
He does a lot of nice things for me""
I know he used to do nice stuff for you
But what has he done for you lately?

[Verse 1]
Used to be a time when you would pamper me
Used to brag about it all the time
Your friends seem to think that you're so peachy keen
But my friends say neglect is on your mind
Who's right?

What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Used to go to dinner almost every night
Dancing 'til I thought I'd lose my breath (Ah)
Now it seems your dancing feet are always on my couch
Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death
Ain't that a shame?

What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

I never ask for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this Earth
I'm telling you, no way
You ought to be thankful for the little things
But little things are all you seem to give
You're always putting off what we can do today
Soap opera says, you've got one life to live
Who's right, who's wrong?

What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
What have you done for me lately?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

Do you really want to know
Just how long love will last?

The truth is in our hearts
Here we are together

Sometimes the road gets hard to travel
Sometimes the pain's too much to bear
Sometimes when life seems to unravel
That's the time oh to say
We're going to make it anyway
Can't you see that?

[Huckleberry Finn]
Did the morning come too early?
Was the night not long enough?
Does a tear of hesitation fall on
Everything you touch?

Well, it might just be a lesson
For the hasty heart to know
Maybe leavin's not the only way to go

[Mary Jane Wilkes]
Maybe lay and let your feelings
Grow accustomed to the dark
And, by morning's light, you just might solve
The problems of the heart

And it all might be a lesson
For the hasty heart to know
Maybe leavin's not the only way to go

[Jim and Mary Jane]
People reach new understandings all the time
They take a second look
Maybe change their minds

[Huck, Jim, and Mary Jane]
People reach new understandings every day
Tell me not to reach

[Huckleberry Finn]
And I'll go away

Did the morning come too early?
Was the night not long enough?

Does a tear of hesitation fall on

Well, it might just be a lesson

Maybe leavin's not the only way to go

And a heart without a home
Is such a lonesome row to hoe
Maybe leavin's not the only way to go

And now it chills me to the bone

How do I get you alone?

How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
Alone, alone

[Verse 1]
If I had to live my life
Without you near me
The days would all be empty
The nights would seem so long

With you I see forever oh so clearly
I might have been in love before
But it never felt this strong

Our dreams are young and we both know
They'll take us where we want to go
Hold me now
Touch me now
I don't want to live without you

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through
But nothing's gonna change my love for you

[Verse 2]
If the road ahead is not so easy
Our love will lead the way for us
Like a guiding star

I'll be there for you
If you should need me
You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are

So come with me and share the view
I'll help you see forever too
Hold me now, touch me now
I don't want to live without you

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through
But nothing's gonna change my love for you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
The world may change my whole life through
But nothing's gonna change my love for you

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
You ought to know by now how much I love you
One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love

Nothing's gonna change my love for you

Oh, its a long time since I saw you
Well you know how time can fly
It seems like yesterday we were lovers
Now we pass each other by

But if we're left alone tonight, don't ask me to hold you tight
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak, weak in the presence of beauty

All my friends, keep asking
Why I'm quiet while you're around?
They dont know I think I'm so lucky to stop myself from falling down

So later if you're on your own
Don't ask me to take you home
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak, weak in the presence of beauty

Cause if were left alone tonight
I'll have no choice but to hold you tight
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak
I go weak, weak in the presence of beauty

I go weak, darling, I love you
I go weak, theres no doubt about it
I go weak
I go weak, weak in the presence of beauty
I go weak, youre my world
I go weak, I used to be your girl
I go weak
I go weak
Weak in the presence of beauty...

[Verse 1]
There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

[Verse 2]
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

[Chorus]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
You know they won't win

Don't let them win
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Don't let them win
They come, they come
Don't let them win
Hey now, hey now (yeah)
Hey now,  hey now

My name is Luka
I live on the second floor

If you hear something late at night
Some kind of trouble, some kind of fight
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was
Just don't ask me what it was

I think it's 'cause I'm clumsy
I try not to talk too loud
Maybe it's because I'm crazy
I try not to act too proud

And after that, you don't ask why
You just don't argue anymore
You just don't argue anymore

Yes, I think I'm okay
Walked into the door again
Well, if you ask, that's what I'll say
And it's not your business anyway

I guess I'd like to be alone
With nothing broken, nothing thrown
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am
Just don't ask me how I am

[Verse 1]
Debonair lullabies
In melodies revealed
In deep despair on lonely nights
He knows just how you feel
The slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits
In miracles made real

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

[Chorus]
When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
The front door might slam
But the back door it rings
And Smokey sings, he sings

[verse 2]
Elegance in eloquence
For sale or rent or hire
Should I say yes and match his best
Then I would be a liar
Symphonies that soothe the rage
When lovers' hearts catch fire

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And everything's good in the world tonight

When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
Smashing the hell
With the heaven she brings
Then Smokey sings, he sings

Luther croons
Sly's the original originator
James screams
Marvin was the only innovator
But nothing can compare
Nothing can compare

When Smokey sings, I hear violins
When Smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
She threw back the ring
When Smokey sings

Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory

Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
And was crippled emotionally

Somehow I made it through the heartache, yes I did
I escaped (ahaha)
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me, uh huh

With and endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet

And like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

No, I don't regret a single moment, no I don't
(I know you don't) Looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me (oh)
I knew you were waiting (hey)
Knew you were waiting for me

So we were drawn together through destiny
Ooh, boy (ooh)
I know this love we share was meant to be (oh)

Knew you were waiting (Ooh, yeah)
Knew you were waiting (I knew you were waiting)
Knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter (I didn't falter, no)
I still believed (When the valley was low)
It didn't stop me (Nothing can stop me, no)
I knew you were waiting (No I)
Knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter (When the mountain was high)
I still believed (Oh, when the valley was low)
It didn't stop me (No, it didn't stop me, no)
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me

I didn't falter (Oh, oh yeah)
I still believed (I still believed)
It didn't stop me (You know it couldn't stop me now)
Knew you were waiting
Someday (Someday), somehow (somehow)
For me

I didn't falter (When the valley was low)
I still believed (I still believed)

536,Mary's Prayer,Meet Danny Wilson,Danny Wilson,1987-01-01,234466,58,"

Everything is wonderful
Being here is heavenly
Every single day, she says
Everything is free

I used to be so careless
As if I couldn't care less
Did I have to make mistakes
When I was Mary's prayer?

Suddenly, the heavens roared
Suddenly, the rain came down
Suddenly was washed away
The Mary that I knew

So when you find somebody who keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake
When I was Mary's prayer

So if I say save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven for me

Blessed is the one who shares
Your power and your beauty, Mary
Blessed is the millionaire
Who shares your wedding day

So when you find somebody who keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake
When I was Mary's prayer

So if I say save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven

Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven for me

If you want the fruit to fall
You have to give the tree a shake
But if you shake the tree too hard
The bough is gonna break

And if I can't reach the top of the tree
Oh, Mary, you can pull me up there
What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer

So if I say save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven

Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven

Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer

What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer
Save me (What I wouldn't give to be)

What are those words whispered, baby, just as you turn away
I saw you last night out on the edge of town
I wanna read your mind to know just what I've got in this new thing I've found

So tell me what I see when I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

I heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow
Well I've tried so hard, baby, but I just can't see
What a woman like you is doing with me

So tell me who I see when I look in your eyes
Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

Now look at me, baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
When out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself

[Verse 3]
Now you play the loving woman, I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close into the palm of my hand
We stood at the altar, the gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours, well maybe, baby, the gypsy lied

So when you look at me, you better look hard and look twice
Is that me, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

Tonight our bed is cold
I'm lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man
Who doubts what he's sure of

A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us

I pay the price for cheap advice

Sick of leaving in the morning
With the night you gave away
So now I’m gonna take that all that I can get
With those angel eyes
You make saints do sins all the time

Say I’m gonna stay, home and away, well well
When I said I’d catch you when you’re falling
I’d have my heart open wide
And you who’s not naive I thought
Say I’d thought I’d mend my heart

People say I’m so automatic
People say I’m not so systematic
When I’m down I’m in manual, Lord
And time and time again I walk on by
With the look of love

And with those angel eyes, woh woh
You set me on fire baby
And with those angel eyes, woh woh
C’mon now baby

The saddest thing I’ve ever seen on my TV screen
Was the dying man who died for his dream
The toughest thing I’ve ever heard
Was that new-born scream in this naked world

People say I’m not so systematic
When I’m down I’m in manual, Lord
And time and time again I walk on by

Gonna tell the world
Gonna tell the world
Gonna tell the world

Gonna tell the world
Gonna tell the world
Gonna tell the world

Say I’m gonna stay home and away
Should a little loving gotta make you smile girl
Say I’m gonna stay home and away

People say that I’m so automatic
People say I’m not so systematic
When I’m down I’m in manual, Lord
Been all around those edges
But ain’t never been in love
Ain’t never been in love before babe
Never been in love
Never been in love

Set me on fire, baby

And with those angel eyes, woh woh
Set me on fire, fire

And with those angel eyes
And with those angel eyes
And with those angel eyes

Another day is ended
And I still can't sleep
Remembering my yesterdays
I begin to weep
If I could have it over
Live my life again
I wouldn't change a single day

I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days when life was so much better

Lying here in silence
Picture in my hand
Of a boy I still resemble
But I no longer understand
And as the tears run freely
How I realise they were the best years of my life

I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days when life was so much better

You might say it's just
A case of giving up
No
But without these memories where is the love
(So) Where is the love?

If I could have it over
Live my life again
I wouldn't change a single day

I wish that I could turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days when life was so much better

Why can't I turn back the clock
Bring the wheels of time to a stop
Back to the days
Oh no no
I remember when
Life was so good
I'd go back if I could

Oh oh I wouldn't change a single day
Don't let the memories slip away
I wouldn't change a single day
Don't let the memories slip away

And I can't wait to see you again
So I can hold you in my arms

Watch out!

[Verse 1]
I see you on the street, and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance
You'd see my desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

For something I want
Don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad, boy, I wonder why
I follow you around, but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice

Well, I've got something to say

You sheltered me from harm
Kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me
Set me free, you set me free

Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you

I would give everything I own
Give up me life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again

You taught me how to cry
I don't know why, just don't know why
You told those lies to me
You set me free, you set me free

Of all the years I ever knew
Those finer ones I spent with you

I would give everything I own
Give up me life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to hold you once again

If there's someone you know
That won't let you go
And taking it all for granted

You may lose them one day
Someone takes them away
And you don't hear a word they say

I would give everything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home
I would give everything I own
Just to have you back again
Just to hold you once again

I would give everything I own
Give up my life, my heart, my home

And found the future not so bright

Feel like I could run away, run away

Our dad would send us to our room
He'd be the voice of doom
He said that we would thank him later
All day, he was solid as a rock
But by eight o'clock
We'd be crumbling

One night, my brother Joe and me
Climbed down the family tree
That grew outside our bedroom window
We ran, though we knew it couldn't last
Running from the past
From things that we were born to be

Looking back, it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
On the back seat of the car
With Joseph and Emily
We only see so far
And we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back, it's so bizarre

Dad rang the officer in charge
A man so large
He barely fit his circumstances
He said two kids out on the street
Were picked up on the beat
And in the station

So there's me, with Emily and Joe
Daddy driving home
All heading in the same direction
He knew, no matter what the breaks
We'd make the same mistakes
Couldn't take his eyes of Joe and me

Looking back, it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
On the back seat of the car
With Joseph and Emily
We only see so far
And we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back, it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
Looking back, it's so bizarre

Like a dream within a dream
We're all somewhere in between
Like a drummer plays his drum
Like a father, like a son

And your gonna have to face the music, oh yeah
Face the music

Hey hey, we keep it running in the family
Hey hey, we keep it coming in the family

Looking back, it's so bizarre
It runs in the family
All the things we are
On the back seat of the car
With Joseph and Emily
We only see so far
'Cause we all have our daddy's eyes
Looking back, it's so bizarre, whoa yeah
Running in the family

And we all have our daddy's eyes

In a fleeting moment of a restless day
Driven to distraction, I was captured by the game
I have often wondered why I ever wanted to
Leave these scattered hours behind me and speed myself to you

I choose never to forget
I want our lips to kiss and our limbs to entwine
Let our bodies be twisted but never our minds

Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?

Set to work idle hands, shake these thoughts had I planned them
They never would be teasing me as viciously as these

I would not have believed you had I never seen
Now you and I are intimately pictured in my dreams
I could not forsake you or fall tumbling away
And if I live in wonderland, I'm better off this way

I choose never to forget
I want our lips to kiss and our limbs to entwine
Let our bodies be twisted but never our minds

Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?

Set to work idle hands, shake these thoughts had I planned them
They never would be teasing me as viciously as these

Is this love?

That there may be a job in the city

About another sordid hall of dreams
About a man who's king of industry
He would swear by his mouth almighty
He would buy the best
But never something new
And he never told me

Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky
Oh I like kicking in the gutter

Summer in the city where the air is still
A baby being born to the overkill
Well who cares what people say
We walk down love's motorway

Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
And singing hearts and flowers

But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true

A star above the city in the northern chill
A baby being born to the overkill
No say, no place to go
A TV, a radio

Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
And singing hearts and flowers

But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true

Who could heal
What's never been as one
And our hearts have been torn
Since the day we were born
Just like anyone

From Westwood to Hollywood
The one thing that's understood
Is that you can't buy time
But you can sell your soul
And the closest thing to heaven is to rock and roll

But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true

There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue

And my heart still aches for you (Oooo)

And not a promise that I didn't make

Well I thought time might help me win this game
But being away from you is slowly driving me insane

580,Letter from America - Band Version,This Is the Story,The Proclaimers,1987,242666,45,"

When you go will you send back
A letter from America?
Take a look up the railtrack
From Miami to Canada

Broke off from my work the other day
I spent the evening thinking about
All the blood that flowed away
Across the ocean to the second chance
I wonder how it got on when it reached the promised land?

When you go will you send back
A letter from America?
Take a look up the railtrack
From Miami to Canada

I've looked at the ocean
Tried hard to imagine
The way you felt the day you sailed
From Wester Ross to Nova Scotia
We should have held you
We should have told you
But you know our sense of timing
We always wait too long

When you go will you send back
A letter from America?
Take a look up the railtrack
From Miami to Canada

Lochaber no more
Sutherland no more
Lewis no more
Skye no more
(3x)

I wonder my blood
Will you ever return
To help us kick the life back
To a dying mutual friend
Do we not love her?
I think we all claim we love her
Do we have to roam the world
To prove how much it hurts?

When you go will you send back
A letter from America?
Take a look up the railtrack
From Miami to Canada

Bathgate no more
Linwood no more
Methil no more
Irvine no more
(3x)

Bathgate no more
Linwood no more
Methil no more
Lochaber no more

581,Something So Strong,Crowded House (Deluxe),Crowded House,1986-08-01,174026,45,"

Love can make you weep
Can make you run for cover
Roots that spread so deep
Bring life to frozen ground

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

Turning in my sleep
Love can leave you cold
A taste of jealousy
Is like a lust for gold

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

I've been
Feeling so much older
Frame me
And hang me on the wall
I've seen
You fall into the same trap
This thing
Is happening to us all

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

Something so strong
Something so strong
Something so strong
Something, something so strong

[Verse 1:]
The flowers you gave me are just about to die
When I think about
What could've been
Makes me want to cry

The sweet words you whispered didn't mean a thing
I guess our song is over
As we began to sing

[Chorus:]
Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
Could've been my lover
Every day day of my life

Could've been so beautiful
Could've been so right
I'll never hold
What could've been on a cold and lonely night

[Verse 2:]
The memories of our loving still linger in the air
Like the faded scent of your roses
Stay with me everywhere

Everytime I get my hopes up
They always seem to fall
Still what could've been
Is better than what can never be at all
At all

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

How can you hold what could've been
On a cold and lonely night

As I sit in this smoky room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend
Rememberin' when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat, baby

Remember how we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever

Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

Remember days of skippin' school
Racin' cars and bein' cool
With a six-pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go
Remember at the prom that night
You and me, we had a fight
But the band, they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong

We danced so close, we danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together forever

Time, time, time
See what's become of me

Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please
Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside
It's bound to be a better ride than what you've got planned
Carry a cup in your hand
Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hang onto your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say, but if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again
Look around
Grass is high
Fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me?

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around

Welcome to the big time, you're bound to be a star
Even if you don't go all the way, I know that you'll go far
This race is for rats, it can turn you upside down
Ain't no one you can count on in this sleazy little town, oh no

Lots of promises in the dark
Don't you open your heart

'Cause it don't mean nothing
The words that they say
No, it don't mean nothing
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothing
No victim, no crime
No, it don't mean nothing
Till you sign it on the dotted line
Whoa yeah

The director smiles as you walk in the door
He says, ""I love your work, babe, but you're just not what we're looking for""
It's never what, but who it is you know
So easy to get stuck in all that California snow, oh no

Take a good look around and you'll find
People trying to mess with your mind

But it don't mean nothing
The words that they say
No, it don't mean nothing
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothing
No victim, no crime
No, it don't mean nothing
Till you sign it on the dotted line

Hollywood can be so lonely
Make you the winner of a losing fight
Party is never over
The stars are always shining, doesn't matter if it's day or night

The producer says, ""let me change a line or two""
And a little bit of something can look awfully good to you
And you wanna scream, but you gotta keep it all inside
When you're trying to make a living, there ain't no such thing as pride, oh no

Lots of promises in the dark
Don't you open your heart

'Cause it don't mean nothing
The words that they say
No, it don't mean nothing
These games that people play
No, it don't mean nothing
No victim, no crime
No, it don't mean nothing

Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding

[Chorus]
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...

[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school, and that's what I did

[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

See me walking down Fifth Avenue
A walking cane here at my side
I take it everywhere I walk

Modesty, propriety, can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
At night a candle's brighter than the sun

[Saxophone solo followed by drums]

Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run

[Verse 3]
If ""manners maketh man"" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Be yourself, no matter what they say

598,Love Changes (Everything),Everything,Climie Fisher,1988-03-14,268186,64,"

I was only seventeen when she looked at me that way
Seems like yesterday
I was only fooling round but she stole my heart away
I've never been the same

I felt the strangest feeling
Like a raging fire it burned
She left, I cried for weeks
And I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings, oho

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

Then the years went rolling by, I grew up and moved away
Had to earn my pay
Found another lover then but my heart is sad to say
It only ended up the same way

And I wondered: was I destined to spend my life alone?
Oh, girl, you answered my question
This time it's working, you've given me new hope

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

I've seen the way love shakes you, makes you, breaks you
It's got a power of its own

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings
Don't forget it, girl

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Don't you forget it, baby
Love changes everything

(Love makes you fly) Flying away, oho
(Love changes) Let's make love
(Love changes everything) Oh

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings
Don't forget it, girl (Love changes)
Don't you forget it, baby
Love changes everything

Blinded, you lost your way
In the side streets and the alleyways

Filling up the city with broad daylight

Angel in devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an angel
Yeah, yeah

I love your precious heart

[Chorus]
I... I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

[Verse 2]
We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

[Chorus]
I... I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever tear us apart

I... I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart

You... You were standing
I was there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

I... I was standing
You were there

610,Where Do Broken Hearts Go,Whitney,Whitney Houston,1987-06-02,277600,64,"

[Verse 1]
I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see
I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only thing
I learned
Is that I need you desperately

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I am
And can you please tell me

[Chorus]
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me
Ooh baby

[Verse 2]
I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I am
And can you please tell me

[Chorus]
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

[Bridge]
And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know

[Chorus]
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

611,Pink Cadillac,Everlasting,Natalie Cole,1987-06-14,268666,38,"

You may think I'm fooling
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do

Well baby you know you bug me
There ain't no secret about that
Well, come on over here and hug me
Baby I'll spill the facts

Well, honey it ain't your money
'Cause I got plenty of that

I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do
There in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Well, now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting you
Into doing something they know is wrong

Well, they tempt you, ma'am, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures
That flesh does surely hold

They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
Man, I ain't going for that

I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you're doing
In the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Now, now, now, some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say that it's too old
And that it just goes too fast

Oh, but love is bigger than a Honda (Honda)
And it's bigger than a Subaru (that too)
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do

Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey, we can park it out in back
And have a party in your pink Cadillac

Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there
In the back of your pink Cadillac
You know the one I mean, Le Car
Woah! Cadillac

Somewhere deep inside
Something's got a hold on you
And it's pushing me aside
See it stretch on forever

And I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

Stripping back the coats
Of lies and deceiption
Back to nothingness
Like a week in the desert

And I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

So don't say no, don't say nothing's wrong
Cos when you get back home maybe I'll be gone

When the nights go down
When you've had your fill
When there's nothing left

It would cause me pain
If we were to end it
But I could start again
You can depend on it

I know I'm right
For the first time in my life
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon
That's why I tell you
You'd better be home soon

Cocktails and moonlit nights

Someone I know is staring at me, and when I look into her eyes

Because you came and turned my life around

All fired up, now I believe there comes a time
When everything just falls in line

In my imagination
There is no complication
I dream about you all the time
In my mind, a celebration
The sweetest of sensation
Thinking you could be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
In my imagination
There is no hesitation
We walk together hand in hand
I'm dreaming
You fell in love with me
Like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do
If only they'd come true

I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love
I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love

It's a crazy situation
You always keep me waiting
Because it's only make believe
And I would come a-running
To give you all my loving
If one day, you would notice me

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is close to breaking
And I can't go on faking
The fantasy that you'll be mine
I'm dreaming
That you're in love with me
Like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do
If only they'd come true

Going loco down in Acapulco
If you stay too long
Yes, you'll be going loco down in Acapulco
The magic down there is so strong

Love is gaining on you, you're just about to fall
If you're afraid to love, afraid to take a chance
You better hide your feelings, get out while you can

With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere
Your search for paradise will come to an end
When you realize what a fool you've been

Memories of loving her, holding her tight every night

Don't go! Don't go!

And I really get the feeling that she likes me

When she's with me she only wants to dance

She wants to dance with me

She wants to dance with me
'Cos I'll let her be what she wants to be

Now I know I've been out of touch
And I never meant to hurt my baby oh so much
'Cos I love her and I think she love me
And that's the way it's got to be

When we're together we never fight
We've got better things to do tonight

Well I lived on the outskirts of town
In an eight room farmhouse, baby
When my brothers and friends were around
There was always somethin' doin'
Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends
Stopped by to see me every once in a while
When I think back about those days
All I can do is sit and smile

That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything

Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby
Outside the club""Cherry Bomb""
Our hearts were really thumpin'
Say yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah yeah yeah

The winter days they last forever
But the weekends went by so quick
Went ridin' around this little country town
We were goin' nuts, girl, out in the sticks
One night, me with my big mouth
A couple guys had to put me in my place
When I see those guys these days
We just laugh and say do you remember when

If we've done any wrong
I hope that we're forgiven
Got a few kids of my own
And some days I still don't know what to do
I hope that they're not laughing too loud
When they hear me talkin'
Like this to you

Summer came and left without a warning
All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before

Now I'm back to what I knew before you
Somehow the city doesn't look the same
I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh

Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine
Oh, oh

There's only so much I can say
So please don't run away from what we have together
It's only you and me tonight
So let's stay lost in flight
Oh, won't you please surrender

Lover, I'm off the streets
I'm gonna go where the bright lights
And the big city meet
With a red guitar, on fire

Yeah, I'm like the needle
The needle and spoon
Over the counter, with a shotgun
Pretty soon, everybody's got one
I'm in a fever, when I'm beside her
Desire
Desire

And the fever, gettin' higher
Desire
Desire
(Burning, burning)

She's the dollars
She's my protection
Yeah, she's the promise
In the year of election
Sister I can't let you go
Like a preacher stealin' hearts at a travellin' show
For love or money, money, money... ?
And the fever, gettin' higher

You keep on asking me
""Why can't we be together?""
I keep saying ""Won't you wait a while?""
What's all the hurry?
I thought we had forever
I just need time 'til I can make up my mind
I'm not asking for a love to last forever
I don't expect to get a guarantee
It's just that I believe
Lovers should stick together
I'm only saying, won't you wait for me?

I've got to be, got to be certain
I've got to be so sure
I've had my share of hearts broken

Boys are all the same
They're only looking out for just one thing
I'm only hoping that
You won't turn out like that
I need some time 'til I can make up my mind
Been hurt in love before
But I still come back for more
Was such a fool, I couldn't stop myself
If you believe in me
If you want our love to be
I know you'll wait for me, oh

I know you've heard so many people say
I've got a different girl in every town
But there must be somebody telling lies
And spreading rumours, spreading rumours all around

Because my only joy, is a cuddly toy
Waiting for me when I get home
And what I need is a girl like you
To call my very own

So you've got to feel for me baby
So you've got to feel for me baby
So you've got to feel for me baby
And give me some love

Well I don't pour out my heart like this, to everyone
And anyone that I meet
And I know it ain't the wine 'cause I feel just fine
Can't you see baby, I'm still on my feet

A cuddly toy is my only joy
Waiting for me when I get home
And what I need is a girl like you
To call my very own

I've been missing you

I've got the roses and I've got the wine
With a little luck she will be here on time
This is the place we used to go
With romantic music and the lights down low
And as you stand there amazed at the door
And you're wondering what all this is for
It's just a simple thing from me to you
The lady that I adore
Cause there's something that you should know

It's that I've been missing you
More than words can say
And that I've been thinking about it every day
And the time we had just dancing nice and slow
And I said ""Now that I've found you
I'm never letting go""

There is no reason to the things that we do
You can break a heart with just a word or two
And take a lifetime to apologise
When the one you love's in front of your eyes
And I will fall to my knees like a fool
If it's the only way of getting through
You see if I think you are beautiful
Someone else is gonna feel it too
So there's only on thing to do

It's that I've been missing you
More than words can say
And that I've been thinking about it everyday
Well tonight's our night for dancing nice and slow
Because now I've found you
I'm never letting... go

I gave you all the love I had in me
Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true

Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street
(I see you across the street)
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels
When you realize that you're not the only one

Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop

Time after time I've tried to walk away
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two
So I just resign myself to it every day
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you

Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart
Ooh you'd better stop
If you love me
(You will remember)
Now's the time to be sorry
(That day forever)
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me

Oh you'd better stop
Before you tear me all apart
You'd better stop
Before you go and break my heart

Ooh you'd better stop
Baby stop
Ooh you'd better stop
Ooh stop
Baby stop
Baby stop
You'd better stop
Stop, stop stop

Wish on a four leaf clover

Just left me beside myself without your heart

Drying in the color of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away

That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are

Like tears from a star like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are how fragile we are

Like tears from a star like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are how fragile we are
How fragile we are how fragile we are

Never ending love is what we've found
And you complete the heart of me
Our love is all we need

Circle in the sand (circle in the sand)

I'm in love with you girl cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you crack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true
You’re soft, silky hand long, sweet and thin
That candlelight complexion upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together we're one separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
Cause you contain a quality that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world so try to understand

Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee, Twist
Aah, we're back

Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Take me by my little hand and go like this

The party was packed, I'm talkin' back to back
There was a rapper that was rappin' to a beat that was wack
They was going through the motions out on the dance floor
An' when the rapper was done they wasn't yellin' encore
The people were tired of the same old groove
They wanted something def, something new and improved
Something easy to do but hard to resist
I got something for y'all, what do you call it? The Twist!

Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chubby Checker and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take us by our little hands and go like this

We, we, we broke into the booth and the record stacks
Came up with The Twist and we were scratchin' the track
People started jammin' hard to the funky sound
Did The Twist down and up, then up and down
Then I heard somebody yell: ""Yo Chubby's here""
The people took a little pause just to stop and stare
He said: ""I'll show you people how to Twist with style
'Cause I've been doin' The Twist for a long long while""

Oh you should see Prince Markie Dee
Check out that Kool Rock is rockin' like me
Here comes B-Beat Box, come on, do it Buffy

Com' com' com' come on baby
Com' com' com' com' come on baby
Ooh ooh do do do The Twist
Ooh ooh do do do The Twist

Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chub and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take the world by the hand and do The Twist

Chubby took my sister down to the dance floor
Did The Twist so def, the crowd yelled for more
So I pulled it with my mussle, did my flow with my coil
And when Buff did the Limbo we was rockin' the world

Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chubby Checker and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take the world by the hand and go like this

Hey hey, England, do The Twist, Twist
And France, do The Twist, Twist
Ha ha ha, Holland, do The Twist, Twist

Feels so good we're crying

Spread these wings, we'll be flying

Let me hold you

Now we turn into music
Now we will never lose it
When the rhythm and night ride
No heart can hide

There are times that never ever come again
Memories there for the making
When the night calls, we better let it in

Talk about the love you're missing
Maybe then it's true
When they say love is blind
I can help you if you listen
I can make you feel good
If you just let my try

If everlasting love is
What you're waiting for
Then that time for you
Just has arrived

So here I am, come walk
Right through my door
And be loved for
The rest of your life

If you talk about good loving
Let's talk about the lover in me
So don't go talk about no other
Just talk about the lover in me

I can give you all the loving
But I gotta know that
You're there to receive
I can be your only woman
But I gotta feel that
I'm all that you need

I'll be your everything
And I can give you so much more
And I'll never leave you
Lonely at night

So here I am, come walk
Right through my door
And be loved for
The rest of your life

If you talk about good loving
Let's talk about the lover in me

Let's talk about the lover in me
So don't go talk about no other
Just talk about the lover in me

Talk about and dream about
And think about your lover
Don't talk about or dream about
Or think about no other

Don't run around all over town
Searching for some other
The love we found won't let us down
Let's talk about the lover

I'll be your everything
And I can give you so much more
And I'll never leave you
Lonely at night

So here I am, come walk
Right through my door
And be loved for

Midnight, gettin' uptight, where are you?

But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do

Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down

Don't worry, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Now there is the song I wrote

When you worry you make it double
But don't worry, be happy, be happy now

Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Don't worry, it will soon pass whatever it is)
Don't worry, be happy

She stepped off the bus out into the city streets
Just a small town girl with her whole life
Packed in a suitcase by her feet

But somehow the lights didn't
Shine as bright as they did
On her mama's TV screen

And the work seemed harder
And the days seemed longer
Than she ever thought they'd be

But you know you got to stick to your guns
When it all comes down
Cause sometimes you can't choose
It's like heads they win
Tails you're gonna lose

[Chorus]
Win big--Mama's fallen angel
Lose big--living out her lies
Wants it all--Mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life

Now she found herself in the fast lane living day to day
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
And let her family slip away

Just like a lost soul
Caught up in the Hollywood scene
All the parties and the limousines

Such a good actress hiding all her pain
Trading her memories for fortune and fame

Just a step away from the edge of a fall
Caught between heaven and hell
Where's the girl I knew a year ago

[Chorus]

Too much too soon
Or just a little too late
Cause when her ship came in
She wasn't there and it just wouldn't wait

I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire
You come to me, come to me, wild and wild

Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong, baby

You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart? No, no!
Baby, I would rather be dead

In your heart I see the start of every night and every day
In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place

If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay

I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes

I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby

Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time

My world was shattered, I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
When you walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything, darlin', then and there

Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong

Once but never again

Of always having you here by my side

You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

You're givin' it

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

[Verse 2]
So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

[Chorus]
Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

[Verse 2]
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

[Chorus 2]
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

[Bridge]
Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

[Outro]
Fly, fly, so high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you
Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings

Oceans apart, day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever?

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me going crazy

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance

Oh, can't you see it, baby
You've got me going crazy

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
Waiting for you

693,New York Minute,The End Of The Innocence,Don Henley,1989-06-27,394733,55,"

[Verse 1]
Harry got up, dressed all in black
Went down to the station, and he never came back
They found his clothing scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning

[Verse 2]
He had a home, love of a girl
But men get lost sometimes as years unfurl
One day, he crossed some line, and he was too much in this world
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore

[Chorus]
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, things can get pretty strange
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute

[Verse 3]
Lying here in the darkness, I hear the sirens wail
Somebody going to emergency, somebody's going to jail
You find somebody to love in this world, you better hang on tooth and nail
The wolf is always at the door

[Chorus]
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, things can get a little strange
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute

[Bridge]
And in these days, darkness falls early
And people rush home to the ones they love
You'd better take a fool's advice and take care of your own
One day they're here, next day they're gone

[Verse 4]
Pulled my coat around my shoulders, took a walk down through the park
Leaves were falling around me, groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock, a desperate lover left his mark
""Baby, I've changed, please come back""

[Verse 5]
What the head makes cloudy, the heart makes very clear
I know the days were so much brighter in the time when she was here
I know that somebody somewhere can make these dark clouds disappear
But until that day, I have to believe, I believe, I believe

[Outro]
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, you can get out of the rain
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York, New York minute
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, you can get out of the rain
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, everything can change
In a New York minute, you can get out of the rain
In a New York minute, everything can change

Sometimes I wonder
How I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue

'Cause sometimes it seems
Like this world is closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me

Sometimes I want to give up, wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you, baby
And everything's alright
Everything's alright

When I see you smile, I can face the world
Oh, you know I can do anything
When I see you smile, see a ray of light
Oh, see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby, when I see you smile at me, oh yeah

Baby, there's nothing
In this world that could ever do
What the touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew, hey

And when the rain is falling I don't feel it
'Cause you're here with me now
I want your answer baby

I said I can't let you go
It's not just emotional feeling
I need you body and soul

You give me one good reason to leave me
I'll give you ten good reasons to stay

Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many dreams can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you

The world is full of lonely people
Who never held onto love
Last night I tried to reach you
But somehow it wasn't enough

So I said, can't you wait a bit longer
I'll give you all that a lover should give
It ain't my pride but my love that is stronger
I'd be hurt; I'd be hurt, if you walk away

I hear a wind
Whistling air
Whispering in my ear

Boy mercury shooting through every degree
Oh girl dancing down those dirty and dusty trails
Take it hip to hip rocking through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Skip the air-strip to the sunset
Yeah ride the arrow to the target
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Fly the great big sky see the great big sea
Kick through continents bustin' boundaries
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness

[Verse 1]
I could hardly believe it, when I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see it's true

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

[Chorus]
Tell me, how am I supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

[Verse 2]
I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh
Even now it's more than I can take

[Chorus]
Tell me, how am I supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Now I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
Oh, now that your dream has come true

[Chorus]
Tell me, how am I supposed to live without you?
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on?
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise

Isn't this what's called romance?

'Cause when I'm lost
I can let go

What I'm heading for
You can take me to the skies

I just fell
Don't know why
Something's there we can't deny
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you

And if I can't find my way
If salvation is worlds away
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes

I don't mind not knowing
What I'm heading for

Got to make you turn around

I lie awake at night
Wait for the sun to shine

Your lips on mine
Without a warning
You made our love a lie
You said you were sorry
But you never told me why

Angelia
Where you running to now

Got to make you turn around

Maybe my love is in vain
Maybe you're the hurting kind
Can't take no more of this pain

Tried to be what you wanted
I gave you all I had
You left me with nothin'
Nothin' but a photograph

[Verse 1]
I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone

[Bridge]
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me
And you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew
I'm learning again

[Chorus 1]
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me anymore

[Verse 2]
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive
In such a graceless age?

[Bridge]
The trust and self-assurance
That lead to happiness
They're the very things
We kill, I guess
Oh, pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesn't keep me warm

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out
I have to learn again

[Chorus 2]
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me anymore

[Bridge]
There are people in your life
Who've come and gone
They let you down
You know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you, baby
Cause life goes on
You keep carrying that anger
It'll eat you up inside, baby

[Chorus 1]
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me

[Chorus 3]
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinking about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me

[Outro]
Forgiveness
(Yeah)
Forgiveness
(Baby)
Forgiveness
(Oh, oh)
Forgiveness
(Ah, yeah)
Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
Even if
You don't love me anymore
Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
(Ohh)
Forgiveness
Forgiveness

Nothing could make me change my point of view
Oh girl, I'm gonna miss you, baby

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here wastin' my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you

Like a honey bee, you took the best of me
Now I can't erase those memories
Like a fairy tale, you were so unreal
You left a scar that's so hard to heal

When you had a taste of paradise
Back on Earth can feel as cold as ice
I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna miss you
I miss you

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here wastin' my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you

It's a tragedy for me to see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl, I'm gonna miss you

719,How Can I Fall ?,All That Jazz,Breathe,1988-01-01,284360,49,"

[Verse 1:]
Give me time to care
The moment's here for us to share
Still my heart
Is not always there
What more can I say to you?

Could I lie to you?
I'm just too weak to face the truth
Now I know
I should make a move
What more can I say?

[Chorus:]
How can I fall?
How can I fall?
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't
Give me reasons at all

[Verse 2:]
When all faith is gone
I fight myself to carry on
Yet, I know of the harm I do
What more can I say to you?

Now I hold this line
I know the choice to leave is mine
I can't help
What I feel inside
What more can I say?

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I'll follow through
I'll see I do
When the time is far more
Right for you

I'll make that move
And when I do
Will I doubt again the way I do?

[Repeat Chorus:]
How can I fall?
How can I fall?
(How can I fall?)
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons at all

[Repeat x2:]
How can I fall?
How can I fall?
(How can I fall?)
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons

Just won't give me reasons
Just won't give me reasons at all
How can I fall?
I fall, I fall
How can I fall for you?

How can I fall?
How can I fall?
(How can I fall?)
When you just won't give me reasons
When you just won't give me reasons

720,When Love Comes To Town,Rattle And Hum,U2,1988-10-10,254266,53,"

I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
I was under the waves before love rescued me
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

I ran into a juke-joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazed and in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

(Lost lyrical stanza)
When I woke up I was sleeping on the street
I felt the world was dancing, and I was dirt beneath their feet
When I woke up I saw the Devil looking down
But my Lord He played guitar the day love came to town

[Verse 1]
I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'm prayin' to God you'll give me one more chance, girl

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you

Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty

But I wanted to be your valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine

I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you

To stay alive
There must be more to living
Than nine to five

Why should we wait for some better time?
There may not even be a tomorrow
Ain't no sense in losing your mind
I'm gonna make it worth the ride

Don't you know
I won't give up until I'm satisfied?
Don't you know
Why should I stop until I'm satisfied?

Ignore the hesitation
That ties your hands
Use your imagination
And take a chance

Won't let my moment of truth pass me by
I've gotta make my move, now or never
And if they turn me loose on this town
They're gonna have to hold me down

Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time

Or eighteen karat gold

Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

[Verse 3]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

Express yourself
(You've got to make him) So you can respect yourself
Hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself

Something's gotten hold of my heart
Keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something's gotten into my life
Cutting it's way through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up, and turning me down
Making me smile, and making me frown

In a world that was war
I once lived in a time that was peace and no troubles at all
But then you came my way
And a feeling of unknown shook my heart
Made me want you to stay
All of my nights, and all of my days

(yeah I gotta tell you now)
Something's gotten hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
Yeah, something has invaded my night
Painting my sleep with a colour so bright
Changing the grey, and changing the blue
Scarlet for me, and scarlet for you

I got to know if this is the real thing
I got to know it's making my heart sing
Wo-hoo-o-ye-e-e-e-e e-
You smile and I am lost for a lifetime
Each minute spent with you is the right time
Every hour, every day
You touch me and my mind goes astray, yeah
Baby, baby

Something's gotten hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
Something has invaded my night
Painting my sleep with a colour so bright
Changing the grey, and changing the blue
Scarlet for me, and scarlet for you

Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through

I paint a picture of the days gone by
When love went blind and you would make me see
I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes
So that I knew you were there for me
Time after time you were there for me

Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sands - I remember you
Through the sleepless nights, through every endless day
I'd wanna hear you say - I remember you
Oh, whoa

We spent the summer with the top rolled down
And wished ever after would be like this
You said ""I love you babe,"" without a sound
I said I'd give my life for just one kiss
I'd live for your smile and die for your kiss

Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sands - I remember you
And through the sleepless nights, through every endless day

And through it all we kept the promise that we made

Washed away a dream of you
But nothing else could ever take you away
'Cause you'll always be my dream come true

Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand
Love letters in the sands - I remember you

Early in the morning, I put breakfast at your table
And make sure that your coffee has its sugar and cream
Your eggs are over-easy, your toast done lightly
All that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me
Now you say the juice is sour, it used to be so sweet
And I can't help but to wonder if you're talking 'bout me
We don't talk the way we used to talk, it’s hurting so deep
I’ve got my pride, I will not cry
But it’s making me weak

I'm not your superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me

(Ooh baby. Ay, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you
I want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you
But when you get there you just tell me you’re not hungry at all
You said you'd rather read the paper and you don't want to talk
You like to think that I’m just crazy when I say that you've changed
I’m convinced I know the problem: you don't love me the same
You’re just going through the motions and you’re not being fair
I've got my pride, I will not cry
Still I can't help but care

Ooh baby
Look into the corners of your mind
I'll always be there for you through good and bad times
But I can't be that superwoman that you want me to be
I'll give my love, everlasting love if you'll return love to me
I’m not your superwoman

I'm not your superwoman, oh no, oh no
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human (I'm only human)
This girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me

Ah, ha, if you feel it in your heart and you understand me
Stop right where you are, everybody sing along with me
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo…hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
I’m the kind of girl that can treat you so sweet
But you got to realize that you got to be sweeter to me
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo…hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
I need love
I need just your love
I'm not your superwoman

It must have broke your poor little heart
When the boys used to say
You looked better in the dark
But now they'd give all they learnt in school
To be somewhere in the dark with you

The teacher would ask the questions
And you, would always raise your hand
But somehow you never got your turn
And my eyes would fill with water, inside I'd burn

[Chorus]
Homely girl, you used to be so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh homely girl
Homely girl you used to be so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh homely girl

There was a boy who used to sit beside you
Who'd like to hold that place his whole life through
Oooh you were beautiful to me
You had a heart no one could ever see, oh yes you did

Homely girl, you used to be so lonely
You're a beautiful woman oh homely girl

I was the only one who offered
To carry your books
Took all the stares and laughter
And the dirty looks
Cause I saw then what they see now
They all want to ask you for a date
They don't know how, they don't know how

Well the times are getting hard for you, little girl
I'm a humming and a strumming all over god's world
You can't remember when you got your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line

Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
And the heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're looking tired, you're looking kind of beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

You didn't know how rock and roll looked
Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
Half way home in the parking lot
By the look in her eye she was giving what she got

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

Woman you're a mess going to die in your sleep
There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messing around
My best friend told me you're the best lick in town

You didn't know that rock and roll burned
So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm you got the speed
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

Until i saw your picture on another guy's jacket
You told me I was the only one
But look at you now, it's dark and you're gone

My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby
My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, baby

Can't find the joy
You know that I'd be with you now
If I had the choice

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know I hurt you when I said goodbye
And I don't know the reason
I ever stopped believing
I never needed anyone but you, oh

[Chorus]
I was too blind to see
When you belonged to me
You were my everything
Now I'd give anything
To feel the love you bring
You were my everything

[Verse 2]
They say time can mend a broken heart
And fix you up
But my life could never ever be the same
Without your touch

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know you're still afraid to let me in
And I don't blame you really
I wouldn't let you see me
I took for granted you would always be there

[Chorus]
I was too blind to see
When you belonged to me
You were my everything
Now I'd give anything
To feel the love you bring
You were my everything

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know I hurt you when I said goodbye
And I don't know the reason
I ever stopped believing
I never needed anyone but you, oh

[Chorus]
I was too blind to see
When you belonged to me
You were my everything
Now I'd give anything
To feel the love you bring
You were my everything

You were my life
You were my love
You were my everything

You were my life
Yeah
You were my everything

Oh woah
Yeah
You were my everything

[Verse 1]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on!
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build a
Relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say: ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
Jus' bust this

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
So please, listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...
