[Intro]
Never know
Cannot know
Never know
Cannot know
Never know
Cannot know
Never know

[Verse 1]
Under a lovers' sky
Gonna be with you
And no one's gonna be around
If you think that you won't fall
Well, just wait until
Til the sun goes down

[Pre-Chorus]
Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling so right
It will steal your heart tonight

[Chorus]
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart

[Verse 2]
There's no escaping love
Once a gentle breeze
Weaves it's spell upon your heart
No matter what you think
It won't be too long
'Til you're in my arms

[Pre-Chorus]
Underneath the starlight, starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight

[Chorus]
You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know
That you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
No matter what you do
The light is gonna get to you

[Bridge]
Never know
Cannot know
Never know
Cannot know
Never know
Cannot know

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try, you're never gonna win, oh
Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling, so right
It'll steal your heart tonight

[Chorus]
You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
No
You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart (surrender your heart)
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it

[Outro]
You can try to resist, try to hide from my kiss
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart
But you know, but you know that you
Can't fight the moonlight
No

[Intro]
Mmm, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Ooh, baby, baby

You see, my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?

That is just so typically me
Oh, baby, oh

""But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end.""
""Well, baby, I went down and got it for ya.""
""Aw, you shouldn't have!""

Oops, I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh, baby
Oops, you (Oops, you) think that I'm sent from above

Talk to me
Tell me your name
You blow me off like it's all the same
You lit a fuse and now I'm ticking away
Like a bomb
Yeah, baby

Talk to me
Tell me your sign
You're switching sides like a Gemini
You're playing games and now you're hittin' my
Heart
Like a drum
Yeah, baby

Well if lady luck gets on my side
We're gonna rock this town alive
I'll let her rough me up
'Till she knocks me out
She walks like she talks
And she talks like she walks

And she bangs, she bangs
Oh baby
When she moves, she moves
I go crazy
'Cause she looks like a flower but she stings
Like a bee
Like every girl in history
She bangs, she bangs

I'm wasted by the way she moves
No one ever looked so fine
She reminds me that a woman only got one thing on her mind

Talk to me
Tell me your name
I'm just a link in your daisy chain
Your rap sounds like a diamond
Map to the stars
Yeah, Baby

Talk to me
Tell me the news
You wear me out like a pair of shoes
We'll dance until the band goes home
Then you're gone
Yeah, Baby

Well if it looks like love should be a crime
You'd better lock me up for life
I'll do the time with a smile on my face
Thinking of her in her leather and lace

Well if Lady Luck gets on my side
We're gonna rock this town alive
I'll let her rough me up
'Till she knocks me out
She walks like she talks
And she talks like she walks

There was a time
When nothing would last
There was a time
I held on to the past

I would walk on water just to be with you
Walk on water just to be with you
Split the ocean
Cross the sea
Walk on water if you believe

There was a time i lost my faith
There was a time i could only hate
You are my shepheard
You are my guide
I followd your dark eyes right into the night
You are my savior
You took contoll
You came and touched my soul

I would walk on water just to be with you
Walk on water just to be with you
Split the ocean
Corss the sea
Walk on water if you beleive

There was a time
When nothing would last
There was a time
I held on to the past
You are my shepheard
You are my guide
I followd your dark eyes right into the night
You are my savior
You took contoll
You came and touched my soul

But why are you still over-shadowd by a doubt?
If only you could see
The love that carries me

I would walk on water just to be with you
Walk on water just to be with you
Split the ocean
Corss the sea
Walk on water if you believe

I would walk on water just to be with you
Walk on water just to be with you
Split the ocean
Corss the sea
Walk on water if you believe

Whew, it sure is hot out here, you know
I don't mind, though

[Verse 1: Erica Campbell]
In the corners of my mind

I understand
That I should praise You through my circumstance

Everything that could go wrong
All went wrong at one time
So much pressure fell on me
I thought I was gon' lose my mind
Lord, I know You wanna see
If I will hold on through these trials
But I need You to lift this load
'Cause I can't take it no more

Been through the fire and the rain
Bound in every kind of way
But God has broken every chain
So let me go right now

I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You

[Intro]
I've been around the world - hey, hey
I've been around the world - hey, hey
In the kitchen where I'm cooking what is good for me
Spices from the globe
Little by little it's the finest meal
It's appetite for hope - come and see

Ingredients from the Seven Seas and
I'm realizing things ain't what they seem
That's the riddle of it
That's the spirit of it
That's the power of life

I've been around the world (Round the world)
And I've seen it all (Seen it all)
I've been around the world (Round the world)

I've been around the world (Round the world)
And I want you to see (Seen it all)
I've been the only girl (Round the world)
All surrounded by mystery

[Verse 2]
In the living room I'm cleaning up from top to floor
The place I love the most
The wall is covered up with all my souvenirs
I've got from coast to coast - come and see
You mix it all together in your dreams
Ingredients from the Seven Seas and
I'm realizing things ain't what they seem
That's the riddle of it
That's the spirit of it
That's the power of life

I've been around the world (Round the world)
And I've seen it all (Seen it all)
I've been around the world (Round the world)

I'm still coming around
I keep chasing dreams
Girl, I keep coming around - hey, hey
I keep coming around
And I can never stop
Girl, I keep coming around
Cause if I do I'll walk
Around around - hmm, around the world

[Chorus]
I've been around the world (Round the world)
Hey, hey (Seen it all)

Make some noise for the Vengaboys!

[Verse 1]
There's a boy in my mind and he knows I'm thinkin' of him
All my way to the day and the night the stars shine above me
He's been gone for some time but I know I truly love him
And I'm singing a song, hoping he'll be back when he hears it

[Chorus]
My heart goes shalala lala, shalala in the morning
Shalala lala, shalala in the sunshine
Shalala lala, shalala in the evening
Shalala lala shalala lala just for you

[Verse 2]
If your love's gone away just like mine you feel like crying
Sing along maybe once maybe twice, let's try it together
Some sweet day no one knows he'll return and you'll be happy
Shout it sweet in a song, listen to your heart it is singin'

[Chorus]
My heart goes shalala lala, shalala in the morning
Shalala lala, shalala in the sunshine
Shalala lala, shalala in the evening
Shalala lala shalala lala just for you

[Intro]
Spinning around, spinning around
Oh

[Chorus]
I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this

[Verse 1]
Traded in my sorrow for some joy that I borrowed
From back in the day
Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe
I got something to say
I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back
The future will be
And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction
And it leads back to me?

[Chorus]
I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this

[Verse 2]
The mistakes that I've made have given me the strength
To really believe
And no matter how I take it, there's no way I'm gonna fake it
'Cause it's gotta be real
I've got nothing left to hide, no reason left to fight
'Cause the truth's given me
A new freedom inside, getting rid of my desire
Do you like what you see?

[Chorus]
I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
You and me, we have an opportunity
And we could make it something really cool
But you, you think I'm not that kind of girl
I'm here to tell ya' baby, I know how to rock your world

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on

Don't call me baby
You've got some nerve and baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby

Behind my smile is my IQ
I must admit this does not sit with the likes of you
You're really sweet
Mmm, you're really nice
But didn't mama ever tell ya' not to play with fire?

Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on
Don't underestimate me boy

What’s practical? What's logical? What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I’m so happy when you’re dancing there

39,Uptown Girl - Radio Edit,Coast To Coast (Expanded Edition),Westlife,2000,186440,66,"

[Verse 1]
Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a back street guy
I bet her mama never told her why
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

[Chorus]
And when she knows what
She wants from her time
And when she wakes up
And makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love with an uptown girl

[Verse 2]
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high-class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice
Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win

[Chorus]
And when she's walking
She's looking so fine
And when she's talking
She'll say that she's mine
She'll say I'm not so tough
Just because
I'm in love
With an uptown girl

[Bridge]
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am

[Chorus]
Uptown girl
She's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl
You know I'm in love
With an uptown girl
My uptown girl

Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw the dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling

Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need

What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you (You) that I really feel (Feel)

There you were freaking out
Trying to get your head around
The fact that you and me and love is dead

Cranking up your altercations, getting upset in your desperation
Screamin' and hollerin'

And let me dance along, until the lights are on

You leave me once again home alone
The fridge is full but my heart is achin'
You think I can make it on my own
Just a kiss and you are gone

Another night like a million before
Another party where I'm not invited
As always you'll heat the dance floor
In front of your turntables going mad

Why don't you keep me close to you
I'm not anymore the kid you knew
Why should I stay deep in the blue
I wanna move my body too

And let the music play, until the break of day

We've been aside since I meant to be
A part of you that was just awaking
My life with you is a fantasy
I am your prince and you are my king

You say your thing drives sometimes you insane
You think you're no good father and so you're ashamed
But all I want is to share your pain
Clubbin' the night along and having fun

Why don't you keep me close to you

I wanna feel this part of you
I wanna move my body too

Exec to my own shit, dawg, I'm ownin' dot-coms

Who's that girl? (C'mon, c'mon)
Eve's that girl (Uh, yo, yo, yo)
Who's that girl? (Huh? Uh, uh)
Eve's that girl (Yo, yo)

[Verse 2]
I can understand why they're scared of Eve
Thought I did it one way, ain't prepared for me, huh
Mad 'cause an image I don't care to be
Realness, real shit, spit reality
Attitude rude, that's the Philly in I
Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life, breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on they wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listenin' to other shit? You got the best here
Come on, try your luck, shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin', vouch for my behavior
Same way they get down, I get down for this paper
Sixteen mean from my pen, so you can test her
Still need to know who I am, then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line, my world, my way, any questions?

[Chorus]
Who's that girl? (Uh, c'mon, c'mon)
Eve's that girl (Uh, yo, yo, yo)
Who's that girl? (Uh, say my name, y'all)
Eve's that girl (Yo)

[Verse 3]
Power moves is made every day by this thorough bitch
I'ma get this bank any way that I do this shit
I was born to shine, and most of y'all's borderline bullshit
Know exactly what I want for me, you cats is clueless, though
'Spose the flow through my hands like water
Keep stocks growin' for my son or my daughter
Eve want her own cash, fuck what you bought her
He spend, you owe, that's what mommy taught her
So hardball is played, won't starve today
Song after song I write, so I get paid
Thought I wasn't followin' up with the second round
Now, bitch, swallow it up while I shove it down
Make 'em love me over again and over your name
Bet you they get over your style and over your fame
Why you lookin' sad at me? I ain't to blame
Back to plan B, baby, I can feel your pain

[Chorus]
Who's that girl? (E-V-E, y'all, uh, uh, now say my name, y'all)
Eve's that girl (C'mon, uh, uh, uh, c'mon, c'mon)
Who's that girl? (Uh, E-V-E, y'all, c'mon, now say my name, y'all)
Eve's that girl (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Who's that girl? (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

All the subtle flavors of my life
Are become bitter seeds
And poisoned leaves
Without you
You represent what's true
I drain the color from the sky
And turn blue
Without you
These arms lack a purpose
Flapping like a humming-bird
I'm nervous 'cause
I'm the left eye
You're the right
Would it not be madness to fight?
We come 1
In you the song which rights my wrongs
In you the fullness of living
The power to begin again
From right now, in you
We come 1
I'm unafraid
Never ever scared
Worries washed
Pressed air
I am the left eye
You're the right
Would it not be madness to fight?

Adieu
Aux arbres mouillés de septempbre
À leur soleil de souvenir
A ces mots doux a ces mots tendres
Que je tai entendu me dire
À la faveur dun chemin creux
Ou dune bougie allumée
Adieu a ce qui fut nous deux
À la passion du verbe aimer
Ladieu
Est une infini diligence
Où les chevaux ont du souffrir
Où les reflets de tont absence
Ont marqué lombre du plaisir
Ladieu est une lettre de toi
Que je garderai sur mon cur
Une illusion de toi et moi

Une impression de vivre ailleurs
Ladieu
Nest que vérité devant dieu
Tout le reste est lettre à écrire
À ceux qui ce son dit adieu
Quand il fallait se retenir
Tu ne peux plus baiser les yeux
Devant le rouges des cheminées
Nous avons connus dautres feux
Qui nous ont si bien consumés
Ladieu
Cest nos deux corps qui se séparent
Sur la rivière du temps qui passe
Je ne sais pas pour qui tu part
Et tu ne sais pas qui membrasse
Nous naurons plus de jalousies
Ni de paroles qui font souffrir
Aussi fort quon sétais choisi
Est fort le moment de partir
Oh ladieu
Ladieu
Cest le sanglot long des horloges
Et des trompettes de waterloo
Dire à tous ceux qui sinterroge
Que lamour est tombée à leau
Dun bateau ivre de tristesse
Qui nous à ronger toi et moi
Les passagers sont en détresse
Et jen conais deux qui se noient
Adieu
Aux arbres mouillés de septempbre
À leur soleil de souvenir
A ces mots doux a ces mots tendres
Que je tai entendu me dire
À la faveur dun chemin creux
Ou dune bougie allumée
Adieu a ce qui fut nous deux
À la passion du verbe aimer
Ladieu
Cest le loup blanc dans sa montagne
Et les chasseurs dans la vallées
Le soleil qui nous accompagne
Est une lune bête a pleurer
Ladieu ressemble a ces marées
Qui viendrons tout ensevelir
Les marins avec les mariées
Le passé avec lavenir

Caped Crusaders falling from off glaciers
Landing under water then shooting micro-lasers
All we do is make the facility melt
Number one villian that's felt
Pull up the utility belt
It went - *boom-blam-zoom-zap*
Crash the canvas with the cobras hissing at the bottom of my straps
Leap buildings, fly flying saucers
Dissolving inside the forrest when the radar lost us
Torpedo glare thru the Vast Aire

Vaporize them costume kit and disguise

And tell Super Boy he's a super toy

It's a bird, it's a plane!
No it's Lois Lane giving me brains
She game to Gotham to write a story
I told her 'Put the pen down, show me the panties'
Peter Parker can't do shit to me
I'm Vast Man with a capital V
But to my avail there was Vicki Vale
Tryna seduce me
Doing the Vast twosie
I told her to slow down
She wanted to sleep like a bat upside down
Well, I can arrange that
And that's when the Riddler started to clown
He was like 'It's my time'

62,Hit 'Em Up Style (Oops!),So Blu,Blu Cantrell,2001-01-18,250706,63,"

[Verse 1]
While he was schemin'
I was beamin' in the Beamer just steamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman Marcus on a shopping spree-ah
And on my way, I grabbed Sole and Mia
And as the cashbox rang, I thought everything away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oops!) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops!) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops!) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops!) There goes the house we've made a home
(Oops!) There goes ""You'll never leave me alone""
(Oops!) For all the lies you told
This is what you're owed

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

[Verse 2]
While he was braggin'
I was coming down the hill just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid, all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fade away, away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oops!) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops!) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops!) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops!) There goes the house we've made a home
(Oops!) There goes ""you'll never leave me alone""
(Oops!) For all the lies you told
This is what you owe

[Chorus]
Hey ladies (Hey ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh (Oh), when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
Hey ladies (Ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild (Oh)
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If you mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

[Bridge]
All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days when we used to trust each other?
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
'Cause revenge is just better than money, you'll see

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style (Hit 'em up style)
Get your hands on his cash and (Oh yeah)
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up (Oh-oh-oh)
Hey ladies (Hey ladies, hey ladies, hey ladies, yeah)
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh no, oh no, yeah, oh oh oh
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up (Hit 'em up, yeah)
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild (Buck wild)
Just go back and hit 'em up style (Oh)
Get your hands on his cash and (Da da dum, da da dum)
Oh, when you go then everything goes (Everything goes)
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up

Suddenly I saw her
Dancing on the scene
Just like in a dream
She would set my heart on fire

I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cause you're so fine

She had such a swing
Anyone could see
Her body meaning things
That look so good to me
Music got my head
Spinning all around
She got me in a trance
Just by the way she danced

No regards, close, but it's no cigar
A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last
I jump in pools and make a big splash
Water overflowin', so get your head right
It's all in your mind, punk, so keep your head tight
Enough with tips and advice and thangs
I'm big dog, havin' women seein' stripes and thangs
They go to sleep, start snorin', countin' sheep and shit
They so wet that they body start to leak and shit
Just 'cause I'm a all-nighter, shoot all fire

[Verse]
Last night I had a dream about you
In this dream, I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
The kind of feeling I've waited so long
Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun
We were dancing all night long
The time is right to put my arms around you
You're feeling right, you wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it, this dream was all gone

[Chorus]
Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true
Ooh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

The day you leave will cry a river

[Intro: Redman & Christina Aguilera]
Ahh, dirty, dirty, filthy, filthy, nasty
Christina, you nasty (Yeah)
Too dirty to clean my act up (Haha)
If you ain't dirty, you ain't here to party (Woo)
Ladies, move, gentleman, move
Somebody ring the alarm, a fire on the roof
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows (Get up, who ready to party out there?)
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows (Where my dawgs at?)
Uh, let me loose

[Verse 1: Christina Aguilera]
Ooh, I'm overdue
Give me some room, I'm comin' through
Paid my dues, in the mood
Me and my girls come to shake the room
DJ spinnin' (Show your hands)
Let's get dirty (That's my jam)
I need that, uh, to get me off (Yeah)
Sweatin' 'til my clothes come off
It's explosive, speakers are thumpin'
Still jumpin', six in the mornin'
Table dancin', glasses are crashin'
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (Can you feel it?), 'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival

[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]
Ah, heat is up
Ladies, fellas, drop your cups
Bodies packed front to back
Move your ass, I like that
Tight hip-huggers (Low for sure)
Shake a little somethin' (On the floor)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweatin' 'til my clothes come off
Let's get open, cause a commotion
Still goin', eight in the mornin'
There's no stoppin', we keep it poppin'
Hard rockin', everyone's talkin'
Give all you got (Give it to me), just hit the spot
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty

Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
Here it comes, it's the one you been waitin' on
Get up, get it rough, yup, that's what's up
Givin' just what you love to the maximum
Uh-oh (Uh-oh), here we go (Here we go)
What to do when the music starts to drop
That's when we take it to the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Uh-oh (Uh-oh), here we go (Here we go)
Woah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Redman & Christina Aguilera]
Yo, hot damn, Doc a jam like a summer show
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents, I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas (Ow)
F the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo, Christina (What?), better hop in here
My block live and in color like Rodman hair (Yeah)
The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a wrap, no bargain deals
I drive a four-wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up, baby, it's Brick City, you heard of that
We blessed, and hung low like Bernie Mac (Bernie Mac?)
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB the way I'm freakin'

Gonna get rowdy (Rowdy)
Gonna get a little unruly (Unruly)
Get it fired up in a hurry (Hurry)

Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh, sweat drippin' over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival
Gonna get rowdy
Bound to get a little unruly

You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

[Verse 1]
Here's how it goes
You and me, up and down
But maybe this time we'll get it right, worth the fight
'Cause love is something you can't shake
When it breaks (When it breaks)
All it takes is some trying

[Chorus]
If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love
You can run, you can hide
But you can't escape my love

[Verse 2]
So, if you go
You should know (You should know)
It's hard to just forget the past so fast
It was good (It was good), it was bad, but it was real
And that's all you have in the end, our love mattered

[Chorus]
If you feel like leaving
I'm not gonna beg you to stay (I won't beg you to stay)
But soon you'll be finding
You can run, you can hide

When you stare at my face
You're messing with my brain
If you try to convince me then you better think again
If you move to the music, the music's got to give
If it's too complicated that's the way I wanna live
If you hate me I will show you
How to break me into something new
If you want me run away now
If you stop me then I'll hit the ground

Checkin' every girl in sight
Groovin' like he does the mambo

On the spot always around twelve
Plays the mix that Diego mezcla con la salsa
Y la baila and he dances y la canta

Take me now, baby, here as I am
Put me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel when I 'm in your hands
Take my hand, come under cover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Jan Wayne's gonna move ya

Have I doubt, when I'm alone
Love is a ring on the telephone
Love is an angel, disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes

Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, and the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now
Can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Because the night belongs to lovers

Way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
You keep lookin' at me
You gettin' scared now, right?
Don't feel me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good, right?
Listen

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I kinda noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song with me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember
Sing a song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
(I won't let you down, baby)
If you give me that chance to be your man
(Here baby, put on my jacket)
And then..

Ma, whatchu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend see, I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall kids ask ""How the chain glow?""
Point to her they say, ""Wow, it's the same glow""
Point to me I say, ""Yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my a-like (Yeah)
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called ""Brain"" (I just love your... brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake - now how heavy is that?

Break it down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums (hey!)

Destined to do what they do

[Verse 1]
Nager dans les eaux troubles
Des lendemains
Attendre ici la fin
Flotter dans l'air trop lourd
Du presque rien
A qui tendre la main
Si je dois tomber de haut
Que ma chute soit lente
Je n'ai trouvé de repos
Que dans l'indifférence
Pourtant, je voudrais retrouver l'innocence
Mais rien n'a de sens, et rien ne va

[Chorus]
Tout est chaos
A côté
Tous mes idéaux des mots
Abimé
Je cherche une âme, qui
Pourra m'aider
Je suis
D'une génération désenchantée
Désenchantée

[Verse 2]
Qui pourrait m'empêcher
De tout entendre
Quand la raison s'effondre
A quel saint se vouer
Qui peut prétendre
Nous bercer dans son ventre

[Verse 3]
Si la mort est un mystère
La vie n'a rien de tendre
Si le ciel a un enfer
Le ciel peut bien m'attendre
Dis moi
Dans ces vents contraires comment s'y prendre
Plus rien n'a de sens, plus rien ne va

[Chorus]
Tout est chaos
A côté
Tous mes idéaux des mots
Abimé
Je cherche une âme, qui
Pourra m'aider
Je suis
D'une génération désenchantée

Tout est chaos

Abimé
Je cherche une âme, qui
Pourra m'aider

Yo, this is for my motherf— club heads, you feel me? (Yeah)
Ow!
People, gangsters and pimps and people
Smokin' that lethal reefer
Up in the club with speakers
Hi hats, some base and tweeters
DJ is jockin' needles
Sweat 'til I catch a fever
Call me the illest diva
Yo, I'm on fire
People, go 'head and drink up
Get in the club, get fucked up
See me, you got get lucked up
Someone to touch and rub up
Show me some love, strip off your clothes
And take off your socks

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
The party's jumpin', I see something fine
Boy, I wanna kiss you, but I'm just too shy
Let me dance with you, let me wear you out
Here's a glass of orange juice, let's go X it out
The music's bangin' way down in my soul
When you dance behind me, I lose all control
Make me grind my hips, make me move my waist
Yo, when the music come on, you take my breath away

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
This is for my people, my party people
And this is for my people, my mother— people
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)

And this is for my people (Huh?), my ecstasy people
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)
C'mon (C'mon), get down (Get, get on down)

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
I'm at the bar now and I'm buying drinks
And I got this feeling and it's all over me
I wanna dance with you and lick your face
Take me on the dance floor to feel some ecstasy
The vibe is right now and I'm 'bout to score
Mr. DJ, can you play this joint once more?
'Cause I see the man I want, I want him right away
I look him right in his face and say, ""Dance with me""

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
This is for my people, my party people

Can't stand when a nigga fuckin up my plans
All night ducking him while I'm tryna dance
Drunk and his breath stink, freaky with his hands
Cocky with his mouthpiece like he got a fan
Can't stand when a bitch all on my side
I don't even know her and she all up in my light
Givin' me the side eye like she wanna fight
Philly known for boxing, bitch, better get it right
Can't stand when a DJ fuckin' up the song
Know I'm tryin to shake my ass all night long
Cuttin' up the same shit all night long
High 'fore I got there, now my shit is blown
Can't stand when it ain't jumpin' like I want
Bouncer try stop my fun, take away my blunt
I don't give a fuck, he ain't gon' take away my fun
See him when this shit is over, make a nigga run, uh

'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 1]
What on earth am I meant to do?
In this crowded place, there is only you
Was gonna leave, now I have to stay
You have taken my breath away

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, is the world still spinning around? (Spinning around)
Ooh, I don't feel like coming down

It's in your eyes
I can tell what you're thinking
My heart is sinking, too
It's no surprise
I've been watching you lately
I want to make it with you

Destiny has a funny way
When it comes and takes all your cares away
I can't think of a single thing
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in

Ooh, is the world still spinning around? (Spinning around)
Ooh, I don't feel like coming down

[Intro: Pharrell Williams & Justin Timberlake]
Ladies and gentlemen
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine
Yes, yes I am
And he goes by the name... Justin
Wooo
All the way from Memphis, Tennessee
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all about this girl
Come in right here?
Yeah, come on

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake & Pharrell Williams]
On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down (So he said to himself)
She deserves a crown
But where is it now?
Mama, listen

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
Señorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Running fast in my mind
Girl, don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
Or hasn't it been found?
Mama, listen

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
Señorita, I feel for you (Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm (He don't love ya, baby)
But you could feel this real love (Feel it)
If you just lay in my...

[Chorus 2]
Ah, ah, arms
(Won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms
(Mama, lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms
(Baby, won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
When I look into your eyes (Just listen, baby)
I see something that money can't buy (Just hear me, baby, oh)
And I know if you give us a try (I want you, girl)
I'll work harder for you girl (Whoa, oh)
And no longer will you ever have to...

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
(... cry) Señorita, I feel for you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You deal with things (Deal with things), that you don't have to
(Don't have to, oh)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love (Feel it)

[Chorus 2: Justin Timberlake]
If you just lay in my...
Ah, ah, arms
Ah, ah, arms
(Mama, lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms (Yeah)
Ah, ah, arms

When I look into your eyes (Just listen, baby)
I see something that money can't buy (Just hear me, baby, oh)
And I know if you give us a try (I want you, girl)
I'll work harder for you girl (Whoa, oh)
And no longer will you ever have to cry

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Now listen
I wanna try somethin' right now
See, they don't do this anymore
I'mma sing something
And I want the guys to sing with me
They go:
""It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?""
And then the ladies go:
""I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you""
Guys sing:
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
And ladies:
""I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you""
Feels good, don't it? Come on
""It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?""
Yeah, ladies
""I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you""
(Show the good in me)
Sing it one more time:
""It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?""
And ladies:
""I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you""
""It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?""
Ladies:
""I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you""

Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
And I don't understand what happened to our love
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and you're smiling at everyone
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
Out on the road today I saw a deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said, Don't look back
You can never look back"", I thought I knew what love was
What did I know? Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but, I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and your wayfarers on, baby
And I can tell you my, love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B holla

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Chorus: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Chorus: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)

The way you're throwing that thing at me
I can't take it, baby
(Second verse, come on)

[Verse 2: Omarion, (P. Diddy)]
You know that you're teasing me
Gonna have to stop pleasing me
While we're on this floor
(Stop teasing, baby, I want you)
You're kicking it round and round
I love the way you put it down
You're making me scream for more
(Give me more, let's go, don't stop, come on)
Put your two way next to mine
Baby, you me anytime
You and me behind closed doors
(Yeah, talk to me now)
You about to be my main squeeze
Take trips, cop shiny things
(Just me and you)
Girl, just come with me, oh-oh
Now, mama, go 'head, do the damn thing

[Chorus: B2K, Omarion, (P. Diddy)]
Baby, turn around and let me see that sexy body go
Bump, bump, bump
That is all I want to see
Baby, show me, show me
(I like this, come on)
Baby turn around and let me see that sexy body go
Bump, bump, bump
The way you're throwing that thing at me
I can't take it, baby
(Yeah, this is Bad Boy, baby, check this out)
(Call me Diddy)

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
Dance for nothing, mommy, plans to take her by me
Get on the floor, make it bump more, shake it, mommy
Let's ride, I'm your Clyde, you can be my Bonnie
See you the type for me, mommy, so right for me
Man, she can move it, love when she dance to the music
Make me wanna stand like a pool stick
Hands is the smoothest, just a simple touch make me lose it
Girl, that's enough, stop movin'
I bump that, I pump that, girl, bring it to me, bump that
I want that, girl, sing it with me like
(Da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da)
(Da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da)
So let's do it again, mommy, you and a friend, mommy
Money ain't a thing, look, what I gotta spend, mommy?
Put up your hands for me, that's how you dance for me
Shake it like you can, honey, take it from your man, mommy

[Outro: B2K, Omarion, (P. Diddy)]
Baby, turn around and let me see that sexy body go
Bump, bump, bump
That is all I want to see
Baby, show me, show me
Baby, turn around and let me see that sexy body go
(B2K, Bad Boy, they call me Diddy, yeah)
Bump, bump, bump
(Dave Mac, you got one now, baby)
(Don't stop, come on, ha)
(I see you, Chris)
(You know I like it when your body goes)
Bump, bump, bump
(Come on, don't stop, let's go)
(Let's go, come on, ha-ha, let's go)
Baby, turn around and let me see that sexy body go
(You know what it is)
Bump, bump, bump
(Come on, let's go, come on, let's go)
(And another one)
(You know I like it when your body goes)
Bump, bump, bump
(Come on, it's ""Pandemonium"", baby)
(Let's go, yeah, come on, let's go)

107,I Know What You Want (feat. Flipmode Squad),It Ain't Safe No More,Busta Rhymes,2002-11-05,324306,61,"

[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, Shorty, I know what you need
I got everything you need
I promise I ain't gon' hold out neither
I'ma give it all to you, baby
It's burnin' on, bust it

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

[Verse 1: Spliff Star]
We been together for a few years, shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road, hardly ever home
Always busy this, busy that, can't talk on the phone
I know you aggravated, walk around frustrated
Patience gettin' short, how longer can you tolerate it?
Listen, Ma, I'm just motivated
I do this for us, stuck on the grind, tryin' to elevate it now

[Verse 2: Baby Sham]
Ayo, to really be honest you stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express through words how much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man, never above ya
Well, I could tell that you different from most, slightly approach you
And the ill shit about it? We don't sex every day
But when we sex, we tease in a passionate way
I love the way you touch it, those little elaborate ways
Got the god feelin' released to relax for the day
It's on you, Ma

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Shh, Mami listen
I feel your love for me, baby, and how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment to talk the truth to you (Listen)
I'm never home, I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigmarole
I never meant to put a thousand pounds of stress on your head
I love the way we sleep and how we always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' your patience, sheddin' your tears with me
I ask you, my mami, please continue to bear with me

[Verse 4: Rah Digga & Mariah Carey]
We started out broke, constantly on the roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from loosies and buses, and fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed, still got each other back (Yeah, yeah)
Word is bond, never screwed none of these industry cats, boy
We like Scull and Mulder, walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game, watchin' our seeds gettin' older (Yeah)

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you (I'll give it to you)
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it (Gonna give it to you, boy)
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey]
Yes, you know I'll die for you (Uh)
And you know I'll ride wit' you (Come on)
I will always try wit' you (Uh)
And give you my love and cry wit' you (Let's go)
I will climb a mountain high (Uh-huh)
Until our love will touch the sky (Uh)
So baby come and get more close to me (Mariah)
'Cause this is where your love is supposed to be, baby (Tell 'em)

[Verse 5: Rampage]
I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA, you haven't seen me
You lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats, your ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world, you never leave me
Fall back, Ma, I'll make your lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things you do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter, you'll never do me greasy

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

[Letra de ""Caraluna""]

[Verso 1]
¿Quién dice que no duelen
Las huellas en la arena?
Tu huella el mar se la llevó
Pero la Luna sigue ahí
Pero esa Luna es mi condena
Despacio en la mañana
A gritos por la noche
Las voces vivas del recuerdo se disfrazan de intuición
Y en una voz, tu voz se esconde
Y en una voz, tu voz se esconde

[Pre-coro]
Y yo sé que tal vez
Tú nunca escuches mi canción, yo sé
Y yo sé que tal vez te siga usando así
Robándote mi inspiración

[Coro]
Mientras siga viendo tu cara en la cara de la Luna
Mientras siga escuchando tu voz
Entre las olas, entre la espuma
Mientras tenga que cambiar la radio de estación
Porque cada canción me hable de ti, de ti, de ti
Me hable de ti

[Verso 2]
La vida se me esconde
Detrás de una promesa sin cumplir
¿De dónde nace alguna inspiración?
¿De dónde nace otra canción?
Y ya no sé bien quién se esconde
Yo ya no sé lo que se esconde

[Pre-coro]
Y yo sé que tal vez
Tú nunca escuches mi canción, yo sé
Y yo sé que tal vez te siga usando a ti
Robándote mi inspiración

[Coro]
Mientras siga viendo tu cara en la cara de la Luna
Mientras siga escuchando tu voz
Entre las olas, entre la espuma
Mientras tenga que cambiar la radio de estación
Porque cada canción me hable de ti, de ti, de ti
Ay, mientras siga viendo tu cara en la cara de la Luna
Mientras siga escuchando tu voz
Entre las olas, entre la espuma
Mientras tenga que cambiar la radio de estación
Porque cada canción me hable de ti, de ti, de ti

[Puente]
Yo seguiré buscando o seguiré escapando
Tal vez de ti, tal vez de mí
Yo seguiré buscándole una explicación, a esta canción

[Coro]
Ay, mientras siga viendo tu cara en la cara de la Luna
Mientras siga escuchando tu voz
Entre las olas, entre la espuma
Mientras tenga que cambiar la radio de estación
Porque cada canción me hable de ti, de ti, de ti

Ay, mientras siga viendo tu cara en la cara de la Luna
Mientras siga escuchando tu voz
Entre las olas, entre la espuma
Mientras tenga que cambiar la radio de estación
Porque cada canción me hable de ti, de ti, de ti

[Outro]
Me hable de ti (de ti, de ti)
Me hable de ti
De ti
Me hable de ti
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

[Intro: Children's Choir]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music

Knocked up 9 months ago
And what she finna have? She don't know
She want neo-soul, this hip-hop is old
She don't want no Rock n' Roll
She want platinum or ice and gold
She want a whole lot of something to fold
If you a obstacle, she just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary is bad, and these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told her ""Girl, look here, calm down, I'mma hold your hand
To enable you to peep the plan, cause you's quick to learn
We can make money to burn if you allow me to lay this game""
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread my wings
And the world finna know my name

[Verse 2:  Cody Chesnutt]
I don't ask for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow roots standing where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lover's back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine

[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock n' Roll""

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Uh huh, Cadillac need space to roam
Where we heading for? She don't know
We in the city where the pros shake, rattle, and roll
And I'm a gad-dang rolling stone
I don't beg, I can hold my own
I don't break, I can hold the chrome
And it's weighing a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is The Only One
And Black Thought is bad, these streets he done ran
Ever since when the game began
I never played the fool, matter of fact, I been keeping it cool
Since money been changing hands, and I'm left to shine
The legacy that I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much, but enough room to spread these wings
And the world finna know my name, now listen to me

[Verse 4: Cody Chesnutt]
I don't beg from no rich man
And I don't scream and kick
When his shit don't fall in my hands, man
Cause I know how to steal
Fertilize another against my lover's will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Ooh, ooh, ooh no, dear
You'll be keeping my legend alive

[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drop my baby girl tonight
I would name her ""Rock-n-roll""
Oh, break it down, break it down, down for me

[Hook 2: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cause I've taken my test
Deliver it Mary: it don't matter the sex
I'm gonna name it ""Rock-N-Roll""

[Hook 1: Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
If Mary drop my baby girl tonight

I would name her ""Rock-n-roll""

No front just sing the flow

To get to the place we know
Sweat running down my back

There is no turning back
I got my ladies with me
Fellas get cool and freaky
But we've gotta keep them tame
Cos we don't wanna play that game

[Pre-Chorus 2: Keisha]
Everybody from the block
Needs to be feeling nice
It ain't no weakest party
But get up enjoy the ride
What you see and what you hear
Can never be exposed
Acting out of character
Is everything we know

My mind's kind of tender
My body's tired
It's freaky but I'm ready for this bumpy ride
Everybody's tripping
It's all insane
But the voices in my head are saying it's okay
Trying to slow it down
I raced against the rush
Gotta keep it cool to avoid the crush
Adrenaline is spinning and it's starting to show
That I've moved it on
Cos I've changed the flow

[Chorus]
I'm caught up in the middle
Jumping through the riddle
I'm falling just a little tonight (uh uh)
Cos everybody's making trouble
Someone's burst their bubble
But we'll be getting by alright (uh uh uh)

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'

So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll that weed up! (Roll it!)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)

That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at yo' bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs

[Chorus: Fergie]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy
For tryna be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy

[Verse 1: will.i.am & Fergie, Both]
Girl, me and you were just fine, you know
We wined and dined, did them things
That couples do when in love, you know
Walks on the beach and stuff, you know
Things that lovers say and do
""I love you, boo"", ""I love you too""
""I miss you a lot"", ""I miss you even more""
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But then something got outta hand
You started yellin' why I would break plans (What did you say to me?)
Even though I had legitimate reasons (Bullshit)
You know I had to make them dividends (Bullshit)
How could you trust your private eyes, girl?
That's why you don't believe my lies and quick to say

Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy
For tryna be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy (Why, why, why)

[Verse 2: Taboo & Kurtis Blow (& Fergie)]
Why does emotion gotta move so fast?
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin' it slow?
So why has it got to be so damn tough?
'Cause fools in lust could never get enough
Of love; showin' him the love that you be givin'
Changin' up your livin' for a lovin' transition (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen
Screamin' at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin', ""Who the hell?!""
Who the hell? What the hell's goin' down?
Too much of the bickering, kill it with the sound and

Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy (For what?)
(Crazy for what?) For tryna be your lady (Oh yeah?)
I think I'm goin' crazy (Uh, uh), woah-oh

Shut up, just shut up, shut up (What?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Whatcha say?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Say what?)
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up (Girl, whatcha say?)

Girl, our love is dyin'
Why did you stop tryin'?
I never been a quitta
But I do deserve betta
Believe me, I will do bad
Let's forget the past and start this new plan
Why? 'Cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl, I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'Cause I heard them lame damn excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
No, it ain't
That was a different thing
No, it ain't
That was a different thing
It was the same damn thing, same ass excuses
Boy, you're useless, woah, oh!

Seven hours since you went away
Eleven coffees, Ricki Lake on play
But late at night when I'm feeling blue
I'd sell my ass before I think of you

Seven hours since you closed the door
Started a diet, got a manicure
Erased your number from my telephone
And if you call me I won't be at home

[Bridge: All, Mutya]
They say
Why you cry-y-y
For the guy-y-y?
Say goodbye
Run away

Eleven hours on a brand new day
I'm getting ready to go out and play
It's late at night, I'm caught in a groove
I'll kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue

Seven hours, what you calling for?
A bunch of flowers and I'll slam the door
You're in my face, sorry what's your name?
Takes more than begging to reverse my brain
'Cause

Ooh, boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head

This crazy shit
Not feeling it
Can't deal with it
No more, I quit
No more, no more

Breaking off the bun
A brand new day has just begun
Just because you made me go ""ooh""
Doesn't mean I'll put up with you
Don't you dare turn back
Can't you see I won't take that?

Better fill your head up like I told you

Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
The way your body look really make me feel naughty
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
And the way your body lookin', really make me feel naughty

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I got a naughty naughty style and a naughty naughty crew
But everything I do, I do just for you
I'm a little bit of old, and a little bit of new
The true niggas know that the Peas come through
We never cease (No), we never die, no we never deceased (No)
We multiply like we mathematise
And then drop bombs like we in the Middle East
(The bomb bomba's, the base boom dramas)

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
Now y'all know, who we are
Y'all know, we the stars
Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
And, lookin' hard without bodyguards
(I do) what I can

And still I stand, with still mic in hand
(So come on mama, dance to the drama)

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
(Hey) Get on the floor and move your booty mama

We the big town stumpas, and big sound pumpas
The beat bump bumps in your trunk trunkas
The girlies in the club got the plump plump plumpas
And when I'm makin' love, my hip hump humps
It never quits (No), we need to carry nine millimeter clips (No)
Don't wanna squeeze trigger, just wanna squeeze tits
(Lova, lova) 'cause we the show stoppas
And the chief rockas, number one chief rockas

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie]
Now y'all know (Who we are)
Y'all know (We the stars)

Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
The way your body look really make me feel naughty

[Bridge: Tippa Irie & will.i.am]
But the race is not, for the swift
But who really can, take control of it
And Tippa Irie and the Black Eyed Peas
Will be there
'Til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity
Tippa is out

My home is in motion
As darkness unfolds
The air overloaded
My home is in motion
As darkness unfolds
The air overloaded
The sky stands in gold
But you ran away
You left me to stay
We see us in heaven,I'm counting the days

At the end of time, at the end of us, at the end of everything we had
Only faith helps you
Only grace can do
Only you can take the pain
Cause the end of peace is the end of life and the end of any happiness
Only love helps you only trust can do
Only you can take the pain of me

When thunder is calling i feel so alive
The very first morning, can you see the light?
But you close the door, to what i adore
We see us in heaven I´am counting no more

At the end of time, at the end of us, at the end of everything we had
Only faith helps you
Only grace can do
Only you can take the pain
Cause the end of peace is the end of life and the end of any happiness
Only love helps you, only trust can do

You were in my mind
When you took my hand
And we start to dance

And dig myself a hole where I can hide

When I was off in Kansas City, Mo

I heard some things you couldn't print in papers
From fellers who been talkin' like they know

To you I was as faithful as c'n be fer me
Them stories 'bout the way I lost my bloomers—rumors!
A lot of tempest in a pot of tea

I go and sow my last wild oat
I cut out all shenanigans
I save my money, don't gamblе or drink
In the back room down at Flannigans
I give up lotsa other things
A gentleman never mentions
But before I give up anymore
I wanta know your intentions

With me it's all or nuthin'
Is it all or nuthin' with you?
It cain't be ""in between""
It cain't be ""now and then""
No half and half romance will do

I'm a one woman man, home lovin' type
All complete with slippers and pipe
Take me like I am, er leave me be!
If you cain't give me all, give me nuthin'
And nuthin's what you'll git from me

[Verse 1]
Disco dancing with the lights down low
Beats are pumping on the stereo
Neighbours banging on the bathroom wall
Your sayin' crank the bass
I gotta get some more

[Refrain]
Waters runnin' in the wrong direction
Got a feelin' it's a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Something funny's goin' on inside my mind
Don't know what is pushin' me higher
It's the static from the floor below
Then its drops and catches like a fire
It's a sound I, it's a sound I know

[Chorus]
It's the sound of the underground
The beat of the drum goes round and round
In to the overflow
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio
Out to the electric night
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights
The beat goes around and round
It's the sound of the under
Sound of the underground

[Verse 2]
Chain reaction running through my veins
Pumps the bass line up into my brain
Screws my mind until I lose control
And when the building rocks I know it's got my soul

[Refrain]
Waters runnin' in the wrong direction
Got a feelin' it's a mixed up sign
I can see it in my own reflection
Something funny's goin' on inside my mind
Don't know what is pushin' me higher
It's the static from the floor below
Then its drops and catches like a fire
It's a sound I, it's a sound I know

The beat goes around and round
It's the sound of the under
Sound of the underground

Boom, boom, boom
Ha-ha!

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks—thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

I love the way you move
I love the way you move, wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a manwhore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out ""Timber!"" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend/boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
I like the way you move
I like the way you move, wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move, wooo
I love the way you move

[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown]
Hey, baby, girl, don't you stop it
Come on, lady, dance all around me
(Look so fine) You look so fine (Look so fine)
You driving me out of my, out of my mind
Out my mind, ooooh, baby
If I could, I would just be with you, baby
Oooh, 'cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, woo!

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
I like the way you move (I like the way you move)

Spiriti potenti, vi invochiamo
Vegliate su noi, che stanotte balliamo
Volti a la luna, alta la fronte
Danzano le streghe di Gabry Ponte

Quando è notte e il lupo grida all'ombra della luna
La danza delle streghe non porta mai fortuna

Fuochi e spiriti ballate dentro al cerchio della luce
Tramontate stelle, anime sorelle!

Dodici rintocchi squarciano la notte scura
La danza delle streghe, signore di paura

Dalle tenebre sorgete, lento il fuoco nero brucia
Spettri nel castello, fate il vostro ballo!

Think of you at a rate

By pretending that she still loves me

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about your love

Ohh, yeah

Can't believe I could think that
She would just follow me everywhere I go
I just wrestle with you in my dreams
And wake up making love to a pillow
And I fall asleep and dream
Of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease
By pretending that she still loves me

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop, and I can't stop

You look in my direction

Attract your attention
And I touch myself like it's somebody else

Cómo le encanta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)

[Verso 1]
Ella prende las turbinas, no discrimina
No se pierde ni un party de marquesina
Se acicala hasta pa' la esquina
Luce tan bien que hasta la sombra le combina
Asesina, me domina
Janguea en carros, motoras y limusinas
Llena su tanque de adrenalina
Cuando escucha reggaetón en las bocinas

[Coro: Daddy Yankee & Glory]
A ella le gusta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)
Cómo le encanta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)
A ella le gusta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)
Cómo le encanta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)

Aquí somos los mejores, no te me ajore'
En la pista nos llaman ""Los Matadore'""
Tú hace' que cualquiera se enamore
Cuando bailas al ritmo de los tambore'
Esto va pa' las gatas de to's colore'
Pa' las mayore', pa' las menore'
Pa' las que son más zorras que los cazadore'
Pa' las mujeres que no apagan sus motore'

Tenemo' tú y yo algo pendiente
Tú me debes algo y lo sabe'
Conmigo ella se pierde
No le rinde cuentas a nadie
Tenemo' tú y yo algo pendiente
Tú me debes algo y lo sabe'
Conmigo ella se pierde

Zúmbale mambo pa' que mis gatas prendan los motore'
Zúmbale mambo pa' que mis gatas prendan los motore'
Zúmbale mambo pa' que mis gatas prendan los motore'
Que se preparen que lo que viene es pa' que le den
¡Duro! Mamita, yo sé que tú no te me va' a quitar
¡Duro! Lo que me gusta es que tú te dejas llevar
¡Duro! Todos los weekend'es ella sale a vacilar
¡Duro! Mi gata no para 'e janguear, porque

This one is dedicated to dem heart-broken lovers

Last night I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didn't want no one to hold you
What does that mean?
And you said:

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Oh no (oh no) I've got to keep on movin'
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no (oh no) I've got to keep on movin'

Reaching out to all dem
To dem lovers
Who cannot find demselves, you know

You're on the road and now you pray it lasts
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're running so fast?
And you said:

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin'
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin'

Nothing gonna break my stride, I'm gonna keep on movin'
Ca me na stand still me gonna keep on grovin
While me walk down the street of revolution
Hear the sound of freedom till I reach Mount Zion
Nobody slow me down, and I won't touch ground
Feel Jah Jah present, an I feel him all around
Good vibration ina you an me, will bless eveybody ina community

Never let another guy like you, work me over
Never let another guy like you, drag me under
If I need another guy like you, I will tell him
Never want another guy like you, have to say, oh

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Oh no (oh no) I've got to keep on movin' (Woman)
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no (oh no) I've got to keep on movin' (I said)

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin'

Beca me keep on movin'

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride

Break my stride

I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin'

OH OH

AH AH AH
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down, oh no

Got to slow me down, down, down, down, down know
I've got to keep on movin'
Nothing gonna drop me drop me under
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground, oh no

Nothing gonna break my break my stride

Spen Cow, baby

[Verse 1: Christina Milian]
Says he wants you, he says he needs you
It's real talk, then why not make him wait for you?
If he really wants you, if he really needs you
Really got to have you
Take your time and feel him out
When he's a good boy, I mean a really, really good boy
Why not let him lay with you?
That's when you give it to him good

[Chorus: Christina Milian]
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh""
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh""

[Verse 2: Christina Milian]
You're gettin' bold, it’s growin' cold
It's just the symptoms of young love growin' old
You think it's time
Then you're thinkin' of leavin', but give it time
It's late at night, he's comin' home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hand, let him know it's on
If you understand me, ya'll, come on

All my ladies wind it up If you know just how to move (Know how to move it on)
All my fellas jump behind and show her what you wanna do (Ooh, ooh)

Dip it low, pick it up slow (Oh)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh""

Dip it low (Ooh), pick it up slow (I'mma show you how to make it)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go (Said I'mma show you how to make it)
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh""

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh
Baby girl, the way you pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I might stop to shop and cop you things
You know I drop the top and hop that thang
Sometimes I stop my bop to pop my thing
You sure know how to make a man say, ""Oh""
And how in the world can a man say, ""No""
When you grind it up on the wall, wind it up like a doll
And you know I Bacardi, lime it up till you fall
Line it up 'till you spoiled
And have those other chicks throwin' vomit up
When they can't find it up in the mall
Like most men, I love to catch up with a model
But I ain't used to movin' slow like ketchup in a bottle
And the best things come to those who wait for it
But I'mma be straight for before it's too late for it
I want you to dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out and make me say, ""Oh""

[Chorus: Christina Milian]

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rollie on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes? See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide-wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear
Talkin' all that raspy shit, tryin' to ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it—take a second (Ding)
Matter-fact, you should take four, B
And think before you fuck with lil' Skateboard P

Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah, I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side—yeah, that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much, you thought I was a DJ
""Two, one, yep, three!""
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles
Waitin' on the Pizzle, the Dizzle, and the Chizzle
G's to the bizzack—now, ladies, here we gizzo!

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot

Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a bad boy, with a lot of hoes
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen, and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose!

[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But, oh

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you 'cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Did you really need me?
Or were you just using me?
I never felt so used, i won't go back to you. so leave me alone
I wasn't good enough, it was never about us. so leave me alone
I've had enough of your kiss
The touch of your hand, i won't miss
I've been wrapped up in all your crazy ways
I'm caught up in your web of lies
Gonna cut myself loose and say goodbye
Bye. bye. i don't want you. i don't need you...

Through the texture
Come and get a taste of the fixture

Ah, uh, whoo, yeah! Ready?
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Let's go!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington (& Mike Shinoda)]
(Can I get a encore, do you want more?)
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Get 'em Jay!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that!
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
God damn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspira-tion-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington (& Mike Shinoda)]
Encore, do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Outro: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington]
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (More, more, more)
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

I was mixed up when you came to me
Too broke to fix, said daddy get you gone
I'm missing my baby
Still missing my baby

I was stitched up by the hands of fate
Said how you gonna make it on your own if luck is a lady?
Maybe luck is a lady

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions
I had so many questions
That you just kissed away

Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can you set you free

So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my savior would come
I think it's amazing
I think it's amazing

I think you're amazing

You tried to save me from myself
Said darling, kiss as many as you want
My love's still available
And I know you're insatiable

We're like victims of the same disease
Look at your big bad daddy and your mom
And your mom, was always acting crazy

I was going down for the third time
My heart was broken
I thought that loving you was out of the question
(loving you was out of the question)
Then I saw my reflection (reflection)
Saying please don't let this go

Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can you set you free

So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my savior would come
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing

(Celebrate the love of the one you're with) x18

Celebrate this life with you baby
I think you should celebrate, yeah
Don't put your love in chains, baby
Now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought I would see love
I think it's amazing
I think you're amazing

I said celebrate the love of the one you're with

Celebrate!
Celebrate!
As this life gets colder
And the devil inside
Tells you to give up, baby
Now I walk in the midday sun

In the world flashing from your eyes

Down, okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (Ah-ah), beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape""
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body

[Verse 3]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby
Fellas (What?) Fellas (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin', it's the season
Just go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass

When I wake up in the mornin' love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
Then somethin' without warnin' love
Bears heavy on my mind
Let's get them dollars, let's get this money
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
I got my finger on the trigga', stayin' on the grind
And when I wake up in the mornin', I gots to hit a lick
Saw the two thousand and three Navi, on Sprees wit' a kit
Soon as my eyes see the sunshine
My thoughts is jukin' the block, and dodgin' the one time
Peep how we movin' the rocks and wit' pounds of dro before I double my shit
I can serve sixteen ounces for six and get back ninety-six
A killa' for the skrilla', nigga', best not be stalkin'
I gots to get them bigga', figga's, fuck what you talkin'
I represent them nigga's ballin' wit' jewelry full of zickels
Down to the nigga's chasin' million, their dreams servin' nickels
And I know, one day, I'm gon' come up
And when you see me, don't hate, that I rolled up
Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'cane
Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs
Gotta get that money man
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
It's lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day

A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that
I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks
And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs
I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto
Semi-auto and Marlboro's in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto
Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words
My nigga' flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds
I got the, mentality and the motive I'm on a mission
For the money, you can get it too, it's all about yo' ambition
Play yo' position, provide the plans, and follow procedures
In the six-hundred, blunted, wit' a pocket full of hundred's and Visa's
Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up
Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when the grip stack up
It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems
Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar
Gotta get that money man
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
Got love for the corporate playa's that's ballin' rollin' jags
Got love for the thug nigga's who get it on the ave.,
Love for those, who can make a mil' and sit back and laugh
And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass
Love for the single parents that's workin' through the struggle
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle
Love for those who gotta watch the hater's rollin' bubbles
Causin' trouble every time a young brotha' try to hustle
And if I can't, legally make or not
Then I gotta get, right back on the block
And if it no work we do a stick-up and whip-up a concoction
Might leave yo' face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money man
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
When I wake up in the mornin' love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
Somethin' without warnin' love
Bears heavy on my mind

[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his?

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

[Chorus 2: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

But oh wait, whoa y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm

What you too cute to dance? Or you scared?
It ain't really that hard to do and
I ain't trying to be in love with you and
All I wanted was a moment or two to
See if you could do that Switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one too and

See if y'all can do that Switch-a-roo

Pu-push the button
Push the button

[Verse 1: Heidi]
I'm busy throwing hints that he keeps missing
Don't have to think about it I want a kiss
And everything around it but he's too distant
I wanna feel his body, I can't resist it
I know my hidden looks can be deceiving
But how obvious should a girl be?
I was taken by the early conversation piece
And I really like the way that he respect me

[Pre-Chorus: Keisha]
I've been waiting patiently for him to come and get it
I wonder if he knows that he can say it and I'm with it
I knew I had my mind made up from the very beginning
Catch this opportunity so you and me could feel it 'cause

[Chorus: All]
If you're ready for me, boy
You'd better push the button and let me know
Before I get the wrong idea and go
You're gonna miss the freak that I control

[Verse 2: Mutya]
I'm busy showing him what he's been missing
I'm kind of showing off for his full attention
My sexy ass has got him in a new dimension
I'm ready to do something to relieve this mission

[Pre-Chorus: Keisha]
After waiting patiently for him to come and get it
He came on through and asked me if I wanted to get with him
I knew I had my mind made up from the very beginning
Won't miss this opportunity so you and me could feel it 'cause

You're gonna miss the freak that I control

I've been dropping so many hints (push the button, pu-push the button)
You're still not getting it (pu-push, pu-push the button)
Now that you've heard everything I have to say (push the button, pu-push the button)
Where we gonna go from here? (pu-push the button, push the button)

[Intro: Busta Rhymes & The Pussycat Dolls]
Okay (Ahh), yeah (Ahh)
Oh, we about to get it
Just a lil' hot and sweaty in this motherfucker (Ooh, baby)
Ladies, let's go (Uhh), soldiers, let's go (Dolls)
Let me talk to y'all and just, you know
Give you a little situation... listen (Fellas)

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes & The Pussycat Dolls]
You see this shit get hot, every time I come through
When I step up in the spot (Are you ready?)
Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
Prowl for the best chick, yes, I'm on the lookout (Let's dance)
Slow bangin' shorty like a belly dancer with it
Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta with it (Ooh, baby)
No tricks, only diamonds under my sleeve
Gimme the number, but make sure you call before you leave

[Verse 2: The Pussycat Dolls & Cee-Lo Green]
I know you like me (I know you like me)
I know you do (I know you do)
That's why whenever I come around, she's all over you
And I know you want it (I know you want it)
It's easy to see (It's easy to see)
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be (ah) with me (Ahh)

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha? Don't cha?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha? (Ah-ah-ah) Don't cha?

[Verse 3: The Pussycat Dolls & Cee-Lo Green]
Fight the feeling (Fight the feeling)
Leave it alone (Leave it alone)
'Cause if it ain't love
It just ain't enough to leave a happy home (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
Let's keep it friendly (Let's keep it friendly)
You have to play fair (You have to play fair, yeah)
See, I don't care
But I know, she ain't gon' wanna share (Ah, ah-ah)

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls & Busta Rhymes]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me? (Oh)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me? (Like me)

Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me? (Big fun)
Don't cha? (Ah-ah-ah) Don't cha?
(Okay, I see how it's goin' down
Seem like shorty wanna little ménage pop off or somethin'
Let's go)

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Well, let me get straight to it
Every broad wanna watch a nigga when I come through it
It's the God almighty, lookin' all brand new
If shorty wanna jump in my Aston Vanquish
Lookin' at me all like she really wanna do it
Tryna put it on me 'til my balls black and blueish
You wanna play with a player, girl, then play on
Strip out the Chanel and leave the lingerie on (Ha)
Watch me and I'mma watch you at the same time
Lookin' at you wanna break my back
You're the very reason why I keep a pack of the Magnum
And with the wagon, hit you in the back of the Magnum
For the record, don't think it was something you did
Shorty all on me 'cause it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get cold so I could hit the both of y'all

[Verse 5: The Pussycat Dolls & Cee-Lo Green]
See, I know she loves ya (I know she loves ya)
I understand (I understand, yeah)
I'd probably be just as crazy about you if you were my own man
Maybe next lifetime (Maybe next lifetime)
Possibly (Possibly)
Until then, old friend, your secret is safe with me (Shhh... hot)

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me? (Oh)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me? (Like me)
Don't cha? Don't cha, baby?
Don't cha? Alright, sing
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me? (Raw)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me? (Big fun)

[Letra de ""La Tortura"" ft. Alejandro Sanz]

[Intro: Alejandro Sanz]
Ay payita mia, guardate la poesia
Guardate la alegria pa' ti

[Verso 1: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
No pido que todos los días sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdón
Si lloras con los ojos secos
Y hablando de ella
Ay, amor, me duele tanto (Me duele tanto)
Que te fueras sin decir a dónde
Ay, amor, fue una tortura perderte

[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adios

[Verso 2: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas
Ay, amor, me duele tanto, me duele tanto
Que no creas más en mis promesas
Ay, amor, es una tortura perderte

[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adiós

[Verso 3: Alejandro Sanz]
No te bajes, no te bajes
Oye negrita, mira, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
Déjame el sábado a mi que es mejor
Oye mi negra, no me castigues más
Porque allá afuera, sin ti no tengo paz
Yo sólo soy un hombre muy arrepentido
Soy como el ave que vuelve a su nido

[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Es que no estoy hecho de cartón
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón

[Outro: Shakira]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay todo lo que he hecho por ti
Fue una tortura perderte
Me duele tanto que sea así
Sigue llorando, perdón
Yo ya no voy a llorar hoy por ti

[Intro]
Yeah, Shady, Aftermath, G-Unit
Damn baby all I need is a lil' bit
A lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Get it crackin' in the club when you hear the shit
Drop it like it's hot, get to workin' that back
Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round

[Verse 1]
I step up in the club I'm like ""Who you wit?""
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin' to beef, I'm tryin' to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'mma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'mma get in shorty ear and I'mma let her know

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit

[Verse 2]
This is 50, comin' out your stereo
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh man""
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit

[Bridge]
Baby you got me feelin' right, you heard me?
My momma gone you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin' I'm tryin' to fuck tonight, you heard me?
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon, ha ha

All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see me gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
I'm ridin' with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up!""
Next to the PlayStation controller
It's a full clip in my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma (Woo!)
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin' oak (Oak)
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow (Slow)
Twin's steady twistin' like, ""Hit this though!""
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
The windows down, got to stop pollution
CD change, niggas like, ""Who is that producin'?""
That's the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston but I still ain't losin'

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I've been drinkin' and smokin'
Holy shit, cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home 'fore the po-po's scope this
Big old Excurs' just swervin', all up in the curb and
Nigga be sippin' on the Hennessy and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt and roll another one up
We livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' 'bout the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me, on the lowkey
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, ""Fuck 'em all""
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, and get it poppin', dawg
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Now would you think it's so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rearview and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin'
Keep steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags (Tags)
Pull me over, try to check my slab (Slab)
The glove compartment, gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Jammin' number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, tell 'em, ""We hate you""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home
And it's on

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don’t wanna tell you what it is
Oh wee it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but

So why I keep picking up my cell?

Maybe I just can’t believe it
It’s this one thing you did oh oh

Nothing left to do but to keep on seeing you
I’m hoping you can keep a secret
For me, for me, for me
But what you did, yeah

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, uh-huh
So seductive

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop (Yeah)
Want one taste of what I got? (Uh-huh)
I'll have you spendin' all you got (Come on)
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm tryin' to explain, baby, the best way I can
I'll melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (Ha-ha)

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Want one taste of what I got?
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

[Bridge: 50 Cent & Olivia]
Girl, what we do (What we do)
And where we do (And where we do)
The things we do (Things we do)
Are just between me and you, yeah (Oh yeah)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Want one taste of what I got?
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Want one taste of what I got?
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

[Produced By: Cool & Dre]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Verse 2: The Game]
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Intro]
There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that I wait, the more time that I waste

[Verse 1]
I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way
I'm not afraid of what I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my own road and I can make it alone
I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my own

[Chorus]
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to jump

We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me
The only thing you can depend on is your family
Life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see

Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?

[Intro]
Uno por pobre y feo, home, pero antojao'
Ah, hijueputa

[Verso 1]
Tengo la camisa negra, hoy mi amor está de luto
Hoy tengo en el alma una pena y es por culpa de tu embrujo
Hoy sé que tú ya no me quieres y eso es lo que más me hiere
Que tengo la camisa negra y una pena que me duele

[Pre-Coro]
Mal parece que solo me quedé
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Qué maldita mala suerte la mía
Que aquel día te encontré
Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós
Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo

[Coro]
Tengo la camisa negra porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perdí la calma y casi pierdo hasta mi cama
Cama-cama, come on, baby, te digo con disimulo
Que tengo la camisa negra y debajo tengo el difunto

[Interludio]
¡Pa' enterrártelo cuando quieras, mamita! ¡Juya!
Así como lo oye, mija

[Verso 2]
Tengo la camisa negra, ya tu amor no me interesa
Lo que ayer me supo a gloria hoy me sabe a pura
Miércoles por la tarde y tú que no llegas, ni siquiera muestras señas
Y yo con la camisa negra y tus maletas en la puerta

[Pre-Coro]
Mal parece que solo me quedé
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Que maldita mala suerte la mía
Que aquel día te encontré
Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós
Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo

[Coro]
Tengo la camisa negra
Porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perdí la calma
Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama
Cama-cama, come on, baby
Te digo con disimulo
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y debajo tengo el difunto

[Coro]
Tengo la camisa negra
Porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perdí la calma
Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Don't hold back, 'cause you woke up in the morning
With initiative to move, so why make it harder?
Don't hold back, if you think about it
So many people do, be cool man, look smarter
Don't hold back, and you shouldn't even care
'Bout the losers in the air and their crooked stares
Don't hold back, 'cause there's a party over here
So you might as well be here where the people care

[Hook: The Chemical Brothers & Q-Tip]
Don't hold back, world (You're holding back)

Come on, come on, come on with it

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Don't hold back, if you think about it too much
You may stumble, trip up, fall on your face
Don't hold back, you think it's time you get up
Crunch time like a sit-up, c'mon keep pace
Don't hold back, put apprehension on the back burner
Let it sit, don't even get it lit
Don't hold back, get involved with the jam
Don't be a prick, hot chick be a pig

[Hook: The Chemical Brothers & Q-Tip]
Don't hold back, world (You're holding back)
The time has come to
World (You're holding back)
The time has come to

Come on with that, come on with it

That you just don't know

Will see, will look just like before

'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Outro: Kanye West]
We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Hey baby, my nose is gettin' big
I noticed it be growin' when I be tellin' them fibs, now
You say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learned my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it, I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I've been a little immature
With your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies, I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie

'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games
She feelin' like a fool gettin' on the last train
Tryna maintain, but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

[Pre-Chorus 1: apl.de.ap, Fergie, will.i.am]

[Verse 1: 2-D]
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing 'cause I don't get to sleep, no
(*beep*)

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Verse 2: Trugoy the Dove]
Laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (Yeah)
Care Bear repping in harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
Until you're cheddar headed
And watch the way I navigate, hahahahaha

Yeah, Polow Da Don, it's Fergie

We flying first class, up in the sky
Popping champagne
Living my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy

[Verse 1: Fergie]
Wear them gold and diamond rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limousines, shopping for expensive things
I be on the movie screens, magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell, drive-through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show or after the Grammy's
I like to go cool out with the family
Sipping, reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm...

[Chorus: Fergie]
First class, up in the sky
Popping champagne
Living my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous

Ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I'm talking champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous, Robin Leach will get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Taking trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home

[Bridge: Fergie]
I got problems up to here, I got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy things that I don't wanna know (Fuck y'all)
I got money in the bank and I'd really like to thank
All the fans I'd like to thank, thank you, really though
'Cause I remember yesterday, when I dreamt about them days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn, it's been a long road and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

[Outro: Fergie & (Polow Da Don)]
(If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it!)
My daddy told me so

How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't, have a player ’bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
How you lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I’m curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I’m tired of runnin', let’s walk for a minutе

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you’re still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothin' on
Feelin' on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P like Steve Nash?

My stone heart was breaking, my love ran away
This moment I knew I would be someone else
My love turned around and I fell

Be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover, but don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy, but understand

You can be my bad boy, but understand
That I don't need you again
No, I don't need you again

Bad boy!

You once made this promise to stay by my side
But after some time, you just pushed me aside
You never thought that a girl could be strong
Now I'll show you how to go on

Be my bad boy, be my man
Be my weekend lover, but don't be my friend
You can be my bad boy, but understand

I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're —""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase""
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)

Can we try again to start a new and lovely story
That will shine a ray of light upon our hearts
And bring back long lost glory
Of how it used to be
Baby you and me
Convinced we were each others destiny
My heart cries out to you
You must forgive me
I've been dancing in the dark
And searching for a spark
Of fire still burning
I believe we'll make it through
If you stand by me
We can weather any storm
And keep each other warm
As long as there's love
Every time I think of us my eyes are filled with tears
To think that I gave in to sweet temptation
His words like music to my ears
I hope it's not too late
That you still await
Oh please tell me that you're still having faith
My heart cries out to you
You must forgive me
I've been dancing in the dark
And searching for a spark
Of fire still burning
I believe we'll make it through
If you stand by me
We can weather any storm
And keep each other warm
As long as there's love
Hmmm
But faith is not mine
And if I could I'd unturn
The hands of time
My heart cries out to you
You must forgive me
I've been dancing in the dark
And searching for a spark
I believe we'll make it through
If you stand by me
We can weather any storm
And keep each other warm
As long as there's love
Never enough
Love

[MORGAN (spoken)]
One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods...

[ANNIE (spoken)]
Jack, hurry up! Come on!

[JACK (spoken)]
Just a second. Sugar maple...

[MORGAN (sung)]
On a day just like any other

[ANNIE]
What're you doing?

[JACK]
Making notes. Rough bark...

[MORGAN]
In the woods not very far from home

[ANNIE]
Jack! I'm a monster!

[JACK]
Star-shaped leaves...

[MORGAN]
As they walk, a sister and brother...

[ANNIE]
Grrrrrr!!!

[JACK]
Annie, cut it out!

[ANNIE]
Oh, come on, Jack! Play with me!

[MORGAN]
Argue

[JACK]
No! I'm too old to play pretend

[ANNIE]
No you're not!

[JACK]
Yes I am!

[ANNIE]
Are not!

[JACK]
Am too!

[MORGAN]
But today what they say doesn't matter

[ANNIE]
Jack, it's not pretend! I'm a monster!

[MORGAN]
For today in the woods they're not alone

[ANNIE]
Jack, look!

[JACK]
Annie, stop!

[MORGAN]
Today at the top of a ladder

[ANNIE]
No, really! Look!

[JACK]
Where?

[ANNIE]
Over there!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[MORGAN]
There's a magic place where wishes can come true

How far can you see

[ANNIE]
I'm climbing up!

[JACK]
Annie, don't! We don't know who it belongs to!

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[JACK]
Annie!

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
What?

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[ANNIE]
It's full of books!

[JACK]
Really?

[ANNIE]
Yes! Look!

[MORGAN]
When you venture outside your window

[ANNIE]
Books about knights! Ninjas! And...oh, wow!

[JACK]
What?

[ANNIE]
Dinosaurs!

[JACK]
Hold on, I'm coming up!

[ANNIE (sung)
Books about faraway places
Pictures of wondrous sights to see

[MORGAN]
To go there, all that it takes is wishing

[ANNIE (spoken)]
See?

[MORGAN]
A wish to have an adventure

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[MORGAN]
A wish from the top of a tree

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[MORGAN]
A wish to be there -- and then you're flying

[JACK]
I've never seen so many books in my life!

[MORGAN]
How far can you see

[JACK]
Look at that! Polar bears!

[ANNIE]
Awwww...

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[ANNIE]
And look at this one! It's all about pirates!

[JACK]
Let me see that!

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[JACK]
Pyramids!

[ANNIE]
Pilgrims!

[JACK]
Planets!

[MORGAN]
When you venture outside your window

[JACK]
Prehistoric pterodactyls!

[ANNIE]
What?

[JACK]
Dinosaurs!

[ANNIE]
Oh, right

[JACK]
Oh, man. This is amazing. I really wish we could go there...

(The Tree House spins)

[JACK and ANNIE]
AIEEEEEEE!!!

[ANNIE]
What happened?

[JACK]
I...I don't know

[ANNIE]
Where are we?

[JACK]
It...it looks like the picture in the book

[ANNIE]
Yeah, *exactly* like it

[JACK]
There's the palm tree...

[ANNIE]
There's the volcano...

[JACK and ANNIE]
AND THERE'S THE DINOSAURS!!!

[ANNIE]
Let's go!

[JACK]
Annie, wait!

[ANNIE]
Come on, I want to pet a dinosaur!

[JACK]
How're we going to get home?

[ANNIE]
We can worry about that later! Come on!

[JACK]
Annie, wait! I'm coming!

[MORGAN (spoken)]
That day, Jack and Annie discovered that the Tree House is magic -- and later they found out that it belongs to me, Morgan le Fay, of Camelot. Since that first day in the woods, they have had many wondrous adventures...and we have become friends...

[ANNIE]
Morgan! Hi!

[MORGAN]
Welcome back! Did you have fun?

[JACK]
Yep. We did

[ANNIE]
And look what we brought you!

[JACK]
It's a mango! From a rainforest!

[ANNIE]
And a moonstone! From a real ninja!

[JACK]
And look! A mammoth bone from the Ice Age!

[ANNIE]
This is the best summer we've ever had!

[JACK and ANNIE (sung)]
We saw dinosaurs before dark

[JACK]
A knight at dawn

[ANNIE]
We only had to make a wish

[JACK]
And whoosh! We were gone!
To visit mummies in the morning

[ANNIE]
Sail with pirates past noon

[JACK and ANNIE]
We're going out for a minute, Mom
We'll be home soon!

[JACK]
After a night of ninjas
Back in old Japan

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[ANNIE]
Or an afternoon on the Amazon

[JACK]
With crocodiles and monkeys and a big python!

[ANNIE]
Yikes!

[JACK]
We might set out through the ice and snow

[ANNIE]
To see the sun set on a sabertooth
A million years ago

[JACK and ANNIE]
Or maybe even travel
Far above the world we know
Arrive at midnight on the moon
And watch the earth revolve below!

In the Tree House there's no limit
If we wish it when we're in it
And the magic starts to spin it
There's no limit, just no limit
There's no limit to the places we can go!

[MORGAN (sung)]
How far can you see

[ANNIE]
My brother and me

[JACK]
My sister and me

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[ANNIE]
From the top of a tree?

[JACK]
From the top of a tree?

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[ANNIE]
So many places to go

[JACK]
So many places to go

[MORGAN, JACK, and ANNIE]
When you venture outside your window

[JACK (spoken)]
Oh, man! Remember riding the dolphins?

[ANNIE (spoken)]
Yeah! And visiting the tigers, and the kangaroos...

[JACK]
And the gorillas!

[ANNIE]
Awwww...I loved the gorillas!

[JACK]
Sailing on the Titanic!

[ANNIE]
That was really scary

[JACK]
The ghost town was scary, too

[ANNIE]
Yeah, and the twister, and the earthquake, and the volcano...

[JACK]
Yep. All scary

[ANNIE]
It was fun meeting Shakespeare, tough. And George Washington

[JACK]
And the pilgrims. And the Dragon King

[ANNIE]
And Clara Barton. And King Arthur

[MORGAN]
How far can you see

[JACK]
Yeah. King Arthur

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[ANNIE]
What was the very most fun for you?

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[JACK]
Mmmm... I think I'd have to say Hawaii

[ANNIE]
Yeah, Hawaii was great

[MORGAN]
When you venture outside your window

[ANNIE]
We sure have been to a lot of places

I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a goddamn thang changed
It’s the same old same

I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day-to-day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower-livin'?

Nigga killed a Crip and a Blood in the hood

It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by Five-O
Grandmama came to court with her Bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled
Owned by C.A, State Property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?

Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the 4-4 up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming, but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
D game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' them up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Aye, y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
‘Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

Cómo grande mueve la cola

Dale sin miedo, rompe la consola
La pistola chambonea
Ella lo vuelve loco cómo se menea
Bailando es pura candela
Lo vuelve loco cuando se acelera, y pela

State of emergency
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
One at a time, baby
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we can be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me, girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Chorus: Keri Hilson, Timbaland, Both]
Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I are?
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I ain't got no Visa

Talk to me, girl

So listen baby girl
When I make it, I want you there, want you there, yeah

[Verse 4: Sebastian]
Yeah my money ain't aloof like Phil and them
And it's really not quite low as LSN
Your body ain't Pamela Anderson
It's a struggle just to get you in the caravan
But listen baby girl
Before I let you lose a pound, I'll buy a bigger car
So listen baby girl
I love you just the way you are, the way you are

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's all right, now you ain't gotta flaunt for me

Destination unknown!

I left my job, my boss, my car and my home
I'm leavin' for a destination I still don't know
Somewhere nobody must have beauties at all
And if you like us you can follow me
So let's go!
Follow me and let's go!
To the place where we belong
And leave our troubles at home
Come with me, we can go
To a paradise of love and joy
A destination unknown!

Now I won't feel those heavy shoulders no more
My life got better now I finally enjoy
Yes all the people wanna come here and so
Come on and join us, you can do that now
Let's go, follow me and let's go!
To the place where we belong
And leave our troubles at home
Come with me, we can go
To a paradise of love and joy
A destination unknown!

Destination unknown!

We left the city, the pollution, the crowd
The air is clear here, ocean's blue, I love that sound
We're happy in this destination we found
And if you want us you can follow me
Now let's go, follow me and let's go
To the place where we belong
And leave our troubles at home
Come with me, we can go
To a paradise of love and joy

And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now, thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit!

There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right

We wanna get away up front

[Verse 1: Akon, Gwen Stefani]
Shorty I know you, and you know me
Imma find ways to get to that cheese
Steady trynna stake, run off in them streets
Similar to Bonnie and Clyde on TV
Ain't nobody driving me crazy
But my money, pride and my lady
Please don't go, we're too far to chase it
Been to close for me to escape it
So I, jumped up in the Audubon of my my Maserati
Switched up real quick and peeled off in my Bugatti
Girl, Imma run away with you
Let me rub all over your body
When you can run away with me
While I kick back watch you get naughty

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl (forever), perfectly together
Tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
If I could be sweet, I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt (whatsoever)
We can make it better
Tell me boy, wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)

If I could escape
If I could escape

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
You melt me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl (forever), perfectly together
Tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
If I could be sweet, I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)

Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?

Not a day pass me by
Not a day pass me by
When I don't think about you

And there's no moving on
'Cause I know you're the one
And I can't be without you

Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

Can we bring yesterday back around?

Make you wanna touch it, make you wanna taste it
Have you lusting for it, going crazy, face it

And dance in your lap 'til ou ready to pop

Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that—that there should be 'gainst the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin', shawty, we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Let me talk to you

Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

[Verse 2: Katie]
I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last drip standing up against the wall
Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
Getting clamped up and sitting on the fence now
So alone all the time at night
Lock myself away, listen to me, I'm not
Though I'm dressed up out and all
With everything considered, they forget my name

[Chorus: Katie]
They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me 'quiet' girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

[Chorus: Jules]
This song was in my head
Now it's in my mind
Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
And though I realize
I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around but just don't promise, nothing binding
And baby, can't you see
That you're so desperately
A standing joker like a vocal one-liner
Instead of sing-a-long
This song is monotone
I've gotta get some soul, I gotta get some feeling

[Bridge: Katie]
Are you calling me Darling?
Are you calling me Bird?
Are you calling me Darling?
Are you calling me Bird?

[Chorus: Katie]
They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me 'quiet' girl
But I'm a riot

Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

[Part I: LoveStoned]

[Intro]
Hey! Uh
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it
Listen

[Verse 1]
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight
And she looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
Ooh, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
Hey!

[Chorus]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh

[Post-Chorus]
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it
Yeah

[Verse 2]
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
Well, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
Hey!

[Chorus]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare (Cause a glare)
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare (I had to stop and stare)
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows

[Post-Chorus]
Now dance
Get it, girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this song one time

[Break]
Ow!

[Chorus]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh

[Instrumental Break]

[Part II: I Think She Knows (Interlude)]

[Chorus 1]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh

[Chorus 2]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
(Those flashing lights come from everywhere)
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare (Stop and stare)
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
And now I walk around without a care (Without a care)
She's got me hooked, it just ain't fair, but I
I'm love stoned and I could swear that she knows
I think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, oh

Mmmm, mmm
Oh, oh

278,What Hurts The Most,Perfect Day,Cascada,2007-12-03,219000,0,"

[Verse 1]
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most was being so close
And having so much to say (Much to say)
And watching you walk away (Walk away)
Never knowing what could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do

[Verse 2]
It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder getting up, getting dressed, living with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

[Chorus]
What hurts the most was being so close
And having so much to say (Much to say)
And watching you walk away (Walk away)
Never knowing what could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do
Oh, oh
Hey, hey

[Bridge]
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most was being so close
And having so much to say (Much to say)
And watching you walk away (Walk away)
Never knowing what could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do
What hurts the most (What hurts the most was)
Was being so close
And having so much to say (Much to say)
And watching you walk away (Walk away)
Never knowing what could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do

When it seems like the world around you's breaking
And it feels like there's no one else around you
And it's quiet, there's a silence in the darkness
And it sounds like the carnival is over

As you walk in the crowded empty spaces
And you stare at the emptiness around you
You wanna go to the city and the bright lights
And get away from the sinners that surround you

Cause I will be there and you will be there
We'll find each other in the dark
And you will see and I'll see it too
Cause we'll be together in the dark

Cause if it's coming for you then it's coming for me
Cause I will be there
Cause we need each other in the dark

And if it terrifies you then it terrifies me
Cause I will be there
So we've got each other in the dark

As I look into the sky, the sparks bright as ice
You want me to take you over there
I want you to stay with me
Cause you're not the only one
The only one

No no
Don't worry, you're not the only one

Cause if it's coming for you then it's coming for me
But I will be there
Cause we need each other in the dark

And if it's panicking you then it's panicking me
But I will be there
So we've got each other in the dark

In the dark

We'll hold each other in the dark

[Verse 1]
It's always the same
Always ashamed storytelling
When I can't come in
To a hopeless troglodyte
But one more time my answer stands
I swear I mean no offense
But you better learn to read
It's all 'bout membership

[Verse 2]
I spell it for the young and old
Ugly girls and boys
I put you on my list
And make you clap to this
Is it mayhem or just an ego trip
Only one can win
And soon you'll say ""that's him""

I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll, ah
Ah, well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, mmm
I want somebody to speed it up for me, then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?

Tell me, how 'bout you?

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 2]
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Bridge]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Intro]
Hold on tight, you got it
We will not be quiet
She cannot be silenced
Never doubt your power
Better ask about her
You don’t want no problems, no
Do you know who you are girl?
Lady you’re a goddess

[Verse 1]
Why you be pressing me, why you be nagging me
Why don’t you just back it up, I blow a bag
Buy you a back for against you possessive
Angry aggressive, always stay mad at me
Yeah I am the baddest bitch, only they savages
Them niggas challenged them so had to retaliate
I have his back so I picked up his slack for him
Though got to heavy now they call me masculine
Oh you gay, you must have been raped
Anything you can do I can too
You can’t get [?] thinking logical
No way that is not possible
Get out of line, I slapped the snot out of you
Give up the drugs, you’re a thot or a prostitute
Constantly doubting you
Lack of confidence from doubting you
You’re valuable girl, I’m so proud of you
You’re still smiling like the sky’s the bluest
Disguise and bruises, don’t know how you do it
Going through it, girl you got Adonis
You’re the truest, has more to offer than just making babies
Told to sit down and then act like a lady
Stay in your place, where is that exactly
Not in the kitchen cooking cleaning the dishes
So early not over your knee
Watch the way that you’re talking to me
Damn it all these double standards
Praise the man against the panics
No strings attached
Pump that pussy then that Plan B
I don’t want it, I won’t claim em
Bring they ass back, we didn’t plan it, who you been with?
I can’t stand ya, how you even know that I’m the dad?

[Bridge]
Hold on tight, you got it
We will not be quiet
She cannot be silenced
Never doubt your power
You better ask somebody
You don’t want no problems now
Do you know who you are girl?
Lady you are a goddess, you are a goddess
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Told her things
Sold her dreams
Offered her everything except a wedding ring
Planted seeds without watering
She never really blossomed fully, she was 17
Lies and infidelity
No promises, no expectancy
She’s expecting now
He was absent the whole pregnancy
Re-routed her destiny
She was on the right path
That post-partum hit her hard with the right jab
Stopped answering the calls, doesn’t write back
He was only interested in [?]
You know, a little nightcap
Oh I hurt you girl, my bad, I thought you like that
She just wants her life back
This is what happens when you bring her down, you take the crown
She’s taking downers, over counter, got her guard up
Out here wildin’, acting childish, bashing cars in
Can’t you see that she's scarred
She’s been enduring with a broken heart, my god
There is so much damage, you’re so demanding
Brought her closer then left her stranded
No closure, it’s open-ended
Co-dependent, incoherent, can’t compare it, loose cannon
Can hardly manage, feeling famished
Wishing she could vanish
Trying not to panic
Got to get established
Too late in the game
Still gonna take a stab at it
And desperately for change
I desire better for myself
That requires for me to start asking for some help
Taking baby steps, trying to do my best
Been tested, more than the rest, life ain’t fair, but I’m not upset
Reminded every day, I cannot forget
[?] and conquered out of shit

[Outro]
Hold on tight, you got it
We will not be quiet
She cannot be silenced
Never doubt your power
You better ask somebody
You don’t want no problems now
Do you know who you are girl?
Lady you are a goddess, you are a goddess

Don't treat me to the things of the world
I’m not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here’s a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I’m the one you want
If you don’t, you’ll be alone
And like a ghost, I’ll be gone

Can you rise to the occasion?
I'm patiently waiting, 'cause it's getting late
And I can't get enough, so let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up
That's what I'm saying

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot

Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right

Hey!
My first flo' stuck on a gold diggin' woman
Money cash flow, all big face hunneds
Stuntin' on the pole, got them D-boys runnin'
Shorty got both broke, can't see what's comin'
Wear them apple bottoms, wear them apple bottoms honey
Dolce and Gabbana, and she get it from her mommy
Louis bag kit, Gucci, Fendi and Armani
See them karats on her wrist, now she pimp Bugs Bunny
Used to date Kanye, now she want me
Flo Rida got the juice, wanna take my OJ
It ain't her birthday but her name on the cake
If I ever pay for nookie grade A

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Hey!
My third flo' stuck on the hoodrat shone
Cut, take one, Hollyhood act on
Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone
Tattoo tight work, bought the ""Low"" ringtone
Plenty ghetto booty, plenty ghetto booty on her
Roll up with kitties, don't smoke Arizona
One night stand, one night with the clan
One night, one time broke her off ten grand
Project all the way, gutter all day
Pure uncut, stain wall with a J
Shorty don't fake, she'll put it in your face
Three stories by them hoodrat's beg

Never thought that I'd fall in love (x4)

Being without you girl, I was all messed up (x4)
When you walked out, said that you'd had enough (x4)

Been a fool, girl I know
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time, you'll change your mind
Now looking back i wish i could rewind

Oh I stay up till you're next to me

Remember telling my boys that I'd never fall in love (x4)

[Verse 1]
If the fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And the tears rolled into the ocean
And now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion

[Chorus]
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

[Verse 2]
I look up into the night sky
And see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel a weight of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real

[Chorus]
'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
That it's all just a bunch of matter

Hands, touching hands, reaching out
Touching me, touching you
Oh, sweet Caroline
Good times never seem so good
I've been inclined to believe it never would

And now I, I look at the night, whooo
And it don't seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two, oh
And when I hurt
Hurting runs off my shoulder
How can I hurt when holding you

Oh, one, touching one, reaching out
Touching me, touching you
Oh, sweet Caroline
Good times never seem so good
Oh I've been inclined to believe it never would

One, two, three sing!

Ohhh, sweet Caroline, good times never seem so good
Oh I've been inclined to believe it never would

Ohhh, sweet Caroline, good times never seem so good
Sweet Caroline

[Verse 1]
You can hide your eyes, you can dim the lights, but they are watching
This is a new time with a different kind, they are the future
The only one
It's a final call for the setting sun when they get closer
And with a fall from grace thy will be done, the show is over
It's a new dawn
Just leave this place behind
I'll clear your bloodshot mind
They only wanted your life on demand
This is a better way

[Verse 2]
They were standing by, no time to hide, no meeting halfway
You were sucking life through the needle's eye, this is a new day
And they have won
We will surrender now or be outdone, left in the open
It's the cooling of the horizon, they are the future
The future
When all your fears combined
The manifest was refined
I know you really tried to understand
This is a new way
(It's a new dawn)
(It's a new dawn)
(It's the only one, the only one)

319,Human - Ferry Corsten Radio Remix,Human (Remixes),The Killers,2008-09-22,266906,23,"

I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought, but I was kind

And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart
Cut the cord

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could

And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well
You've gotta let me go

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer

You've gotta let me know
Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Are we human or are we dancer?
Are we human or are we dancer?

Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

[Verse 2]
Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

[Verse 3]
Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feelin' blue
The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nike's
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

[Chorus]
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night

A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (Uh)
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you about it

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
I just want to enjoy (Uh)
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)

Your touch is so magic to me

Just do what I taught you girl when I give you my heat
And I need you to push it right back

It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party

[Verse 1]
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not going in
Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned on to love until it's cheap
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet

[Chorus]
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

[Verse 2]
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There's certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt

[Chorus]
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

[Bridge]
This time I'll be bulletproof
This time I'll be bulletproof

[Chorus]
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof
(This time, baby, this time, baby, this time, baby, this time)
This time, baby, I'll be bulletproof

I wake up everyday it's a daydream
Everythin' in my life ain't what it seems
I wake up just to go back to sleep
I act real shallow but I'm in too deep

Everybody says that I gotta get a grip
But I let sanity give me the slip

Some people think I'm bonkers
But I just think I'm free

Some people call them players
But I'm far from terrified
'Cause somehow I'm drawn to danger
And have been all of my life

It feels my heart's divided
Halfway 'tween wrong and right
I know I'm playing with fire
But I don't know mind

Yeah, the bad boys are always catching my eye

Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
Ooh (Bad boys)

Some think it's complicated
But it's straight up fun for me (Oh, oh)
I don't need no explanation

She like them tougher than leather
Not even the paws, it's more like a mama bee
Out lost that's on the reg'lar
By any means necessary, girl
She likes them ruthless, that's my world
It's not the news, it's what I heard
To get them more the merrier
It's not a big surprise

Look at her walk when I go in disguise
You'll have them shawty, don't worry, you fly

Haha, not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

[Break: Kanye West]
Keep rocking, and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, our kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around
And you knocked me down, knocked me down

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes, love comes around
(Love comes around, love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes, love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I never thought I'd hear myself say (Say, mmm)
""Y'all go 'head"" (Oh)
""I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today""
(Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander-in-chief
On my pimp shit, flying high (Flying high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile (Oh)
That shot me out the sky (Oh, shot me out the sky, uhh)
Hit, so now, I'm crashing (Don't know how it happened)
But I know it feels so good
Said if I could go back and (Make it happen faster)
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could? (Oh)
Miss Independent (To the fullest)
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)
I swear to you, the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes, love...

[Chorus: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Sometimes, love comes around (Ayy)
(Love comes around, love comes around)
Oh, it comes around
And it knocks you down (Hey, hey)
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Ooh, when it knocks you down, oh (Hey)
Sometimes, love comes around (Ooh-ooh, yeah, comes around)
And it knocks you down (Oh, whoa)
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
(When it knocks you down, knocks you down)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
That seemed to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby; we just happened
So, please, don't mess up the trick
""Hey Young World,"" I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice?
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying; now, I'm crashing
This is bad, real bad—Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad—Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask him

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
(Whoa, whoa) Mmh-mmh, I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
(Whoa, whoa) And if it hits better make it worth the fall
When it comes around, hey

[Chorus: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo, Both]
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around, love comes around)
Comes around, whoa
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Get back up when it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around (When love comes around)
When love comes around
And it knocks you down (Eh-eh, oh-oh)
Just get back up when it knocks you down (Eh-eh, oh-oh)
Knocks you down
Knocks you down

[Outro: Both, Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Won't see it coming when it happens (Eh)
But when it happens (Uh-huh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Oh, no, when it knocks you down
Won't see it coming when it happens (Oh oh)
But when it happens (Ooh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now (Tell you now)
You see when love comes and knocks you down

Grandma's cooking breakfast; she makes pancakes the best
I check my MySpace and I've got a lot of friend requests

I get to dancing as I, walk through my mansion cause I
Own property from California to the Hamptons and I
Sip from my water fountain that dispenses soda
Look out the window and wave at my next door neighbor Oprah
I check to see how my album's doing today
The group LMFAO goes double platinum, hey
I gotta party, man, that's how I live
So I take my elevator to the club in my crib like

[Letra de ""Virtual Diva""]

[English Translation]

[Intro]
D-D-D-, D.O.!
Diesel!
‎iDon!

[Verso 1]
Ella es ese sueño, que tuve despierto
Un recuerdo leve, de esto que siento
Una sacudida, a mis salidas
La cima de un beso en un brinco suicida
Su fuente de energía cautiva mis sensores (D-, Don!)
Pues no hay que la controle (¡Ey!) cuando baila encendí'a (Buh)
Tiene dentro esa chispa que quema transistores
Y bebe de un elixir que enciende sus motores

[Estribillo]
Salió a la disco a bailar una diva virtual
Uh, chequea cómo se menea (¡Ey!)
Uh, uh
Chequea cómo se menea
Uh, uh-uh
Chequea cómo se menea

[Refrán]
(¡Don!)
Tiene algo de robot en su táctica
Me agotó la batería su técnica
Su modelo vino con cintura plástica
Con los movimientos de la mujer biónica

[Verso 2]
(She's on fire!)
'Tá encendí'a, con la sangre high, prendí'a
Hoy no quiere ver la luz del día
No trajo brújula, esta noche anda perdí'a
Su sistema seductivo calentándose (¡Ey!)
Mientras que su frecuencia esta sintiéndose (¡Auh!)
Su fluido corporal está exportándose
Robótica en la pista, está luciéndose (D.O.!)

[Estribillo]
Salió a la disco a bailar una diva virtual
Uh, chequea cómo se menea (¡Ey!)
Uh, uh
Chequea cómo se menea
Uh, uh-uh
Chequea cómo se menea

Me agotó la batería su técnica (¡Ey, ey!)

[Verse 1: Rob Swire]
It's been so long, I've been out of my body with you
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true
You took me to a place where my senses gave way
Turn it round, shut it down, what the people say
Climbing up, killing time, let 'em give you some
Take my hand and let it come, let it come, let it..

Take it back when she knows that you're doing it right
Cause everybody else knows what they're taking tonight

But I just wanna play it right
We're gonna get there tonight

[Verse 2: Rob Swire]
It's been so far, I've been walking the line on my own
Lift me up to the stars, we are coming home
I know we had a chase but we're out of time
We have sold in the cold, physical design
Set me free, set me out on the run
Lift me up to the sun, to the sun, to the

When you're burning down, when you're burning down

I just wanna take you down

I'm coming 'round and now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind, then I would disappear
The love I get from you is something I can't chance
And I could let you slip away without a second glance

Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaah, woaaah
Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Woaaah, woaaah

This is like a flashback, this is like a dream

Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down?
Down, down

You oughta know
Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show
I wanna see how you lose control

So leave it behind
'Cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape

So baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry

Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down?

Just let it be
Come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away
Turn this place into our private getaway

So leave it behind
'Cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape
So why don't we run away?

Baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry

Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is fallin' down?

Down like she 'posed to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature
'Cause to me she zero degrees

She cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas
Now she's my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier, please?

I'm fightin' for this girl
On the battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby cupid
Sent her arrows from above?
Don't you ever leave the side of me
Indefinitely, not probably
And honestly, I'm down like the economy

Baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry

Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(And the sky is falling down)
Down, down
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(Are you down? Are you down?)
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down?
(And the sky is falling down)
And the sky is falling down

We can fight our desires
(Ooh) But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot

They say we can love who we trust
(Ooh) But what is love without lust?
Two hearts with accurate devotions
(Ooh) What are feelings without emotions?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

And not let go of my hand

I hang my hopes out on the line

If you leave them out too long

Full stops and exclamation marks (Ah-ah)

How far can you send emotions? (Ooh-ooh)

Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold

You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
For next year

God, I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door

I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
No?
