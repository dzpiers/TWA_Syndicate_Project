If you could ever love me half as much
As you could love yourself
We'd have a big house and a big old tree
For us and no one else

[Pre-Chorus]
What's hiding behind those sad eyes?
Don't start with those lies
I can only love you twice as much
Before you fuck this up

[Chorus]
You're clumsy, oh, love
You keep me hanging on
Am I not enough?
Don't keep me hanging on
I've got to be strong
Tell me I'm the only one
You're clumsy, oh, love
Is she ever gonna go away?

[Post-Chorus]
Is she ever gonna go away?
Is she ever gonna go away?
(Never going away, never going away, hey
Never going away, never going away, hey)
[Verse 2]
Sun's in the sky, it's hard to see
When the clouds keep moving in
Sleep through the day, walk through the night
I don't know where to begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Where were you when I called?
Don't start with those lies
I can only love you twice as much
Before you fuck this up

[Chorus]
You're clumsy, oh, love

Alive
All of the colour in the night
Laying down beside my side
And the restless in your eyes
To reach before the morning rise
Out on the street corner again
I turn around and see my friends
Some get forward, some get low
But no one knows which way to go

[Chorus]
Rock it to the break of day
Don't stop rocking now, no way
Everybody feels the same
This is why we play these games
Rock it to the early dawn
Soon those real good times will be gone
And everything I ever had
If I could have one night like that

[Verse 2]
C'mon
DJ, play us one more song
We've been waiting all night long
We're just about to lose our minds
So play that rhythm one more time
And now they're clearing out the floor
We never made it there at all
Still not ready to go home
But no one knows which way to go
[Chorus]
Rock it to the break of day
Don't stop rocking now, no way
If everybody feels the same
This is why we play these games
Rock it to the early dawn
Soon those real good times will be gone
And everything I ever had
If I could have one night like that

""If you’re feeling low, then give it a go! Try Lambert’s Sniffing Salts today""

[Intro: Suffa]
You know when you're doing a song about a small town
You gotta start it with a cliché, you know what I'm sayin'?
Like...

[Verse 1: Suffa]
Time moves a little slower here
The paint peels, 'cause the summers here are so severe
And we're nowhere near nowhere you would know of
Locals here ride, they show up just to show off
Old men take a load off, just to watch the day go by
Philosophising with their friends like they're Plato
They prophecise on the bench by the main road, right
They got advice; I’m like 'Ayo, if you say so, guys'
But what do they know? Fox News got 'em lit
They’re shook, 'cause fundamentalist the new communist
Old girl with her shopping list clutch her handbag close
I’m like 'Damn, ma'am; Dan, this old bag has jokes'
'Cause I'm a gentleman, but then again, most of us are
First name basis in the bank, the post-office, the bar
The grocer, the park, so lady, I ain’t tryna grab your pension
The old men on the bench hum
[Interlude 2: Tom Thum]
""Direct from the transistor radio in your lounge room; It’s the entertainment that the whole family can enjoy""
""Well, I say, looking slick will do the trick, so try Barry’s Brylcreem today!""

[Chorus: Montaigne & Suffa]
Well, let's go, let's go
We're living in the days when everybody sayin'
""What a time to be alive""
But I'm feeling out of place like I live in outer space
'Cause it seems I'm stuck in time
It's like we ride through life
Right in the shadow of the Cold War
It gets so quiet at night
Like martial law took a hold y'all, '55

[Verse 2: Suffa]
Time moves a little slower here
A day feels like a week, a week, it feels like it could go a year
And we're nowhere near nothing, man, it's so true
I don't tell 'em where I'm from, I tell 'em where I'm close to
And I can go through an atlas and show you on a map but
You'd still look at me sideways and treat me like I'm backwards
But that's just fine, it so happens I'm
Happy living in a city that is trapped in time
While you're lined up in traffic, I'm
Not panicked 'bout transit, I'm back in time
For a TV dinner and an early night
'Cause we get dressed to travel, got an early flight
Been doing laps of the earth while doing laps of the sun
Tryna put where I'm at on the map 'cause where I'm from
We never get a mention, but all that and then some
Once again, the old men on the bench hum
[Interlude 3: Tom Thum]
""And across the country, they came in waves. Thousands upon thousands of flying discs descending from the planet Mars""
""For the closest shave, try a Wilson’s razor today""

[Chorus: Montaigne & Suffa]
Well, let's go, let's go
We're living in the days when everybody sayin'
""What a time to be alive""
But I'm feeling out of place like I live in outer space
'Cause it seems I'm stuck in time
It's like we ride through life
Right in the shadow of the Cold War
It gets so quiet at night
Like martial law took a hold y'all, '55

[Bridge: Montaigne]
Where I go, where I go
This will always be home, no matter
Where I go, where I go
This will always be home, no matter
Where I go, where I go
This will always be home, no matter
Where I go, where I go
This will always be home

[Interlude 4: Tom Thum]
""If you can't beat the summer heat, then what you need is a Wordell's. Wordell Refrigerators: the cooler choice""
""The dieting revolution taking the world by storm""
[Chorus: Montaigne & Suffa]
Well, Montaigne, let's go
We're living in the days when everybody sayin'
""What a time to be alive""
But I'm feeling out of place like I live in outer space
'Cause it seems I'm stuck in time

Yeah, I was on my way to a face-to-face

Falling at your feet daily

Don't treat me dumb, trying to see it both ways

Do you feel, do you feel that you feel too much?

Cause where we're going, no one knows

So don't forget me or what you want

So I can dance in your light and to your rhythm
Soon it unfolds who we are in this masquerade of stars
Tear off the mask, the face you hide is what I'm missing

One was turning, one was standing still
I won't forget what was promised here

I don’t like it at all
Do you see the ways that we have gone too far?
Drifting off of our course
Do you see the ways that we’ve let plastic cover the ocean like snow?
Snow it always melts
With the seasons change and the summers help
One’s cold water and one was oil before
Oh, how much there's left to learn

Lately I’ve been worried
I don’t know where to it is that I do belong
Lately I’ve been too busy
To smell the bottle brush
Just chasing laps around the sun
I’ve sat here and cried, salt running from my eyes
Wondering, ""How the fuck will I end up with you?""
You just laugh and smile
Shake your head and remind me that
All good things can come true
Oh, how much there is left to learn

Do you see the way that we have gone too far?
We need now more than ever before
To come together put our differences apart
Stop drifting off of our course
Do you see the ways that we need our reefs just like our trees along the shore?
If it knows to help
Half of what we breathe in for ourselves
Is out of sight and on the ocean floor
Oh, how much there is left to learn
Lately I’ve been worried
I don’t know where to it is that I do belong
Lately I’ve been too busy
To smell the bottle brush
Just chasing laps around the sun
And I’ve sat here and cried, salt running from my eyes
Just wondering, ""How the fuck will I end up with you?""

Everybody knows that Sally can’t dance
But damn she’s so fine that nobody’s gon' tell her
Two left feet, one beautiful smile
Hot damn she’s so fly whenever we’re together

[Verse 1: Tuka]
And here we go yo, I think it was a Friday night
I was kicking it at my place, aight...
I could feel my thigh vibrate, Sally's on my cell phone
She was at a club but she was by her self though
Sipping on a Bombay, telling me to drop by
I could be her hot date, Jiggy in the spot light
Karaoke contest, she was gonna rock mics
We could sing Beyoncé songs till the clock chimes
One in the morning and the party was boring
When I walked in Sally must have caught me yawning
She said “Quit stalling boy meet me on the dance floor
I’ma cut a couple shapes up like a band saw”
So under the disco ball we all
Shake it like a Polaroid singing la-di-da
Down and dirty yo, Sally ain’t no Barbie doll
Goofy as hell but who cares, blasé blah

[Chorus: Mataya & Tuka]
Everybody knows that Sally can’t dance
But damn she’s so fine that nobody’s gon' tell her
Two left feet, one beautiful smile
Hot damn she’s so fly whenever we’re together
[Verse 2: Jeswon]
Once upon a time in my neighbourhood
Me and all of my next-door neighbours would
Get the whole block jumping to the latest jams
Rocking out to the sound of our favourite bands
I remember one summer on a Friday night
We had Morg dog spinning so the party's hype
I saw my home girl Sally from across the way
An intelligent lady with a lot to say
She had a shimmer in her eyes and a smile to match
Skinny waist line but the style is fat
Just a glimpse of her face it could brighten the mood
Any place that she went she would light up the room
I was like let's bust a groove, she said “cool”
But she moves like she's rocking two busted shoes
She got two left feet and can't work the beat
She can't dance but Sally’s still perfect to me

[Pre-Chorus: Mataya & Tuka]
I don't wanna hurt nobody, I just wanna move my body
She's sweet like marmalade, and tastes like oooh la-la-la
La—la—la-la-la-la—la—la
A-la-di-da, a-la-di-da-di-da, ayy
A-la-di-da, a-la-di-da-di-da

Everybody knows that Sally can’t dance
But damn she’s so fine that nobody’s gon' tell her
Two left feet, one beautiful smile
Hot damn she’s so fly whenever we’re together
[Bridge: Tuka]
She don’t foxtrot, two-step or minuet but
She’s so fresh I don’t interject
There’s no skip to her lou or the do–si–do
But that's cool I could still be her Romeo
You know

I don't wanna hurt nobody, I just wanna move my body
She's sweet like marmalade, and tastes like oooh la-la-la

Nothing makes me happier than watching you win

Where the aliens drink, watching dishes build up in the kitchen sink
And they're placing their bets, hanging their heads, got money on who’s gonna die in bed
Who’s gonna play with themselves again
Who's breaking down mentally next

But how nice is it, that I can watch you win
I couldn’t care less which world I'm in

Against this pretty smoke screen out in outer space

The more you know the less you care
Science and God are just uncomfortable underwear

Shame on me for always saying something uncool, but when we're both dead we'll probably get a swimming pool

One for me and you and the other three to skateboard

But I look better in blak
If I knew what I know now
Maybe I would take it back
But fuck that
I look better in blak

Do you know what it feels like
To be told that you are never right?
If I had lighter skin, maybe I would win
Does it make you want to think?
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause I know what it feels like
If I had lighter skin, maybe I would win
Does it make you want to think?

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I just keep quiet
I'll be the one who's lying too
Why should I keep hiding? Always crying
Tell me, what did I do?

[Chorus]
You took the colour from me
Darling, I'll get it back
(I'll get it back, I'll get it back
I'll get it back, I'll get it back)
You took the colour from me
But I look better in blak

Maybe I would take it back

And I know it's bad
But I just can't wait
Till you feel in love
When you see my face
Well, I go to bed
But I'm still awake
When you go to bed
Do you sleep like a babe?

I just want coffee for breakfast
I just want warm cups of tea
I just might love you forever
I hope you warm up to me
I hope your dreams are amazing
I hope your dreams are amazing

My dad, he worked out west
And he worked so hard
My mum she smells like cigarettes
And they broke each other's hearts
She says that love is like a chess game
And boys gotta do the chasing
But when did I start taking her advice?
I raised myself and that's alright

I want coffee for breakfast
I want warm cups of tea
I'm gonna love you forever
I hope you warm up to me
I hope your dreams are amazing
I hope your dreams are amazing
Hope your dreams are amazing
I hope I maybe sneak my way in, I'd like that

[Verse 3]
Oh, I was really feeling nothing
But you got me feeling something
And it's heartfelt like ice melts when winter turns to spring
And I keep your pictures like a hoarder
I think about you when I sing
Said you can lead a horse to water but you can't always make it drink

[Chorus]
So I drink coffee for breakfast
I want warm cups of tea
I just might love you forever
I hope you warm up to me
I think you might be my angel
Think you might be an angel
I think you might be an angel

You want someone to want you for who you are
I want someone to try, then let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight

[Verse 1]
Honey, it’s no secret that with matters of the heart
Unreserved, I’m irrational and rarely ever start
But since the world’s dark and often inhumane
Relish our condition, come drinking in the rain
‘Cause you remember when, after Paris
We all decided the best way to fight it was
Drink wine, dance here and pray
And make love that lasts with a vengeance
So you can join the cowards all aboard the outrage train
You can stay afraid, or slit the throat of fear and be brave
And scratch the little itch 'til you’re moving like a motherfucker
Up in this bitch

[Chorus]
You wanted to fight for a cause
Then go out and fall in love
Don’t stop, don’t stop believing
In truth and grace in the grievance
You want someone to want you for who you are
I want someone to try, or let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight
[Verse 2]
So look at me and tell me what I already know
That I trialled and I failed and it’s good to let it go
Sometimes life sucks, everything is lame
Not everything’s as easy as making lemonade
And so dismembering our state of balance
With lust requited, a gaze undivided
With a cool mind and warmth in your face
A good heart, a grace under pressure
You give me a good reason to be heartsick again
To be here, to be strong, to be oddly and boldly estranged
From the loss and bitter years
I found myself descending into tedium and fear

[Chorus]
You wanted to fight for a cause
Then go out and fall in love
Don’t stop, don’t stop believing
In truth and grace in the grievance
You want someone to want you for who you are
I want someone to try, or let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight

[Bridge]
If it’s late, you’re drunk and wanting
A reason, some reason to live
I always, I always say
Just put on some Whitesnake
[Verse 3]
Honey, it’s no secret that I’ve been losing my way
In the weirdest of moments and the stupidest of ways
But hey, I’m still young and it’s gonna be okay
I got solipsism, baby, and I brought lemonade
I’ll surrender then, all my balance
And be excited and drink to tonight
It’s not a, a bad time, time spent with you
There’s cool lights and songs with good lyrics
We never have to talk again, whatever, up to you
But since you’re putting up with me
Here’s another toast just to you
Let’s dance, off the beat
Then mosey out together and say goodbye on the street

[Chorus]
You wanted to fight for a cause
Then go out and love someone
Don’t stop, don’t stop believing
In truth and personal freedom
I want someone to want me for who I am
I want someone to try, or let me down easy, easy tonight
Easy, easy tonight

When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
If you're waiting all your life, you won't ever go
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home

Some things are simple and hard to ignore
They say, hmm, the truth is like that
We're getting colder, so far from the shore
I say, hmm, the world is like that
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't see you
But I hear your call
Baby, hold on now

If we make it or we don't, we won't be alone

If you're waiting all your life, you won't ever go
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
When I see your light shine

There's a place that I
Wanna run with you
Darling, there's a place that I
Wanna run with you

[Chorus]
We're going home
If we make it or we don't, we won't be alone
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
If you're waiting all your life, you won't ever go

I was like, ""What you want me to do?""
She was like, ""What, you want me to choose?""
I was like, ""Well, I didn't say that, but you know
Help me help you""
I'm on that balance beam to keep you happy
Or say, ""Fuck it"", stay mad at me
Know how that goes: drink, fight
Patch things up in the back of a taxi
She can skate thin ice on wheels
And not once get wet
She could walk fine lines in heels
Not one foot out of step
And I swear I'll leave you swept
Off your feet, it's just, I guess
I'm falling hard myself here
Yeah, over my head

Headed for the deep end
Thursday, we fight and forget it by the weekend
Fast learner, I figured out quick
With her, it's not the getting, it's the keeping
'Cause she's a gem
So everyone wants her shining with them
Gettin' my bulldog on, bro, mind your step
Keep it on your side of the fence
I play my demos, one last one
Smile if she likes it, laugh if it sucks
Cold blooded, she the first in my corner
But now, what's that if it ain't called love? Huh
When it's all said and done
Baby ain't happy till my head's spun
So I might get lucky, I might get none
Like I'm right back at square one
Feels like I'm

Reminiscing about us in Vegas

To tell you out of all the moments in my life
The ones I got to share with you were probably my favourite

Lately I've found
When I start to think aloud
There's a longing in the sound
There is more I could be
In darkness I leave
For a place I've never seen
It's been calling out to me
That is where I should be

[Pre-Chorus]
We never carried days on our own
But now it's up to us to know
The weight of being so much more
We will find ourselves on the road

[Chorus]
On we march
With a midnight song
We will light our way
With our lanterns on
On we march
Till we meet the dawn
We will light our way
With our lanterns on
[Verse 2]
As we walk out
Without question without doubt
In the light that we have found
It is finally clear
Our day has come
And we'll stand for who we are
We are ready we are young
We have nothing to fear

[Pre-Chorus]
We never carried days on our own
But now it's up to us to know
The weight of being so much more
We will find ourselves on the road

With our lanterns on
On we march
Till we meet the dawn
We will light our way
With our lanterns on

We held the light
To our faces
And realized
We were chasing
Shadows behind
Not worth saving
So burn it bright
Forever illuminating

On we march
With a midnight song
We will light our way
With our lanterns on
On we march
Till we meet the dawn
We will light our way

Tryna forget you is just a waste of time

[Chorus]
Baby, come back, any kind of fool could see
That there was something in everything about you
Baby, come back, you can blame it all on me
Well, I was wrong and I just can't live without you

[Verse 2]
All day long, I'm wearing a mask of false bravado
Tryna keep up a smile that hides the tears, oh
But when the morning comes, I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here

[Chorus]
Baby, come back, any kind of fool could see
That there was something in everything about you
Baby, come back, you can blame it all on me
Well, I was wrong and I just can't live without you

[Bridge]
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
[Chorus]
Baby, come back, any kind of fool could see
That there was something in everything about you
Baby, come back, listen, baby, you can blame it all on me
Well, I was wrong and I just can't live without you

And stay, stay, stay, another round
'Cause who wants to live forever?
Who wants to burn it down?
Down, down, down, down
And we can paint the town
'Cause who wants to sing the blues?
So some you win or some you lose
It's all a catch-22

[Verse 1: Illy]
Yeah, I could be getting old, but I'm getting round
Call it immature, sure, but hear me out
'Cause the only thing promised is the here and now
If we didn't live it up, never live it down, yeah
And when I jump I hold on, I'm like, ""Oh my Lord""
If it all goes wrong then it's all my fault
Man, some just want to watch your world burn
But some on the straight and narrow lost first turn, so
Before you play, take a page of my own advice
It's all a game, know the price when you roll the dice
And what's the rush man? Nowhere else to go tonight
And we ain't getting out on time, let alone alive
The choice is yours, your down for the cause
Be hated or adored, but never ignored
And whatever card you draw you can't win them all
So leave the sad songs at the door, get involved and
[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Illy]

[Verse 2: Illy]
Oh, you're not happy where you at heart, fuck it off then
Just make it not for nothing when you cut your losses
You haven't got it made, but you got your options
Ditch smokes for sleep, ditch shots for crossfit
What you tryna live longer? Take a bow
What's the point of all those years if you spend them missing out?
Some of it's worth the risk, hoping you don't forget
Bad as the world can get none of it's permanent
So no politics or parties, even if
We solving world problems with our lager on our lips
And for all the easy ways out, the harder that it gets
Now isn't that ironic? No Alanis Morissette
We a hard act to follow, pouring the bottle
YOLO the motto, could all end tomorrow
Set your watch fast, stay ahead of your time
If you wait, might never arrive, that's the vibe so

You might think I'm crazy, but that shit don't phase me
I'm still figuring it out

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a real good feeling, it's gonna be alright
Not gonna live forever, but we know the best part is the ride
No matter where we're going, it's gonna be alright
Not gonna live forever

[Chorus]
But right now the best part's what we don't know
Take a little step into the unknown
Everybody tryna to tell me no-no (no-no)
I wanna bless the rains and dance away like Toto wherever I go

[Verse 2]
Got no plan, just gonna see where I end up
Do what I can, and see how far I stretch my luck
Now that it's all behind me, maybe I miss it slightly
I'm still figuring it out

But right now the best part's what we don't know
Take a little step into the unknown
Everybody tryna to tell me no-no (No-no)

Why did I go and leave so soon?
I should have said that I would stay, stay for you
What would you go and do with me?
Could I give you what they gave, gave to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I came to find you
This doesn't mean I wouldn't lie to you
And this couldn't mean I'm good enough for you, no
Because I came to find you
This doesn't mean I wouldn't lie to you
And would you drink yourself loose?

Both hands on my face
Kiss me like you're lonely

Kiss me like you're lonely

Why did I say so soon
That I could be something else?
Someone new
You can love parts of me
The ones that I never gave you

You could be my little dream
I'll read you like a magazine
While we're bored and while we're young
The viewing is easy
But I was at the first to come
To realise what I hadn't done
Something I caught in a gun
For something so easy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my heart stitched love

Used to be in love but you ran off
Used to get along but you ran away
Frozen to the feeling when you backed up
You took my heart when you ran away

Mirror this, I'll write your name
Leave a little message too
Eyes are shining diamond blue
Make heaven come closer to you
And when you finally come down
To realise what you hadn't found
If there's anything like solid ground
Don't let it go sound

Oh, my heart stitched love

Bem acordado nesta cidade violeta onde isso me derruba
Dói dizer que eu quero você comigo
Apenas envolto em meu quadro

Eu não posso me ajudar o momento que eu deixei ir
É quando eu acho que estou no controle (no controle)
Preciso de mais alguma coisa, o momento que eu deixei ir
É quando eu acho que estou no controle (no controle)
No controle (no controle), eu não posso me ajudar
O momento que eu deixei ir
É quando eu acho que estou no controle (estou no controle)

Em um labirinto da minha expectativa eu me sinto tão longe
Segurando nesses espaços vazios
Enquanto tento encontrar meu caminho
Porque eu estou em outro lugar cercado pela prateleira da cidade
Tentando apaziguar todos os meus desejos
Porque eu estou em outro lugar, acredite, eu estou fora de mim
Eu tenho tentado mudar

Eu não posso me ajudar o momento que eu deixei ir
É quando eu acho que estou no controle (no controle)
Preciso de mais alguma coisa, o momento que eu deixei ir
É quando eu acho que estou no controle (estou no controle)
Eu não posso me ajudar, o momento que eu deixei ir

And it's all been worth it
It's just hard sometimes in the heat of the moment

How the picture really sits
It's hard without a frame
To understand how big the picture is
Just how big the picture really is
And if it fits

If we'll ever figure some things out
The truth behind it all
What goes on behind some closed doors

I always let the days slip away
I should have been making up my mind
I never opened up, took it all in
And now I’m running out of time
Sometimes I dream about going back
Keeping all the things I left behind
But now I know you can’t change the past
Way too young to know the reason why

And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back

I feel the gravity pulling me
Faster than it ever has before
When I was seventeen, nicotine loving
Had me rush out of the door
I try to hold it back, take a breath
Looking at old pictures on the floor
But I hear everything telling me
""You don’t have the time, you gotta go""

And it all comes rushing back, rushing back

[Verse 1: Bliss]
When I wake in the morning I smile to myself like I'm thanking God
Shit, no more folks like, ""Jonathan, when you gonna grow up and get a job?"" (Uh-uh)
‘Cause I made that job, no Steve, that job's kept me hungry and foolish (Yup)
It's the coolest, I'm ‘a dive in like Kendrick and drink some rum in the pool bitch
Or beers on the roof, it's the workaholic in the magic sun
Till the esky is empty, shit, what's life if you ain't having fun?
So forget your age and those walls, I'm bursting through that maze
On top of the tour bus in a teen wolf mask surfing USA
And we got that baggage packed, happy gas, massive laughs, yes, I can dig it
So I joke like Tom when Josh, Baskin in these toys like a big kid
It's my habitat, I can't leave the trees like an Orangutan, I'm a
Running on air anchorman and I never land like bangarang.

[Chorus: Jake Stone]
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
You know what I'm saying, yo, enough of that shit, check that

[Verse 2: Eso]
Yo, I'm acting the fool, no shame, I came, I shat in the pool
Yeah, better pass that blunt, I'm ‘bout, ‘bout it, you can ask my Mum
She'll tell ya, I'm psycho mate, my ideas make your lightbulbs break
I make it look so damn easy when I rock that Borat mankini
Fuck what they say, you don't miss your chance to eat chocolate cake with your hands
You rock a bubble beard while you're taking a bath and where a simple fart still makes you laugh, like
Hahahaha, blurp blurp, hahaha
And then a big brown shark came, now I'm
On the stage acting up, yelling bombs away while I grab my nuts
Still living it like it's all a movie, still killing shit on Call of Duty
And I still think I can move like the Matrix, real shit, shrooming in Vegas
Or when I play with my dogs, even right now while I'm making this song
So how's about it, let's laugh till there's power outage
That's all I have to say, fuck them all, and don't act your age, I'm makin’ pancakes
[Chorus (Extended): Jake Stone]
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
Why don't you act, why don't you just act your age?
They're always saying to me, they're always saying:

Now I'm on a mission to find different ways to diss em
Leave the toilet seat glistening by the time I finish pissing, yuck!

Train my pet magpie to drop a massive shit up on your flannelette

Quick to drop in at your crib if you had a hot mum
Steady sitting on the couch pretending to watch TV
All the while staring down her blouse tryna cop a sneak peek

Yet pretty far from evil, but I'm hungry

I will not let them hold me back no more
I shoot I score I give my all
My future I am in control
(Yeah, yeah)
I am in control
(Yeah, yeah) I am in control
[Verse 2]
No matter young and old having dreams and goals
Take control and the fundamental roll
Negative roles it ain't good for da soul
Having that motive is good for us all
Keeping the ball running for the future
Got me feeling like a preacher (Ha, ha)
There’s nothing that you can’t achieve when you're a seeker (Say what?)
Keep on moving straight ahead
And be a icon like a pillar for the next gen (Okay, okay)

[Chorus]
They come they go but this I know
I will not let them hold me back no more
I shoot I score I give my all
My future I am in control
I am in control
(Who's in control?)
I am in control
I am in control (Oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Bridge]
When they tell you what you can and can’t do we like
No they won’t hold us back (What)
When you see people tryna break ya dreams and you know we like
No they won’t hold us back
When they say they know but you know they don’t we like
No they won’t hold us back (Whoop, whoop)
When you make it to the top and you cement your spot we like
No they won’t hold us back (Yeah yeah)
(All right)
[Chorus]
(Oh) They come they go but this I know
I will not let them hold me back no more
I shoot I score I give my all
My future I am in control (Ooh)
I am in control (Ooh)
(Yeah, yeah)
I am in control
I am in control

You're patient, you wait for me to say it
Static on the line
You're breaking, while these conversations play out in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see the look in your eye
I don't wanna be the bad guy
If this is gonna be the last night
Then, oh

[Chorus]
Please believe me
I don't wanna hurt you
But we're running out of time
And that's why I'm leaving
'Cause holding on's the worst of all the ways to say goodbye
All the ways to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Doubting, so I dance around it
But you can read my mind
You're falling, you don't believe me now
But I know you'll be fine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see the look in your eye
I don't wanna be the bad guy
If this is gonna be the last night
Then, oh
[Chorus]
Baby, please believe me
I don't wanna hurt you
But we're running out of time
And that's why I'm leaving
'Cause holding on's the worst of all the ways to say goodbye
All the ways to say goodbye
All the ways to say goodbye

Don't ask me to stay
Don't ask me to stay
Don't ask me to stay
Oh no

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kwame]
She tryna kick it with my best friend, yeah
He only calls her on a Friday
I swear I call her till the world end, yeah
She only love me when I'm dreaming
I know you're broke and need your bills paid, yeah
But that's some shit we'd pro'bly all say, yeah
But she still fucking with my best friend, ayy
God I wish it was that easy, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Obi Ill Terrors]
She taste like lemonade, but I've never sipped it
She sound like serenades, but I never listened
She feel like velvet sheets, all I got is blisters
She come over sometimes but she ain't my business
Plant these secrets, I'm prophesying my misdemeanours
Feeling choked inside but I don't know if she can see it
You see my kicks are getting cleaner and my drinks are getting cheaper
They almost free, 'cause people lie, they don't want either
It's safe to say we just some needles in a stack of hay
I'm always losing ways and staying down and blue for days
Wish she'd hit me up and pull me out this fucking haze
But this is purgatory, she ain't say a word to me
[Pre-Chorus 1: Obi Ill Terrors]
He was walking J's when he jaywalked
Tryna grab some papes from the corner store
She was off her face by the payphone
I know that she

[Chorus: Matt Corby and Kwame]
She tryna kick it with my best friend, yeah
He only calls her on a Friday
I swear I call her till the world end, yeah
She only love me when I'm dreaming
I know you're broke and need your bills paid, yeah
But that's some shit we'd bloody all say, yeah
But she still fucking with my best friend, ayy
God I wish it was that easy, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Marty Bugatti & Lil Dijon]
Make them plans and they fall out, TV dinner, no ball out
Cataracts, I went all out, UFO, not a light house
She pullin' up, I stay vacant, she want L and T, no bacon
I speak the truth, that's blatant, get operated, no patients, I can't
Stay out of trouble, I smuggle liquor in bubble tea
So orthodontist, the donnest man when I shift the teeth
A handyman, but a man is what he struggled to be
And stay relapsing, no relaxing for a boy like me
I know you really got it like C notes
(So easy) You live inside my mind depot
(So easy) The dark follows my ego
(So easy) They follow me, follow me home
[Pre-Chorus 2: Lil Dijon]
And I've seen your call
(So easy) You leave me wanting
No taste, no law
Lay it down on me, lay it down on me

[Chorus: Matt Corby & Kwame]
She tryna kick it with my best friend
She tryna kick it with my best friend
He only calls her on a Friday
He only calls her on a Friday
I swear I'll call her till the world end
I swear I'll call her, no, no
She only love me when I'm dreaming
She only love me when I'm dreaming
I know you're broke and need your bills paid
I know you're broke and need your bills paid
But that's some shit we'd pro'bly all say
Some shit we'd probably all say
But she still fucking with my best friend
She still fucking with my best friend
God I wish it was that easy, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Kwame]
Fell in love with shawty till I seen she fuck with Marty, damn
She said things were different till I seen her eat with Conor, man
Went to split the bill then realised that she had left with Bill
I heard she slept with Dom, but now she waking up in Quakers Hill1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

There’s a sky full of lights and none of them stars
But each white, silvery flicker’s a faithful reminder to us
Of a weight that’s in youth that makes a dick of us all
If it happened today, then it’s probably happened before
In a crowd unfamiliar, I just wanna touch a familiar face
And make friends at the parties I’ve feared the likes of an age
To be wanted with truth and make formidable love
See light in myself that I see inside everyone else I know

[Verse 2]
It’s not a lacking of spine, nor of physical pulse
It’s just a feeling of distance akin to a feeling of loss
Of love in the youth of my limited life
That passed in a violent and ritual screwing inside
And the years unfamiliar are made of increasingly digital days
And I am grieving the loss of myself with frightening malaise
When there’s weightness in youth and the sum of it’s small
Just stand in the darkness and laugh with your heel on its throat

[Chorus]
'Cause not everything means something, honey
So say the unsayable, say the most human of things
And if everything is temporary
I will bear the unbearable, terrible triteness of being
[Post-Chorus]
Alone in my house, frozen in time
But don’t get me wrong now, honey, I am trying

[Verse 3]
There’s a warmth in the eyes and a clearness of thought
When the deepest of sighs and the frankest of shadows are gone
We’re pushing a stone up a mountainous waste
And the lines at the store look like lines on a beautiful face
See, I’m not so assured
Nor unusually strong or outstandingly brave
I’m more just fumbling around in the dark for the bulk of my day
When there’s weight that’s in youth and the sum of it’s small
I will stand in the darkness and laugh with my heel on its throat

[Chorus]
And not everything means something, honey
So say the unsayable, say the most human of things
And if everything is temporary
I will bear the unbearable, terrible triteness of being

[Post-Chorus]
Alone in my house, frozen away
But don’t get me wrong now, honey, I’m okay

[Bridge]
Ah, cast me a line
Ah, honey, cast me a line
Won’t you fear me tonight?
Goddamn do you fear me tonight?
Ah, pass me a light
Ah, honey, pass me a light
Won’t you feel me tonight?
Goddamn do you feel me tonight?
[Chorus]
'Cause not everything means something, honey
So say the unsayable, say the most human of things
If everything is temporary
I will bear the unbearable, terrible triteness of being5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Way back in adolescence, I learnt one simple lesson
First impressions last and showing love don't take much effort
I fanned out on an idol, got brushed and still won't forget it
So these days when I see artists on that too cool shit my message to 'em's like
All due respect here there's no respect due
So fuck you, fuck you, man
Some artists on that high horse like they just put Thriller out
Some artist care about music less than Instagram accounts
They told me drink that Kool-Aid, oh, hell nah, I spit that out
And as much as I would love to give the benefit of doubt
I'm saying. nah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All due respect here, there's no respect due
If you in it for the status I dedicate this to you, I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
Fuck you and you and you
And you, you're cool, fuck you and I'm outta here
Fuck you and you and you
And you, you're cool, but fuck you and I'm outta here
All due respect here, there's no respect due
So fuck you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, let's flip that to the wild shit people say to get attention
You know the reason mama said don't read no comment sections
I'd hit back but whenever I tell them kiss my bare arse
My two cents got me emptying my wallet in a swear jar
Still all due respect here, there's no respect due
So fuck you, oh my bad
Pardon my french (putain) big no-no, wash my mouth out with soap, oh
You don't like it, by all means, yo, hit my socials, let me know so
Hold breathe till I reply then die waitin' then have your folks post
Funeral details online so I can come take Snapchat photos, man
[Pre-Chorus 2]
All due respect here, there's no respect due
If you spend all day online just cutting down what people do my words to you are

[Chorus]
Fuck you and you and you
And you, you're cool, but fuck you and I'm outta here
Fuck you and you and you
And you, you're cool, ah, fuck you and I'm outta here
All due respect here, there's no respect due
So fuck you

[Bridge]
ONETWO, ONETWO
Now ladies and gentleman I know I'm not perfect, hell
I'm probably guilty of this shit myself
But, ah, I tried, oh, I try not to put myself above nobody
Or get my kicks kicking someone else, yeah
But if you tired of the bullshit people throw your way
I've got this one little phrase that helps, it goes

[Chorus]
Fuck you and you and you
And you, you're cool, fuck you and I'm outta here
Fuck you and you and you
And you, you're cool, fuck you and I'm outta here
All due respect here, there's no respect due
So fuck you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Late at night on a closed piano lid
She circles past, she fills your glass
But she doesn't recognise the song
Once in a lifetime she says
The waking life stitched together in your head
Well, what if it's only worth
The bundle of nerves it's written on?
And i don't need these arms anymore
I don't need this heart now, to love
I don't need this skin and bone at all
There's a way you've alwys known her
Telephone between her cheek and her shoulder
And eyes like crystal balls
That just won't shut up about the future of the future
And ramona was a waitress
All but made of information
In a bar under the third bridge
She says she's looking forward to living forever
When i won't need these arms anymore
When i won't need this heart now to love
And i won't need this skin and bone at all
At all...
And ramona was a waitress...1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
