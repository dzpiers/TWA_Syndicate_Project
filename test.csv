[Verse 1]
Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gather 'round the parlour talking
That's when Billy would take me walking
Through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows, to my surprise

[Chorus]
The only one who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
The only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Yes he was (Hallelujah)
Yeah, he was (Hallelujah)
Ohh, he was (Ohh Hallelujah)

[Verse 2]
Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talking to me
He keeps 'n tellin' me ""Everything is all right"" (Sock it to me)
Baby baby ""Everything is all right""
(Ohh Sock it to me)
Can I sneak away again tonight now

[Chorus]
The only one who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
I tell you that the only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Yes he was (Hallelujah)
Yeah, he was (Hallelujah)
Ohh, he was (Haaaa)

[Verse 3]
Hmmmm
How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealing kisses from me on the sly
Taking time to make time
Telling me that he's all mine
Learning from each other's knowing
Looking to see how much we're growing

[Chorus]
The only boy who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
I tell you that the only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Ohh, yes he was (Hallelujah)
Yeah, he was (Hallelujah)
Ohh, he was (Ohh Hallelujah)
Hallelujah
(Son of a preacher man, Hallelujah)
Hallelujah for the son, now yeah

Long as I remember, the rain been coming down
Clouds of mystery pouring, confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages, trying to find the sun

I went down Virginia, seeking shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals, wrapped in golden chains

[Chorus]
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

[Verse 3]
Heard the singers playing, how we cheered for more
The crowd had rushed together, trying to keep warm
Still the rain kept pouring, falling on my ears

[Chorus]
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me

You took me from the shelter of my mother
I had never known or loved any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me

Ohh

Don't you know that I wait
In the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me

17,I'll Never Fall in Love Again,I'll Never Fall In Love Again,Dionne Warwick,1970,174840,57,"

[Verse 1]
What do you get when you fall in love?
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
That's what you get for all your trouble
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

[Verse 2]
What do you get when you kiss a guy?
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
After you do, he'll never phone ya
I'll never fall in love again
Don't you know that I'll never fall in love again

[Bridge]
Don't tell me what's it all about
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of those chains, those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

[Verse 3]
What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lots of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
No, no, I'll never fall in love again

[Bridge]
I'm out of those chains, those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you

[Verse 4]
What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lots of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
Don't you know that I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

18,Patches,Patches,Clarence Carter,1970,193826,46,"

I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me ""Patches""
Papa used to tease me about it
'Course deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the time got bad

The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said
He said:

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""

Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was daddy's strictest rule

So every morning fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home

But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said:

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through

'Cause every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me

Every night I heard my mama pray:
""Lord, give him strength to make another day""

Though years have passed and all the kids have grown
The angels took mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin':

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""

Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin':

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""

I could still hear papa when he's saying:

""Patches, I'm depending on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""

21,Ain't No Mountain High Enough,Diamond Diana: The Legacy Collection,Diana Ross,2017-11-17,215200,56,"

[Verse 1:]
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry
You see, my love is alive
It's like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please, my darling, let it be me

[Verse 2:]
I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words

[Bridge:]
No wind, (no wind) no rain, (no rain)
Nor winter's cold
Can stop me, babe (oh, babe) baby (baby)
If you're my goal

No wind, no rain
Can stop
If you want to go

[Verse 3:]
I know, I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
You'll always have me

And if you should miss my love
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close, or the lips
That used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free

[Refrain 1:]
Ain't no mountain high enough, aah
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you

[Refrain 2:]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you

[Refrain 3:]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (one more time)
Ain't no river wide enough (say it again)
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you
Nothing in this world

Now if you load your rifle right
And if you fix your bayonet so
And if you kill that man, my friend

No you won't believe in If anymore

Seventy-three men sailed up from the San Francisco Bay
Rolled off of their ship, and here's what they had to say
""We're callin' everyone to ride along to another shore
We can laugh our lives away and be free once more""

But no one heard them callin', no one came at all
Cause they were too busy watchin' those old raindrops fall
As a storm was blowin' out on the peaceful sea
Seventy-three men sailed off to history

Ride, captain ride upon your mystery ship
Be amazed at the friends you have here on your trip
Ride captain ride upon your mystery ship
On your way to a world that others might have missed

[Verse 1]
Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there tryin’ to fool the public
But when it comes down to foolin’ you
Now, honey, that's quite a different subject
But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Really I'm sad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)
Oh, sadder than sad

You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad

But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around

Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I’ve tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Decided to go
(Why did you go?)
Oh, I need you so
(I need you so)

But ain't too much sadder than

When there's no one around

Just like Pagliacci did (The great pretender)
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye (The great pretender)
But in my lonely room, I cry

When there's no one around

Now if there's a smile on my face (Tears of clown)
Don't let my glad expression (Tears of a clown)

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worryin' me

It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head

Well, I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, ""tell me, where are you going?""
This he told me

Said, ""I'm going down to Yasgur's Farm
Gonna join in a rock and roll band
Got to get back to the land
And set my soul free""

We are stardust, we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

Well, then can I walk beside you?
I have come to lose the smog
And I feel myself a cog
In somethin' turning

And maybe it's the time of year
Yes, and maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life is for learning

We are stardust, we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

We are stardust, we are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere was a song
And a celebration

And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust, we are golden
We are caught in the devil's bargain
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

34,Snowbird,This Way Is My Way,Anne Murray,1998-01-01,134226,48,"

[Verse 1]
Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting for its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring

[Verse 2]
When I was young my heart was young then, too
Anything that it would tell me, that's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's the thing that I can't win

[Chorus]
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

[Verse 3]
The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay
So, little snowbird, take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow

[Chorus]
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

[Outro]
Yeah, if I could I know that I would
Fl-y-y-y-y away with you

36,Question,A Question Of Balance,The Moody Blues,1970-08-07,344226,50,"

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war

'Cause when we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution
That is burning in its greed

(ahhhh ahh ah)
(ahhhh ahh ah)
Ahhhh ahh ah

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
Because the truth is hard to swallow
That's what the wall of love is for

It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way that you mean it
When you tell me what will be

And when you stop and think about it
You won't believe it's true
That all the love you've been giving
Has all been meant for you

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me through

Between the silence of the mountains
And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me

But in the grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead and the sleeping
And the road that I must choose

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me to
The land that I once knew
To learn as we grow old
The secrets of our souls

It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way you really mean it
When you tell me what will be

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war

When we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution
That is burning in it's greed
(ahhhh ahh ah)
(ahhhh ahh ah)
Ahhhh ahh ah

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?

She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter 'cause it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and then she goes

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...

Don't ask her why she needs to be so free
She 's gonna tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...

There's no time to lose, I heard her say
You got to catch your dreams before they runaway
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you, might will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...

Oh, darling
I'm so lonely without you
Can't sleep at night
Always thinking about you

But if I had the
Chance to start all over
I would be wishing today
On a four leaf clover

And leaving would be
The last thing on my mind
If I could turn back
The hands of time

(If I could turn back
The hands of time) oh, baby
(If I could turn back
The hands of time)

Oh, darling
I can't hold out much longer
For the pain is getting deep
Oh, the hurt keeps getting stronger

But if I had just one more try
I would be yours alone
Until the day I die

And we would
Have a love so divine
If I could turn back
The hands of time

(If I could turn back
The hands of time) oh, baby
(If I could turn back
The hands of time)

Remember, girl
That I love you

Oh, darling, please
Please let me come back home
Your love has been
So good to me, baby
And I just realized
Without it, I can't go on

Cause you're the other half
That makes my life complete
If I had one more chance
We'd have a love so sweet

And leaving would be
The last thing on my mind
If I could turn back
The hands of time

41,Spill The Wine,The Best of Eric Burdon & War,Eric Burdon,1970,246200,36,"

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie
But there I was
I was taken to a place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high by the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of
Every kind of girl
There was long ones, tall ones, short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said...

Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl


I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said

Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl

It's on girl, all you gotta do is spill that wine
Spill that wine, let me feel, let me feel hot, yeah! yeah!
Spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine
Spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine
Take that pearl!

Past the pain
I find myself
Calling out to you
Another baby born
Another life scorn, ahh
The village must come
To work together, ahh
Ahh, too many [?]
[?] babies are suffering
Look where we are, it’s time to
Pull and be a blessing
Oh be a blessing

I find myself
Past the pain
Hoping the clouds
So I can see the sun
Now that I have you
Now that we have each other
Now that we have we
Now that we have us
Now that we have we, build

Trapped in the skin and then
Hear the voices calling
Have I seen past
Past the pain

Let me know if you need something
I’ll let you know that too
This is what we’ve got to do

To take my time
Take time to let you know
My favorite thing
Is to shut it all down
To find your hand

To think I’m weak

People moving out
People moving in
Why, because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you just can't hide

An eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on

Well, the only person talking about loving thy brother is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learning but the teacher
Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration, aggravation, humiliation
Obligation to our nation

Ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey

The sales of pills are at an all time high
Young folks walk with their heads in the sky
The cities aflame in the summertime
And oh the beat goes on

Evolution, revolution, gun control, sound of soul-shooting rockets to the moon
Kids growing up too soon
Politicians say, ""More taxes will solve everything,""
And the band played on

So, round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed nobody knows

Oh, Great Googamooga
Can't you hear me talking to you
Just a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey

Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live
Is on an Indian reservation
The band played on

Eve of destruction, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors, mod clothes in demand
Population out of hand, suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, ""End the war!""
And the band played on

Great Googamooga
Can't you hear me talking to you
Just a Ball Of Confusion
