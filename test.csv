See I really dig your tone
Did you get the telepathic text message that I sent to your phone?
We're both barely grown
But I know what I like
Say the word and it's on
Can't get you out my head
The deepest shade of red
Sometimes the coolest blue
Or a mix of the two
Your aura match mine
So I had to choose you
My love kaleidoscope
Come and let me change your view

You always bring the sunshine
We be up to the sunrise
Prettiest color seen by my eyes
With a stroke of dedication
A little bit of patience
You'll see the bigger picture that we painting
Don't turn down your brightness
I love your saturation
Fill up your cup
Can we get a little faded
To be next to you is a moment I savor
I want this forever
So don't leave me hanging

I don't like the flavor, I don't like the taste
Searching for nirvana
Something that'll take it all away from me

Burning in the lava

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

[Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
[Verse 2: SZA, Jacob Collier]
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe

Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"" (It's urgent)

Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind
[Verse 3: SZA]
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

[Verse 1: V, Jung Kook]
그럴 수만 있다면 물어보고 싶었어
그때 왜 그랬는지 왜 날 내쫓았는지
어떤 이름도 없이 여전히 널 맴도네
작별이 무색해 그 변함없는 색채

[Verse 2: RM]
나에겐 이름이 없구나
나도 너의 별이었는데
넌 빛이라서 좋겠다
난 그런 널 받을 뿐인데
무너진 왕성에
남은 명이 뭔 의미가 있어
죽을 때까지 받겠지
니 무더운 시선
아직 난 널 돌고 변한 건 없지만
사랑에 이름이 없다면
모든 게 변한 거야
넌 정말로 Eris를 찾아낸 걸까
말해 내가 저 달보다 못한 게 뭐야
Us는 u의 복수형일 뿐
어쩌면 거기 처음부터 난 없었던 거야
언젠가 너도 이 말을 이해하겠지
나의 계절은 언제나 너였어
내 차가운 심장은 영하 248도
니가 날 지운 그 날 멈췄어

어제와는 그리 다를 건 없네 ay
똑같은 일상 속에 딱 너만 없네 ay
분명 어제까지는 함께였는데 ay
무서울 정도로 똑같은 하루 속엔 딱 너만 없네
솔직히 말해 니가 없던 일년쯤
덤덤했지 흔히 말하는 미련도
없던 지난 날 이젠 깜빡
니 향기 따윈 기억도 안나 잠깐
근데 어디선가 맡아봤던 향순데 ay
기억이 어렴풋이 피어날 즘에 ay
저기 저기 고개를 돌려보니
환하게 웃으며 다가오는 니 옆엔 그...
(안녕?) 안녕
어떻게 지내? 나는 뭐 잘 지내
왠지 터질듯한 내 심장과는 달리
이 순간 온도는 영하 248

Leave her shocked like Zatch Bell, her lights out

Shawty wanna spend the night out (night out)
I said, I just might catch you later no doubt
Hop up in my Tesla, I'm in route
Leave her shocked like Zatch Bell, her lights out

[Verse]
In the club, let's just run it up
By the way she talkin’ I think shawty fell in love
Is she really plotting, or just falling for the drugs
If I'm wrong I’ll say I'm sorry
My true thoughts are so unjust
No trust, like Arashi
I can't tell I hurt your soul, just like Yukari
Why the hell I messed things up before it started
Switching up the setting real fast, let's just dead this party

All your haunting pain, take it all away
From your eyes okay, tonight!
Let’s be on our way, to a sacred place
This will be our paradise
Way beyond the planes, where the angels play
That where shorty came, no lie
Every night I pray, that you have to stay
'Cause you are my only light

[Outro]
What's going on? Why are you ignoring me?
Can't really say, perhaps it's 'cause I'm jealous
What?
Would you mind giving me some space, I'm feeling very rooted right now1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Oh yeah, top of the morning, ladies and gentlemen
We flyin' above the sky
It's thirty thousand feet in the air right now
Last Year Was Weird
LYWW Radio, let's go

[Chorus]
Days fly by witnessed
But you're caught up in the minute
Mind your own business (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mind your own
Days fly by witnessed
But you're caught up in the minute
Mind your own business (Ayy)
Mind your own

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm really on that private
Flow nice, but I'm never autopilot
Niggas tryna get accustomed to my climate
Finest tarot card, I'm the highest
Flightless birds running like a virus
You can't ride with me, solo ride pirate
And my ego bigger than the Mack truck
Tryna act tough, you might have to cut the banter
And give me five feet stat, nigga, back up
Gettin' way too close with that bad luck
Diamonds are the only ones that match up
And mad ones in my crew tryna pass up
I'm in my element, less is relevant, on a regimen
To my excellence, bitch, do not disturb
Say it once, not twice or I pick up the nerve
I'ma say it one time, better do not disturb
I'ma raise my fees, drive the Benz with the skrrt
Make a nigga wanna hit it but it do not occur
Make a rude bitch mad 'cause my ice got the brr
And your friends pullin' up 'cause my M's lookin' up
Yeah, young, reckless, you can't test it
My game bigger 'cause I'm built like Tetris
New thing, got a groove like Elvis
Going too ham, yeah, don't touch my precious
[Chorus]
Days fly by witnessed
But you're caught up in the minute
Mind your own business
Mind your own
Days fly by witnessed
But you're caught up in the minute
Mind your own business
Mind your own

[Post-Chorus]
Do you mind?
We don't have no reasons to rewind
Give me two feet, we're out of time
We don't have no reasons to rewind
Mind your own (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I been blessed by the gods (Yeah)
Divine my spirit, I'm against all the odds
But I keep winning 'cause I pledge what I say
Yeah, I do what I say, you can leave me alone
Been a wallflower but I lead by my own
Cleared though, chakra, left my demons at home
Got a LV bag with a 40 tag
I be way too clean, you can't jack my swag
Nigga wanna hate, well, that's way too bad
Too much on my plate that I can't compromise
If you can't keep the rhythm, gotta take what you have
'Cause everybody works, I'ma take all my time
If you ain't know know, now you best know now
The one-one, mighty and the best know-how
On to the next, never do slow down
Yeah, they wanna peep, but they can't solve mine
[Bridge]
I didn't need a present
Didn't you learn your lesson?
Why did you think that I would let you in?
No, I don't roll that way
I didn't need a present
Didn't you learn your lesson?
Why did you think that I would let you in?
No, I don't roll that way

[Chorus]
Days fly by witnessed
But you're caught up in the minute
Mind your own business
Mind your own
Days fly by witnessed
But you're caught up in the minute
Mind your own business
Mind your own

[Post-Chorus]
Do you mind?
We don't have no reasons to rewind
Give me two feet, we're out of time
We don't have no reasons to rewind
Mind your own
Do you mind?
We don't have no reasons to rewind
Give me two feet, we're out of time
We don't have no reasons to rewind

I'm afraid to go outside
So many people rule my mind
I can't escape, where is the line?
Chained ourselves to overdrive

It's nice out

Creeping round corners
I don't feel like myself
Studying your movements
It's a carousel
And I can confirm that you mean what you say
And I'm pretty sure that it's better that way

[Pre-Chorus: Kindora]
Why can't I trust in you?
Am I slipping up over you?
If it really turned to be the way that I think
How bad could it be?
If it really turned to be the way that I think
How bad could it be?

[Chorus: Kindora]
I dont wanna make you think you get away with anything
And I know that we could go for
Round and round like 123
And I gotta question myself
Is it coming?
Possibly
And I gotta wonder
Am I sleeping with the enemy?
I dont wanna make you think you get away with anything
And I know that we could go for
Round and round like 123
And I gotta question myself
Is it coming?
Possibly
And I gotta wonder
Am I sleeping with the enemy?
[Verse 2: bbymutha]
Can't afford to get played again
Bitches wanna be my friend
I don't know what to tell them
I can smell'em
Niggas hard to trust
You dont know me, bitch
I can't be touched
I'm really to fed up
Why you got your eye on me?
I gotta question what the fuck they see
I gotta question every move they make
And breathe they take
Lucifer was beautiful
But that doesn't mean he wasn't a snake
Bitch

[Pre-Chorus: Kindora]
Why can't I trust in you?
Am I slipping up over you?
If it really turned to be the way that I think
How bad could it be?
If it really turned to be the way that I think
How bad could it be?

I can't even tell if I'm making this up
Impossible to assume what you want
I'm watching my back like I got nothing left
I give you all I got
Wish I knew what was next

[Pre-Chorus: Kindora]
Why can't I trust in you?
Am I slipping up over you?
If it really turned to be the way that I think
How bad could it be?
If it really turned to be the way that I think

But it's fun to think we could
