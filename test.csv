0,Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,The Best Of The Platters,The Platters,1995-01-01,157293,0,"

They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies

Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Smoke gets in your eyes!

[Verse 1]
Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you

[Verse 2]
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

You give your hand to me

A chance that you might love me too

And then you say, ""Goodbye""
And I watched you walk away
Beside the lucky guy

4,You Belong To Me,The Magic Of Jo Stafford,Jo Stafford,2001-01-01,192560,53,"

See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me

See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
Watch the jungle when it's wet with rain
But remember darling, till you're home again
You belong to me

I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me

I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be

So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me

Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be

So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always---let--it—be--me

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Now Mamma Dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
That charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...

Come on and dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
That charm(s) about you
Will carry me through...

7,Stardust,Love Is The Thing,Nat King Cole,1957-08-01,195573,50,"

[Verse 1]
And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

[Verse 2]
Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairytale
A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

Happy together, unhappy together

So lucky to be loving you

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?

Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm? Are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?

On a day like today
We passed the time away
Writing love letters in the sand

How you laughed when I cried
Each time I saw the tide
Take our love letters from the sand

You made a vow that you would ever be true
But somehow that vow meant nothing to you

Now my broken heart aches
With every wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand

Now my broken heart aches
With every wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand

Knowing things could change

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods...

[ANNIE (spoken)]
Jack, hurry up! Come on!

[JACK (spoken)]
Just a second. Sugar maple...

[MORGAN (sung)]
On a day just like any other

[ANNIE]
What're you doing?

[JACK]
Making notes. Rough bark...

[MORGAN]
In the woods not very far from home

[ANNIE]
Jack! I'm a monster!

[JACK]
Star-shaped leaves...

[MORGAN]
As they walk, a sister and brother...

[ANNIE]
Grrrrrr!!!

[JACK]
Annie, cut it out!

[ANNIE]
Oh, come on, Jack! Play with me!

[MORGAN]
Argue

[JACK]
No! I'm too old to play pretend

[ANNIE]
No you're not!

[JACK]
Yes I am!

[ANNIE]
Are not!

[JACK]
Am too!

[MORGAN]
But today what they say doesn't matter

[ANNIE]
Jack, it's not pretend! I'm a monster!

[MORGAN]
For today in the woods they're not alone

Jack, look!

[JACK]
Annie, stop!

[MORGAN]
Today at the top of a ladder

[ANNIE]
No, really! Look!

[JACK]
Where?

[ANNIE]
Over there!

Oh, man!

[MORGAN]
There's a magic place where wishes can come true

How far can you see

[ANNIE]
I'm climbing up!

[JACK]
Annie, don't! We don't know who it belongs to!

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[JACK]
Annie!

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
What?

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[ANNIE]
It's full of books!

[JACK]
Really?

[ANNIE]
Yes! Look!

[MORGAN]
When you venture outside your window

[ANNIE]
Books about knights! Ninjas! And...oh, wow!

[JACK]
What?

[ANNIE]
Dinosaurs!

[JACK]
Hold on, I'm coming up!

[ANNIE (sung)
Books about faraway places
Pictures of wondrous sights to see

[MORGAN]
To go there, all that it takes is wishing

[ANNIE (spoken)]
See?

[MORGAN]
A wish to have an adventure

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[MORGAN]
A wish from the top of a tree

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[MORGAN]
A wish to be there -- and then you're flying

How far can you see

[JACK]
Look at that! Polar bears!

Awwww...

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

Pyramids!

Pilgrims!

Planets!

When you venture outside your window

Prehistoric pterodactyls!

What?

Dinosaurs!

[ANNIE]
Oh, right

[JACK]
Oh, man. This is amazing. I really wish we could go there...

(The Tree House spins)

[JACK and ANNIE]
AIEEEEEEE!!!

[ANNIE]
What happened?

[JACK]
I...I don't know

[ANNIE]
Where are we?

[JACK]
It...it looks like the picture in the book

[ANNIE]
Yeah, *exactly* like it

[JACK]
There's the palm tree...

[ANNIE]
There's the volcano...

[JACK and ANNIE]
AND THERE'S THE DINOSAURS!!!

Come on, I want to pet a dinosaur!

How're we going to get home?

[ANNIE]
We can worry about that later! Come on!

Annie, wait! I'm coming!

That day, Jack and Annie discovered that the Tree House is magic -- and later they found out that it belongs to me, Morgan le Fay, of Camelot. Since that first day in the woods, they have had many wondrous adventures...and we have become friends...

[ANNIE]
Morgan! Hi!

[MORGAN]
Welcome back! Did you have fun?

[JACK]
Yep. We did

[ANNIE]
And look what we brought you!

[JACK]
It's a mango! From a rainforest!

[ANNIE]
And a moonstone! From a real ninja!

[JACK]
And look! A mammoth bone from the Ice Age!

[ANNIE]
This is the best summer we've ever had!

[JACK and ANNIE (sung)]
We saw dinosaurs before dark

[JACK]
A knight at dawn

[ANNIE]
We only had to make a wish

[JACK]
And whoosh! We were gone!
To visit mummies in the morning

[ANNIE]
Sail with pirates past noon

[JACK and ANNIE]
We're going out for a minute, Mom
We'll be home soon!

[JACK]
After a night of ninjas
Back in old Japan

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[ANNIE]
Or an afternoon on the Amazon

[JACK]
With crocodiles and monkeys and a big python!

[ANNIE]
Yikes!

[JACK]
We might set out through the ice and snow

[ANNIE]
To see the sun set on a sabertooth
A million years ago

[JACK and ANNIE]
Or maybe even travel
Far above the world we know
Arrive at midnight on the moon
And watch the earth revolve below!

In the Tree House there's no limit

25,April Love,Pat Boone's Greatest Hits (Reissue),Pat Boone,1962-08-01,161200,48,"

April love is for the very young
Every star's a wishing star that shines for you
April love is all the seven wonders
One little kiss can tell you this is true

Sometimes an April day will suddenly bring showers
Rain to grow the flowers for her first bouquet
But April love can slip right through your fingers
So if she's the one, don't let her run away

Sometimes an April day will suddenly bring showers
Rain to grow the flowers for her first bouquet

Our guardian star lost all his glow
The day that I lost you
He lost all his glitter the day you said no
And his silver turned to blue

Like him, I am doubtful
That your love is true
But if you decide to call on me
Ask for Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you love me
Then prove it by going out on the sly
Proving your love isn't true
Call me Mr. Blue

I'm Mr. Blue
When you say you're sorry
Then turn around, heading for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue

I stay at home at night
Right by the phone at night
But you won't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mr

I won't tell you
While you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too

But I'm painting it blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue

[Verse]
Pretend you're happy when you're blue
It isn't very hard to do
And you'll find happiness without an end
Whenever you pretend
Remember, anyone can dream
And nothing's as bad as it may seem
The little things you haven't got could be a lot if you pretend

[Bridge]
You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes, she'll be there
You'll never be alone

[Verse 2]
And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend

And take the brightest stars up in the skies
And place them in her eyes for me

Venus, goddess of love that you are

[Intro: Coolio]
Greeting earthlings
We have now taken over your radio

[Chorus: Method Man]
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Going straight to the Hole, you ain't got no game
I'm breaking ya out the frame, coming through like a train
Looking to take over the whole world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew taking over control
You can't get none of this, we're running this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunning this
Get out the lane, I'm coming through
And if you don't wanna move I'm coming right through you

[Verse 2: Coolio]
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust, now your whole crew is dust
Coming through my area, I'ma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your stream scene
It's like showdown on the rango tell me who wanna tangle
With the ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real & Method Man]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (before)

[Chorus: Method Man]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Insane like a runaway train, I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed—ah—, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange megalomaniacal
Monster in the game and I got my eye on you
Dead shot aim as free throws keep coming
Down like rain, you feeling me, I'm feeling you
The Monstar again, I'm telling you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do, my tactics
Is unsportsmanlike conduct, you better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift?
You get stripped by Ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer
Danger you're dealing with official hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Uh, lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the Rim, finessing and moves is animated
Once I get to balling, I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is getting money
When clicks get to bugging, I'm snatching up their bunnies
Uh, every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shake you down
This is my planet, I'm 'bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness? (No doubt, uh)
My cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money or in it for the love
M.J.? 23 ways to make a pay
Lounging in the mothership back around my way, uh
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole
Am I getting lyrical? Daddy, I think so
Monstar dropping flavor fluid so drink slow

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real, Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (yeah, run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (ah, hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war, turn the music up, please!)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (ah, yah, before)

[Chorus: Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (we hit 'em high, high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (you hit 'em low, low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (we hit 'em high, high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (you hit 'em low, low)

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, God bless, pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed balling on the fast break just like the pony express
I'm gon' mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game, you and your team
Just need to back off, get off my block, give me the ball
I said it's my rock, I'm starting a line-up by getting y'all
To bring the livestock (hah), throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through, tell me what you really gon' do?
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams
Like crash cars, who do they be? They be the Monstars! (Whatchu talkin' about?!)

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real, Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore
(what is she talking about? hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (before)

[Chorus: Method Man]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)

30,Prisoner Of Love,Remember When?,The Platters,1959-01-01,184373,44,"

Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty
Why should I be a lone soul?
Why can't I be my own soul?
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner of love
For one command I stand and wait now
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another for I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love, love

Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Trying to find somebody to teach me tonight

We'll start with the A B C of it
Then we'll roll down to the X Y Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Oh, come on and teach me tonight

Well the sky's a blackboard (and I don't mean jungle) high above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Yeah, yeah teach me tonight

Well the sky's a blackboard, high above you
And if an astronaut zooms by
I'll reach and grab him real fast
Then write I love you a thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
I know you're wondering how I switched that key, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me
Teach me
Come on
And teach me tonight

I believe for every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Some one will come to show the way
I believe, I believe

I believe above the storm the smallest prayer
Will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
I believe, I believe

I believe the lord in heaven he is my guide
My sins he'll hide
I believe on calvary that jesus died
That pierced side
I believe in death we'll part to rise again
And meet in heaven to that loud amen
Then I know why, I believe

Everyday words seem to turn into love songs

Her shores will always be home to me

The heaven on high

Sun comes down with a burning glow
Mingles my sweat with the earth below

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters
Your shining sand

I see woman on bended knee
Cutting cane for her family
I see man at the waterside
Casting nets at the surging tide

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand

I'm climbing up!

[JACK]
Annie, don't! We don't know who it belongs to!

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[JACK]
Annie!

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
What?

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[ANNIE]
It's full of books!

[JACK]
Really?

[ANNIE]
Yes! Look!

[MORGAN]
When you venture outside your window

[ANNIE]
Books about knights! Ninjas! And...oh, wow!

[JACK]
What?

[ANNIE]
Dinosaurs!

[JACK]
Hold on, I'm coming up!

[ANNIE (sung)
Books about faraway places
Pictures of wondrous sights to see

[MORGAN]
To go there, all that it takes is wishing

[ANNIE (spoken)]
See?

[MORGAN]
A wish to have an adventure

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[MORGAN]
A wish from the top of a tree

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[MORGAN]
A wish to be there -- and then you're flying

[JACK]
I've never seen so many books in my life!

[MORGAN]
How far can you see

[JACK]
Look at that! Polar bears!

[ANNIE]
Awwww...

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[ANNIE]
And look at this one! It's all about pirates!

[JACK]
Let me see that!

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[JACK]
Pyramids!

[ANNIE]
Pilgrims!

[JACK]
Planets!

[MORGAN]
When you venture outside your window

[JACK]
Prehistoric pterodactyls!

[ANNIE]
What?

[JACK]
Dinosaurs!

[ANNIE]
Oh, right

[JACK]
Oh, man. This is amazing. I really wish we could go there...

(The Tree House spins)

[JACK and ANNIE]
AIEEEEEEE!!!

[ANNIE]
What happened?

[JACK]
I...I don't know

[ANNIE]
Where are we?

[JACK]
It...it looks like the picture in the book

[ANNIE]
Yeah, *exactly* like it

[JACK]
There's the palm tree...

[ANNIE]
There's the volcano...

[JACK and ANNIE]
AND THERE'S THE DINOSAURS!!!

[ANNIE]
Let's go!

[JACK]
Annie, wait!

[ANNIE]
Come on, I want to pet a dinosaur!

[JACK]
How're we going to get home?

[ANNIE]
We can worry about that later! Come on!

[JACK]
Annie, wait! I'm coming!

[MORGAN (spoken)]
That day, Jack and Annie discovered that the Tree House is magic -- and later they found out that it belongs to me, Morgan le Fay, of Camelot. Since that first day in the woods, they have had many wondrous adventures...and we have become friends...

[ANNIE]
Morgan! Hi!

[MORGAN]
Welcome back! Did you have fun?

[JACK]
Yep. We did

[ANNIE]
And look what we brought you!

[JACK]
It's a mango! From a rainforest!

[ANNIE]
And a moonstone! From a real ninja!

[JACK]
And look! A mammoth bone from the Ice Age!

[ANNIE]
This is the best summer we've ever had!

[JACK and ANNIE (sung)]
We saw dinosaurs before dark

[JACK]
A knight at dawn

[ANNIE]
We only had to make a wish

[JACK]
And whoosh! We were gone!
To visit mummies in the morning

[ANNIE]
Sail with pirates past noon

[JACK and ANNIE]
We're going out for a minute, Mom
We'll be home soon!

[JACK]
After a night of ninjas
Back in old Japan

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[ANNIE]
Or an afternoon on the Amazon

[JACK]
With crocodiles and monkeys and a big python!

[ANNIE]
Yikes!

[JACK]
We might set out through the ice and snow

[ANNIE]
To see the sun set on a sabertooth
A million years ago

[JACK and ANNIE]
Or maybe even travel
Far above the world we know
Arrive at midnight on the moon
And watch the earth revolve below!

In the Tree House there's no limit
If we wish it when we're in it
And the magic starts to spin it
There's no limit, just no limit
There's no limit to the places we can go!

[MORGAN (sung)]
How far can you see

[ANNIE]
My brother and me

[JACK]
My sister and me

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[ANNIE]
From the top of a tree?

[JACK]
From the top of a tree?

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[ANNIE]
So many places to go

[JACK]
So many places to go

[MORGAN, JACK, and ANNIE]
When you venture outside your window

[JACK (spoken)]
Oh, man! Remember riding the dolphins?

[ANNIE (spoken)]
Yeah! And visiting the tigers, and the kangaroos...

[JACK]
And the gorillas!

[ANNIE]
Awwww...I loved the gorillas!

[JACK]
Sailing on the Titanic!

[ANNIE]
That was really scary

[JACK]
The ghost town was scary, too

[ANNIE]
Yeah, and the twister, and the earthquake, and the volcano...

[JACK]
Yep. All scary

[ANNIE]
It was fun meeting Shakespeare, tough. And George Washington

[JACK]
And the pilgrims. And the Dragon King

[ANNIE]
And Clara Barton. And King Arthur

[MORGAN]
How far can you see

[JACK]
Yeah. King Arthur

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[ANNIE]
What was the very most fun for you?

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[JACK]
Mmmm... I think I'd have to say Hawaii

[ANNIE]
Yeah, Hawaii was great

[MORGAN]
When you venture outside your window

[ANNIE]
We sure have been to a lot of places

[JACK]
Yep. I can't wait to find out where we'll go next...

46,Walkin' After Midnight,Golden Hits Collection,Patsy Cline,2006,154026,48,"

[Verse 1]
I go out walking after midnight
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of saying, I love you
I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you

[Chorus]
I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

[Verse 2]
I go out walking after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be somewhere walking
After midnight searching for me

[Chorus]
I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

[Outro]
I'm out walking after midnight, out in the starlight
Just hoping maybe you're somewhere
Walking after midnight, searching for me

What a difference a day made
Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain

My yesterday was blue dear
Today I'm a part of you dear
My lonely nights are through dear
Since you said you were mine

Lord, what a difference a day made
Theres a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss;
That thrilling kiss

It's heaven when you
Find romance on your menu
What a difference a day made
And the difference is you

One kiss, one little sigh
That's all you gave me
When you said goodbye
But someday, baby
Someday, darlin'

Long gone is your caress
And with it all my happiness

You're gonna miss me

But I won't be there to comfort you
You'll turn on the light

Can chase away your blues

I'm not the only one
Whose heart will burn
'Cause someday, baby
Someday darlin'
You're gonna miss me
Miss me, miss me, miss me

Someday baby, someday darling
You're gonna miss me
Oh yeah...

Oooo - Oooo - Oooo - Oooo.......

My darlin' I have often thought of things we used to do
And now I sit and wonder why you're gone and left me blue
You said you'd never leave me, you said you'd never go

Oh my darlin', why do I love you so?
Oh my darlin', why do I love you so?

Oooo - Oooo - Oooo - Oooo.......

Is it because you stroked my hair when you were by my side?
Or is it because of the tears you cried when your little puppy died?
You said you'd never leave me, you said you'd never go

Oh my darlin', why do I love you so?
Oh my darlin', why do I love you so?

They tell us we're different
We haven't the right
To decide for ourselves, dear
What's black and what's white

Keep saying you love me
And they'll look upon
A teenager's romance
That goes on and on

You are the answer to my lonely prayer
You are an angel from above
I was so lonely till you came to me
With the wonder of your love

I don't know how I ever lived before
You are my life
My destiny
Oh, my darling
I love you so
You mean everything to me

If you should ever, ever go away
There would be lonely tears to cry
The sun above would be never shine again
There would be teardrops in the sky

So hold me close and never let me go
And say our love will always be
Oh, my darling
I love you so
You mean everything to me (you mean everything to me)

So hold me close and never let me go
And say our love will always be
Oh, my darling
I love you so
You mean everything to me

56,Down In The Willow Garden,Songs Our Daddy Taught Us,The Everly Brothers,1958,184666,43,"

Down in the Willow garden
Where me and my love did meet
As we sat a-courtin'
My love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of Burgundy wine
My love she did not know
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below

I drew a sabre through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
Which was a dreadful sign
My father often told me
That money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connolly

My father sits at his cabin door
Wiping his tear-dimmed eyes
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high
My race is run, beneath the sun
The scaffold now waits for me
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly

Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you

Now you say you're lonely
Said you cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river

Oohhh
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
So what?
Just cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me
(Bye-bye, my love)
You nearly drove me out of my head
(Bye-bye, my love)
While you never shed a tear
Remember?
I remember all you said

Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Go on and cry me a river
I'd like to see you cry me a river
'Cause I'm tired of crying over
You

Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man´s made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that´s a-weak and a back that´s strong

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don´t you call me ´cause I can´t go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin´ when the sun didn´t shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said ´Well, a-bless my soul´

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don´t you call me ´cause I can´t go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin´, it was drizzlin´ rain
Fightin´ and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake* by an ol´ mama lion
Cain´t no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don´t you call me ´cause I can´t go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin´, better step aside
A lotta men didn´t, a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don´t a-get you, then the left one will

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don´t you call me ´cause I can´t go
I owe my soul to the company store
