[Verse 1]
Someone found a letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered too
If, by chance, you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Now, now, don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, it kinda made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air

[Chorus]
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio

If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in, you may find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud, they said it really loud

On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit

You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

They let you dream just to watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way

There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life putting money in his wallet

Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July

On the corner at the end of the block

Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away

Because we've only just begun

Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
You would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin' jam on

[Verse 3]
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
Because we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

[Chorus]
You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you

Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, you

Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Na, na na...
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Nobody told you Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' you would not believe it because you never thought that you would be jammin'
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, You may as well believe what you are feeling

[Intro]
Ooh, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain’t no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you’re gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too

Ah-ha this kiss you give

While we're cruisin' around in the street
Listen up for the party in feet
Slap me five that's the place we've arrived, it's alive

Gonna stomp, all night
Wanna party, 'til the morning light

Mmm, runnin', runnin', runnin'

The set is hot, there's people wall to wall
Old ones, young things, short ones standing tall
So grab the one with the smile on her face
And hit the floor and stay right on the case
The heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone

Everybody take it to the top

[Verse 1]
What's the matter with
The clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some
Old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been
Hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy
Till you spend a lot of money

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 2]
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set
Of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise
The miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true
Baby blue Continental

[Chorus]
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

[Bridge]
Oh, it doesn't matter
What they say in the papers
Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

[Verse 4]
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money
On a new set of speakers
You get more mileage
From a cheap pair of sneakers

[Chorus]
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

[Saxophone solo]

[Verse 5]
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about
The new fashion honey?
All you need are looks
And a whole lotta money

[Chorus]
It's the next phase, new wave
Dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

Come on and jump to the beat
Come on and dance with me

The price you paid was dear
You make the moves come alive
Yet movements dance with fear

Your specialties lonely nights
As you and pride compete
Neglect the pain you hide
Come on and dance with me

[Verse 2:]
You'd rather dance alone
When love steps too near
Communicate with me
Your doubts will disappear

If it's love you're searching for
There's plenty love in me
Embrace the good things in life
Come on and dance with me

Having fun and playing fools
Smashing up the woodwork tools

All the teachers in the pub
Passing round the ready rub
Trying not to think of when
The lunchtime bell will ring again

Oh what fun we had
But did it really turn out bad
All i learnt at school
Was how to bend not break the rules
Oh what fun we had
But at the time it seemed so bad
Trying different ways to
Make a difference to

The headmaster's had enough today
All the kids have gone away
Gone to fight with next door's school
Every term that is the rule
Sits alone and bends his cane
Same old backsides again
All the small ones tell tall tales
Walking home and squashing snails

Lots of smells and lots of noise
Playing football in the park
Kicking pushbikes after dark

Pulling hair and eating dirt

Ha!
Soldier is turning
See him through white light
Running from strangers
See you in the valley

War upon war
Heat upon heat
To cut a long story short, I lost my mind

Sitting on a park bench
Years away from fighting
Ah, to cut a long story short, I lost my mind

Standing in the dark
Oh, I was waiting for men to come
I am beautiful and clean
And so very, very young
To be standing in the street
To be taken by someone

Standing in the dark
Oh, I was waiting for man to come
I am beautiful and clean
And so very very young
To be standing in the street
To be taken by someone

Questions, questions
Give me no answers
That's all they ever give me
Questions, questions

Oh, look at the strange boy
He finds it hard existing
To cut a long story short, I lost my mind

Oh, to cut a long story short, I lost my...
Mind!

You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me

Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given

Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love

Now, I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away

And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

Face to face, sightless solitude

And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet

Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow

Seismic decibel, bite the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology

No sign of bad luck in rapture

Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars
Won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot

[Verse 1]
Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Downtown the young ones are going
Downtown the young ones are growing

[Chorus]
We're the kids in America (whoa)
We're the kids in America (whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

[Verse 2]
Bright lights, the music gets faster
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance
Hot-shot (shot), give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory

[Chorus]
We're the kids in America (whoa)
We're the kids in America (whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

Come closer, honey, that's better
Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight
Outside a new day is dawning
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere
I don't want to go, baby

[Pre-Chorus 3]
New York to east California
There's a new wave coming, I warn ya

Yeah

[Verse 1]
I can tell by the look in your eyes
You've been bored for a long, long time
You need love and so do I
Let's turn it all around
I don't want an everlasting thing
I don't care if I see you again
So grab your coat and honey tell your friends
You won't be home
You won't be home
You won't be home

Tonight I'm yours
Do anything that you want me to

Yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't really want to challenge you
Marry you or remember you
I just wanna make love to you
For 24 hours or more
Or more
I'm only looking for a fantasy
An interlude from reality
Don't want nobody tryin' to rescue me
So rock me babe
Rock me babe
Rock me, rock me

Tonight I'm yours
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me

And tomorrow morning we won't cry
You go your way, honey, I'll go mine
I'm the one who didn't waste your time
Remember me this way
And if you never see my face again
Think of me as a permanent friend
The one who loved you like a hurricane
Then disappeared
Disappeared
Disappeared

Tonight I'm yours
Do anything that you want me to
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me
Tonight I'm yours
Do anything 'cause I want you to

I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels, setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

[Verse 2]
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""Oh, that's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry""
And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels, breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day

Be set aside for his recognition

That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing

Back it up twice
Now that fits nice

Operate around the clock
So why don't you come in?
Lots of space for everyone
One for you my friend
My lines are short, I'll fix you up
So won't you please come on
Shiny sleek machine you wheel
I've got to blow your horn

[Chorus]
Pull up to my bumper baby
In your long black limousine
Pull up to my bumper baby
And drive it in between

Pull up to it, don't drive through it
Back it, up twice, now that fits nice
Grease it, spray it
Let me lubricate it

Lady
You bring me up when I'm down
Maybe
You're gonna change my life around

You came to me when I was lonely
And no one cared
You made me see that I was only
Just running scared
I saw your face and something told me
You were the one
You smiled at me and now I see
My life's begun

[Chorus]
Lady
You brought me in from out the rain (Yeah)
Maybe
My life will never be the same

Once I was filled with desperation
A solitary man
You gave me hope and inspiration
Like only true love can
Now I believe in what you're saying
I'm ten feet tall
This love don't need no explaining
We've got it all

[Verse 1]
I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much
I just don't wanna stop

[Chorus]
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

[Verse 2]
Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

[Outro]
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never too much
(Never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much

And I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A thousand kisses from you is never

I just don't wanna stop
Oh, my love
A million days in your arms is never too much

When you're in love, you know you're in love
No matter what you try to do
You might as well resign yourself
To what you're going through
If you're a hard man or if you're a child
It still might get to you
Don't kid yourself, you've seen it all before
A million mouths have said that too, ooh

I've had my hard times (hard times!) in the past
I've been a husband and a lover too
I've laid alone and cried at night
Over what love made me do
And the loved ones who let me down
And couldn't share my point of view
But this is Phil talking, I wanna tell you
What I found to be true

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action

I believe, I believe what the old man says
Though I know that there's no Lord above
I believe in me, I believe in you
And you know I believe in love
I believe in truth, though I lie a lot
I feel the pain from the push and shove
No matter what you put me through
I'll still believe in love, and I say

I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action

I love your love action

Fun, natural fun

With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Time isn't present in that dimension
You'll take my arm
When we're walkin', rolling and rocking
It is one time I'm glad I'm not a man
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

I'm in Heaven
With the maven of funk mutation
Clinton's musicians such as Bootsy Collins
Raise expectations to a new intention
No one can sing
Quite like Smokey, Smokey Robinson
Wailin' and skankin' to Bob Marley
Reggae's expanding with Sly and Robbie

{Intro}

[Verse 1]
Gloria, you're always on the run now
Running after somebody
You gotta get him somehow
I think you've got to slow down
Before you start to blow it
I think you're headed for a breakdown
So be careful not to show it

[Chorus]
You really don't remember
Was it something that he said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?

[Verse 2]
Gloria, don't you think you're fallin'?
If everybody wants you
Why isn't anybody callin'?
You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line
Oh-oh-oh, calling Gloria

[Chorus]
Gloria (Gloria), I think they got your number
(Gloria) I think they got the alias
(Gloria) That you've been living under
(Gloria) But you really don't remember
Was it something that they said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha
Gloria, how's it gonna go down?
Will you meet him on the main line
Or will you catch him on the rebound?
Will you marry for the money
Take a lover in the afternoon?
Feel your innocence slipping away
Don't believe it's comin' back soon

[Chorus]
And you really don't remember
Was it something that he said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?
Gloria, don't you think you're fallin'?
If everybody wants you
Why isn't anybody callin'?
You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line
Oh-oh-oh, calling Gloria
Gloria (Gloria), I think they got your number
(Gloria) I think they got the alias
(Gloria) That you've been living under
(Gloria) But you really don't remember
Was it something that they said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?

[Verse 1]
Came in from the city
Walked into the door
I turned around when I heard
The sound of footsteps on the floor
Love just like addiction
Now I'm hooked on you
I need some time to get it right
Your love's gonna see me through

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Oh, baby
Make your mind up
Give me what you got
Fix me with your loving
Shut the door and turn the lock
Hey, go get the doctor
Doctor came too late
Another night, I feel all right
My love for you can't wait

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Came in from the city

Said he was a killer

I'm dead when you walk out the door
Hey, babe, I'm hooked on you

Now
The mist across the window hides the lines
But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine
Electricity so fine
Look and dry your eyes

We
So tired of all the darkness in our lives
With no more angry words to say can come alive
Get into a car and drive
To the other side

[Chorus: Joe Jackson]
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light

We
Are young but getting old before our time
We'll leave the T.V. and the radio behind
Don't you wonder what we'll find
Steppin' out tonight?

[Verse 4: Joe Jackson]
You
Can dress in pink and blue just like a child
And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
We'll be there in just a while
If you follow me

Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out

They say that all is fair in love and war
And child believe it
When mama stayed in Saint Tropez
She had a fall or two
And I'm telling it to you straight
So you don't have to hear it in another way
Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy
Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy
They say that out of sight is out of mind
And child believe it
Your mama was in search of love
But all she got was used
And I'm telling it to your face
So you don't have to hear it in another place
Break it to me gently now
Don't forget I'm just a child
Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy

I could see it was a rough-cut Tuesday
Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found
Snapshot image froze without a sound

Thursday morning was a hot flash-factor
Her face still focused in my mind
Test-strip proof-sheet love is hard to find
Friday night we'll dance the spotlight grind
Stop-time heart for me if she's not mine

CHORUS:
Freeze-Frame! (Freeze-Frame!) (REPEAT TWICE)
Freeze-Frame! Now Freeze!
Now I'm lookin' at a flashback Sunday
Zoom lens feelings just won't disappear
Close-up darkroom sweet-talk in my ear
Her hot-spot love for me is strong
This freeze-frame moment can't be wrong
CHORUS (repeat once)
Freeze frame...

I walked along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you
With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
Hypnotize me through

And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day

A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you
The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora borealis comes in view

I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Appearing from my view
Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I couldn't get away

The water shines
A pebble skips across the face
A dozen times
Then disappears, not a trace
Left behind
The thrower turns and walks away
A change of mind
Another start, a brand new day

You know I'll change
If change is what you require
Your every wish
Your every dream, hope, desire

Here comes the mirror man
Says he's a people fan
Here comes the mirror man

And if it seems
I'm not the one you used to know
Our little friendship
Left behind not long ago
Don't feel too hurt
As distance heals the strongest pain
Things are much better now
And just the nagging doubt remains

You know I'll change
If change is what you require
Your every wish
Your every dream, hope, desire

Better stop dreaming of the quiet life
'Cos it's the one we'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus
'Cos those rosey days are few
And...stop apologising for the things you've never done
'Cos time is short and life is cruel
But it's up to us to change
This town called Malice

Rows and rows of disused milk floats
Stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives
Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing
When tears come fast and furious
In a town called Malice
Ye-eh-eah

Those are the ones without the need

But a world of love is what you'll get from me

Now I truly believe
All the money in the world
Can't comfort you the way I wrap my arms around you
And I'll always be there

Only in my dreams I turn you on
Here for just a moment then you're gone
It's just an illusion

Putting me back in all this confusion?
Could it be that it's just an illusion now?

Hey sucker

Hey sucker
(Now there's nothing you can do)

Well I hadn't seen your face around town awhile
So I greeted you, with a knowing smile
When I saw that girl upon your arm
I knew she won your heart with a fatal charm
I said ""Soul boy, let's hit the town""
I said ""Hey boy, what's with the frown?""
But in return, all you could say was
""Hi George, meet my fiancee""

What took us so long to find each other, baby?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong
But I knew the answer to why people fall in love
But then I found I knew nothing about it
Till I met you, girl, I thought that I had had enough
Now I'm sure I've always been without it
And it feels so good that you and I can go together
Ooh baby, we won't find what we've been looking for
And this time I know we're gonna make it better
Our heart is a key to pump it at the door
Don't have to search no more
There it is, there it is
What took us so long, ooh, to find each other, baby?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong
In the sea of love we set our sails when waters were up
Two in search of love with no direction
Fish were biting at the time when catching wasn't enough
We couldn't make a sport of our affection
And who could change that we would sail into each other
Ooh girl, I never felt the wave of love so strong
And this love I never felt in any other
I trust it like the lighthouse guides the ship to land
I found it when you touched my hand
There it is
What took us so long for a love so strong?
There it is, there it is

And it's about time
For love to find its way back home

Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by
I'm looking through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes, we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

The pages from my mind are stripped

We can turn this world around
We can live through all eternity

With this true love I found
Picks my feet up off the ground to fly away
With this true love my dear
Takes away my every fear, don't go away

You just don't know what you did to me
But I'm not the same
Since you gave me love
That's sheltered from the rain
You just don't know how you make me feel
Your sweet lovin' girl, is so unreal

[Paroles de ""Faut tenir""]

[Couplet 1 : Vin7]
Allez souris, man, on vit pas comme au Suriname
Bien que tu puisses tomber sur un homme, qui pour un rien te sors une lame
Peu importe les obstacles, faut tenir le coup, sans verser de larmes
Alors, défends-toi, prends les armes, et transforme tes paroles en art
75018, si tu t'demandes encore d'où j'sors
Même après une grosse cuite, j'fais rarement les choses en douceur
J'taperais jamais la fuite, même si faut tenir pendant des heures
La vie m'la toujours bien appris, c'est pas en s'branlant qu't'as c'que tu désires
Même si ça fait désordre, faut tenir tête à tous ces hommes
Qui pour un rien t'emprisonnent et croient encore qu'ils t’impressionnent
J'veux rien d'voir à personne même si j'accumule pas les sommes
Faut juste que je tiennes le coup, jusqu'à c'que ma dernière heure sonne

[Couplet 2 : Hugo]
Impossible à calmer, acharnée, c'est la jeunesse basanée
Le positif, c'est comme le fond d'mon verre : J'le vois jamais
J'ai bien capté les signes, mais malgré ça j'ai heurté les récifs
D'puis qu'on m'a présenté un certain Jack qui vient du Tennessee
Faut avancer ou reculer, rien à foutre, marre de c'présent
Commissariat et crack, Paris 18, y a pas de port de plaisance
Paris plage, c'est du pugilat pas du Beach-volley
Les gosses ils veulent des tass, des gros gamos, des billets violets
L'art de la disquette, mec, tu connais pas demande à Kay
Ici les vrais amis se raréfient, pire que les mandats cash
Tu peux sourire, mais belek, c'est pas le prince de Bel-air
On bat de l'aile, fiston, inspiration à base de Bailey's
On tient debout, on tient le coup, grâce au crew, aux sins-cou
Pour les dalleux, prêts à braquer la Brinks avec un 5 coups
Par ici faut pas rester, prendre l'essentiel et vendre le reste
Jeunes paresseux, mais forts en son c'est Paris Nord et banlieue est

[Couplet 3 : Al Pa]
On m'a dit faut tenir le coup, tenir la cadence
Pour être au top, faudrait avoir un minimum d'endurance
Ouais les frères sont soudés, mais seulement dans la merde
Ramasse un biff, tu verras bien, comment ça se dissout derrière
Faut tenir le cap, être le capitaine de son avenir
Et si ça se gâte, faut être le dernier à quitter le navire
Ça part en vrille, on sait plus trop à quoi se tenir
Y a que la merde qui s'accroche et le pire est à venir
J'tiens la corde, laisse la ficelle aux wack MC
J'suis en forme, et mes punchlines, j'les fait à crédit
Y a rien d'crédible, règle 1 faut s'entretenir
Y a que devant la miff que j'suis obligé d'bien m'tenir

[Couplet 4 : L'éxilé]
Les jeunes d'aujourd'hui, veulent la une des faits divers
Pourtant on l'a toujours dit mais à force les récits divergent
Toutes les peines s'alourdissent, ça d'vient chaud d'récidiver
Les esprits s'engourdissent, et les plus faibles divaguent
Que le business qui compte, certains se disent mais quel con
J'mets la patate, qu'elle cogne les jaloux, les fach, les dés-con
Faut tenir le coup et ne pas s'laisser aller
Arrêter d'jouer au con comme [?]

[Couplet 4 : Scar]
On sait qu'faut tenir quand ça part en couille
Éviter d'foncer droit dans le gouffre
Bizarrement, le sale argent coule, vu la demande faut qu'ça se passe en douce
On s'associe, on taffe aussi pour la plus rare d'entre nous
Pour la plupart dans la merde, mais y a pas de pule-crap dans le pe-grou
Sans ffe-schnou dans le zen c'est comme ça qu'on fonctionne
S C A R du 77, check les wack ont trop le seum
Avec les gros du 18eme, on tient le crom, on l'lâchera pas
Retiens le nom, écarte pas ta chatte, y a personne pour refaire le monde

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side

120,Tell Her About It,An Innocent Man,Billy Joel,1983-08-08,229200,57,"

[Verse 1]
Listen boy don't want to see you
Let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like
Watching anybody make
The same mistakes that I made

[Bridge 1]
She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you
What you should do

[Verse 2]
Listen boy I'm sure that you think
You got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're a big boy now
And you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing
She ought to know

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

[Verse 3]
Listen boy it's not automatically
A certain guarantee
To insure yourself you've got to provide
Communication constantly

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one
Good way to reassure

[Chorus 2]
Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe

[Bridge 2]
Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?

[Verse 4]
Listen boy it's good information
From a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you
What you should do

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

[Outro]
Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it
Tell her now that you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You've got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell, tell, tell her about it
Now, tell her about it

Old before their time
They married young
For love at last
Was their only crime

How come I love them now ?

You're so young at heart

Young at heart
Yet not a chance
To be a child at all
They told us tales
They told us lies
Don't they know
The shouldn't have told us at all

How come I love them now ?
How come I love them more ?
When all I wanted to do when I was old
Was to walk out the door

Trick a kiss in time?
Who am I to say that's crazy?
Love will make you blind. .

I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

And you say - ""What have I got to lose?""

Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)

You need a love that's gonna last

I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

Last night, I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry clean
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean?
And you said

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

You're on a roll and now you pray it lasts
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast?
And she said

Ain't nothin' gonna break-a my stride

With parts made in Japan (Secret, secret, I've got a secret)

[Verse 2]
I've got a secret I've been hiding under my skin
My heart is human, my blood is boiling, my brain IBM
So if you see me acting strangely, don't be surprised
I'm just a man who needed someone and somewhere to hide
To keep me alive, just keep me alive
Somewhere to hide to keep me alive

I'm not a robot without emotions, I'm not what you see
I've come to help you with your problems, so we can be free
I'm not a hero, I'm not a savior, forget what you know
I'm just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control
Beyond my control, we all need control

I've never been closer
I tried to understand
That certain feeling
Carved by another's hand, oh

But it's too late to hesitate
We can't keep on living like this

Leave no track
Don't look back

Temptation

Temptation

Temptation
(Trouble is coming)
Temptation
(It's just the high cost of loving)
Temptation

Temptation

You've got to make me an offer
That cannot be ignored
So let's head for home now
Everything I have is yours, oh

Step by step and day by day
Every second counts, I can't break away

Leave no trace
Hide your face

(All I desire)
Temptation
(Keep climbing higher and higher)
Temptation
(You can take it or leave it)
Temptation
(But you'd better believe it)

Step by step and day by day
Every second counts, I can't break away

(Keep us from temptation)
(Keep us from temptation)
(Lead us not into temptation, oh)

(Tryin' to find it)
Temptation
(You've got to get up behind it)
Temptation

[Intro]
Woo woo

[Verse 1]
Dear mommy, dear daddy
You had plans for me, oh yeah
I was your only son
And long before this baby boy
Could count to three
You knew just what he would become
Run along to school
No child of mine grows up a fool
Run along to school
When you tried to tell me what to do
I just shut my mouth and smiled at you
One thing that I know for sure

[Chorus]
Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo

[Verse 2]
Dear mommy, dear daddy
Now I’m 19, as you see
I'm handsome, tall and strong
So what the hell gives you the right
To look at me as if to say “Hell, what went wrong?”
Where were you last night?
You look as if you had a fight
Where were you last night?
Well I think that you may just be right
But don’t try to keep me in tonight
Because I’m big enough to break down the door

[Chorus]
Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo

[Bridge]
Boys like you are bad through and through
Still, girls like me
Always seem to be with you
We can’t help but worry
(You’re in such a hurry)
Mixing with the wrong boys
(Playing with the wrong toys)
Easy girls (And late nights)
Cigarettes (And love bites)
Why do you have to be so cruel?
You’re such a fool

[Chorus]
Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise
Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Bad boys, stick together
Never, sad boys
Doo doo doo doo doo, woo woo
Good guys, they made rules for fools
So get wise

134,Speak Like A Child,Introducing The Style Council,The Style Council,1983-01-01,197013,40,"

Your hair hangs in golden steps
You're a bonafide in every respect
You are walking through streets that mean nothing to you
You believe you're above it and I don't really blame you
Maybe that's why you speak like a child;
The things you're saying like ""I'm so free and so wild""
And I believe it when you look in my eyes;
You offer me a life, and never lies
Least only the kind to make me smile

Your clothes are clean and your mind is productive
It shops in store where only the best buy
You're cool and hard, and if I sound like a lecher
It's probably true
But at least there's no lecture

I really like it when you speak like a child
The crazy sayings like ""I'm so free and so wild""
You have to make a bargain with me now
A promise that you won't change somehow
No way, now how

Spent all day thinking about you
Spent all night coming to terms with it
Time and conditions are built to tame
Nothing lasts with age, so people say
But I will always try to feel the same

I really like it when you speak like a child
I really like it when you speak like a child
The way you hate the homely rank and the file
The way you're so proud to be oh, so free and so wild

I really like it when you speak like a child
I really like it when you speak like a child
I really like it when you speak like a child
The way you're so proud to be oh, so free and so wild

Love is a battlefield

[Verse 1]
You're begging me to go
Then making me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way
Or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me
I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love
And I'm chained to your side

Will you turn me away
Or touch me deep inside?
And when all this gets old
Will it still feel the same?
There's no way this will die

I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders
You'll need me to hold

It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl

There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller

So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Ooh, babe (Thriller night)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Oh, darling (Oh, baby)
Thriller night, babe (Thriller night, babe)

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)
Whoo

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh no, lets go

Until they put us in the truck, let's go

But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what’s it all for?)
You better live now
'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Disguise and bruises, don’t know how you do it
Going through it, girl you got Adonis
You’re the truest, has more to offer than just making babies
Told to sit down and then act like a lady
Stay in your place, where is that exactly
Not in the kitchen cooking cleaning the dishes
So early not over your knee
Watch the way that you’re talking to me

Re-routed her destiny

Oh I hurt you girl, my bad, I thought you like that
She just wants her life back
This is what happens when you bring her down, you take the crown

Out here wildin’, acting childish, bashing cars in
Can’t you see that she's scarred
She’s been enduring with a broken heart, my god
There is so much damage, you’re so demanding
Brought her closer then left her stranded
No closure, it’s open-ended
Co-dependent, incoherent, can’t compare it, loose cannon
Can hardly manage, feeling famished
Wishing she could vanish
Trying not to panic
Got to get established
Too late in the game
Still gonna take a stab at it
And desperately for change
I desire better for myself
That requires for me to start asking for some help
Taking baby steps, trying to do my best
Been tested, more than the rest, life ain’t fair, but I’m not upset
Reminded every day, I cannot forget
[?] and conquered out of shit

[Outro]
Hold on tight, you got it
We will not be quiet
She cannot be silenced
Never doubt your power
You better ask somebody
You don’t want no problems now
Do you know who you are girl?
Lady you are a goddess, you are a goddess

Sent me off to a foreign land

Went down to see my V.A. man

Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon

Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go

Restless night, wanna be with you

So enticing, should I take a bite?

On hearts and fingers

With narrow confidence
Like a child at birth
A man with no defense
What's mine's my own

Fighting in the streets

Wearing white as you're walkin'
Down the street of my soul

That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride
That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride

Start your journey
Early or maybe later
(Get your boots on)
Look for rainbows
(It's cloudy)
Take your hair-dryer, blow them all away

In you, I've found a story I want to keep hearing
In you, I see all colours, not just black or white
In you, I find a reason and hope for all dreamers
You are my fill, you're my supply of love and pride

That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride
That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and p-p-p-p-pride

Knowing, sensing
Seeing, eating, sleeping
(That's just being)
Touching and testing
Loving, wanting and taking more love and more pride

In you, I've found a story I want to keep hearing
In you, I see all colours, not just black or white
In you, I find a reason and hope for all dreamers
You are my fill, you're my supply of love and pride

175,The Power Of Love,Greatest Hits: Huey Lewis And The News,Huey Lewis & The News,2006-01-01,234333,73,"

[Verse 1]
The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love
Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

[Chorus]
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

[Verse 2]
First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go'round

[Chorus 2]
And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

[Bridge]
They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmmm

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel nothin' till you feel
You feel the power, just feel the power of love
That's the power, that's the power of love
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Feel the power of love

All the old paintings on the tomb
They do the sand dance, don't you know?

They're falling down like a domino
All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (Oh-way-oh)

179,Chain Reaction,Eaten Alive,Diana Ross,1985-09-24,230533,59,"

You took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing
Something that you do
And I was there and not dancing with anyone
You took a little, then you took me over
You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying, trying, anything for you

I'm in the middle of a chain reaction
You give me all the after midnight action
I wanna get you where I can let you make all that love to me
I'm on a journey for the inspiration
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation
I need you to get me nearer to you
So you can set me free
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love

You make me tremble when your hand moves lower
You taste a little then you swallow slower
Nature has a way of yielding treasure
Pleasure made for you, oh
You gotta plan, your future is on the run
Shine a light for the whole world over
You never find your love if you hide away
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is

Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
I wanna get your love all ready for the sweet sensation
Instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you
With no more left to say
We talk about love, love, love
We talk about love
You let me hold you for the first explosion
My arms will cover you all you gotta do

Get in the middle of a chain reaction (chain reaction)
You get a medal when you're lost in action (lost in action)
Don't pass me by
I wanna get your love all ready
For the sweet sensation, instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion
We get a picture of our love in motion
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you
Sooner or later all you gotta do is
Get in the middle of a chain reaction
You get a medal when you're lost in action
I wanna get your love all ready
For the sweet sensation, instant radiation
You let me hold you for the first explosion

Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed

I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder]
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me, I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Verse 2]
If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's ""discreet"" with part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek it's really you my part-time lover

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

We are undercover passion on the run, yeah
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Verse 3]
I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers

[Intro]
I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

[Verse 1]
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far

[Chorus 1]
But when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Ya, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, ya

[Chorus 2]
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh Yeah!
Back in the summer of '69
Oh!

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever
Forever, no...

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about ya 'n wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh, the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never

Ooh...
Ooh...
How - how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often
But making mistakes is a part
Of life's imperfections born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear the time
That told the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
Don't want to be without you
Baby tonight
Because there's something about you
Baby so right
I couldn't live without you
Baby tonight

Ooh...
Ooh...
And there's something about you
I couldn't live without you
Tonight

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door
She wore a...

The kind you find in a second hand store

And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks
She wore a...

And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

The kind you find in a second hand store

And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

Some feel the heat and decide that they can't go on
Some like it hot, but you can't tell how hot till you try
Some like it hot, so let's turn up the heat till we fry
Feel the heat pushing you to decide
Feel the heat burning you up, ready or not
Some like it hot, and some sweat when the heat is on
Some feel the heat and decide that they can't go on
Some like it hot, but you can't tell how hot till you try
Some like it hot, so let's turn up the heat till we fry
Some like it hot, some like it hot
Some like it hot, some like it hot
Some like it hot, some like it hot
Some like it hot, some like it hot

Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer

Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat

Everybody gather 'round now
Let your body feel the heat
Don't you worry if you can't dance
Let the music move your feet
It's the rhythm of the island
Like the sugar cane so sweet
If you want to do the conga
You've got to listen to the beat

Feel the fire of desire
As you dance the night away
'Cause tonight we're gonna party
'Til we see the break of day
Better get yourself together
And hold on to what you've got
Once the music hits your system
There's no way you're gonna stop

201,We Close Our Eyes,Go West,Go West,1985-01-01,221506,52,"

Inside everyone hides one desire
Outside no one would know
Danger close to edge of the knife
Safer not to let go
And while we miss chances
You can almost hear time slipping away

We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes to time slipping away

No show, Wednesday girl waits with the wine
She knows just what to say
While no one listens
You can almost hear time slipping away

We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes and

We can talk to strangers
We are burning with the spark
And we can walk on water
We are tigers in the dark
We are burning

We close our eyes

Heroes never give into the night
He knows how far he can run
And as he surrenders
You can almost hear time slipping away

We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes

We close our eyes, we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes

We close our eyes, we walk on water
Lets us take the blame
We are burning
Talk to strangers

If I was a better man
Would fellow men take me to their hearts
If I was a stronger man
Carrying the weight of popular demand
Tell me would that alarm her
I'd never harm her at all

If I was a soldier
Captive arms I'd lay before her
If I was a sailor
Seven oceans I'd sail to her

If I was a wiser man
Would other men reach out and touch me
If I was a kinder man
Dishing up love for a hungry world
Tell me would that appease her
I want to please her again

If I was a painter
I'd paint a world that couldn't taint her
If I was a leader
On food of love from above I would feed her

If I was a poet
All my love in burning words I would show it
If I was her lover
Her eyes in kisses I would cover

Come here my baby
Oh they can't touch you now
I'll keep you safe and warm
I'll never leave you at all

Come here my baby
Oh they won't touch you
Dishing up love for a hungry world
Tell me would that appease you
I want to please you again

If I was a soldier
Captive arms I'd lay before her

Meeting you with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places, feel the chill

Nightfall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still overseas, could it be the whole Earth opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
A week is why, until we...

That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

The choice for you is the view to a kill
Between the shades assassination standing still

Earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body
First time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die, but can we...

[Chorus]
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

When all we see is the view to a kill

In my young life I have received
Callers as though they were Christmas Eve
Disappointed and I don't know why?
She gave me laughter and hope
And a sock in the eye
(A love like this is sealed with a kiss)

In my young life and I know something now
I've never tried to create a wow
Wows are few frustration more common
Now I can feel it in my soul
That's why I gave the come on

Kiss me with your mouth
Your love is better than wine
But wine is all I have
Will your love ever be mine?

Faces fall before my feet
Like blood onto a clean white sheet
When I grow old I won't forget
To innocence my only debt

Wow I feel so fresh today
Barefoot in the snow to make love in the hay
The stars are bright in the abyss
Now I can feel you in my arms
I explode inside your kiss

And there's a place for us in a dirty movie
'Cause no one does it better than me and you

Take me to the edge of heaven
Tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide your baby's eyes and we can
Take me to the edge of heaven

[Verse 1]
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love

She says, ""We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot""

Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
""Baby, it's okay
Someday""

[Pre-Chorus]
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love

Yo, pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls
Tell yo brother, yo sister
And yo momma too
'Cause we're about to throw down
And you'll know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air
Like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance quick, mama
Come on baby, tell me, what's the word?

Word up! It's the code word
No matter where you say it
You'll know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker DJs
Who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason
And we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you've got to realize
That you're acting like fools
Give us music, we can use it
We need to dance
We don't have the time

I can't believe that you're alone in here

Who never gave half of what he got

Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, ohoh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

To cheer the night along

[Verse 1: Rev Run, D.M.C., & Both]
Now there's a backseat lover that's always undercover
And I talk 'til my daddy say
Said, ""You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin""
""And there's sure to be a change in ways""
Now, there's a cheerleader that's a real big bleeder
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this

[Chorus: Rev Run, D.M.C., & Both]
See-saw swinging with the boys in school
And her feet was flying up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle with the kitty in the middle""
And they swinging like it just don't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Rev Run]
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Well, just gimme a kiss
Ooh, like this

[Verse 2: Rev Run, D.M.C., & Both]
School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt hanging way up her knee
It was three young ladies in the school gym locker
And they found they were looking at D
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
That my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
And I gave the girl a little kiss, like this

[Chorus: Steven Tyler, Steven Tyler & Run-D.M.C.]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle, with your kitty in the middle""
I was swinging like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin' when she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to

[Chorus:  Steven Tyler & Rev Run]
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Well, just gimme some head

Watching the sky's first light

Watch out!

[Verse 1]
I see you on the street, and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance
You'd see my desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want
Don't try to resist me

Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

[Verse 2]
I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad, boy, I wonder why
I follow you around, but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say

Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

[Verse 1]
A man walks down the street
He says, ""Why am I soft in the middle, now?
Why am I soft in the middle?
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard""
Bonedigger, Bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away in my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore

[Chorus]
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al

[Verse 2]
A man walks down the street
He says, ""Why am I short of attention?
Got a short little span of attention
And, whoa, my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family?
What if I die here?
Who'll be my role model
Now that my role model is gone, gone?""
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along, along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

[Chorus]
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al
Call me Al

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the third world
Maybe it's his first time around
Doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound, the sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says, ""Amen and Hallelujah!""

[Chorus]
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al
Call me

Everything is wonderful
Being here is heavenly
Every single day, she says
Everything is free

I used to be so careless
As if I couldn't care less
Did I have to make mistakes
When I was Mary's prayer?

Suddenly, the heavens roared
Suddenly, the rain came down
Suddenly was washed away
The Mary that I knew

So when you find somebody who keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake
When I was Mary's prayer

So if I say save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven for me

Blessed is the one who shares
Your power and your beauty, Mary
Blessed is the millionaire
Who shares your wedding day

So when you find somebody who keep
Think of me and celebrate
I made such a big mistake
When I was Mary's prayer

So if I say save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven

Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven for me

If you want the fruit to fall
You have to give the tree a shake
But if you shake the tree too hard
The bough is gonna break

And if I can't reach the top of the tree
Oh, Mary, you can pull me up there
What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer

So if I say save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven

Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
And if I say ten Hail Marys
Leave a light on in Heaven

Save me, save me
Be the light in my eyes
What I wouldn't give to be

What I wouldn't give to be
When I was Mary's prayer
Save me (What I wouldn't give to be)

Just think of the magic
Come on listen:
My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumble

Come on listen:
My love has taken a tumble
But I'm still standing

If you had only, only, only ...
Love me like you use to do

Just that sweet little mystery that makes me try
Try, try, try
Come on listen:
Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Try, try, try
Com'on, com'on, com'on
My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumble

Gonna make a move that knocks you over
Watch this turn this one's gonna put you away
But I'm doing my very best dancing, yeah
Every time you're looking the other way

Well, I could move out to the left for a while
Or I could slide to the right for a while

Hey, I could get up and back right on track (Is that gonna get you back?)
But is right on track, is that gonna get you back?
Hey, I could get up and back right on track (Is that gonna get you back?)
But is right on track, is that gonna get you back?

Is that gonna get you back?
Is that gonna get you back?

I've been trying to get your attention
Yeah, and I'm very, very close to thinking of a way
Hey, I could be big and tough and other funny stuff, yeah
But you just keep looking the other way

I could move out to the left for a while
Or I could slide to the right for a while

Hey, I could get up and back right on track (Is that gonna get you back?)
But is right on track, is that gonna get you back?
Hey, I could get up and back right on track (Is that gonna get you back?)
But is right on track, is that gonna get you back?

(Right on track) Is that gonna get you back?
Is that gonna get you back?

How far away can you go and still dancing with me?
Would you mind staying in the vicinity
I've not been faring badly
But I would gladly take you back!

(Right on track, ooohooohooohooo
Get you back
Right on track)

There must be some kind of bad connection
Because this music does not sound the way it did
I got to get up and back 'cause I've been off track
And that may be just why you disappeared

But now I've got you in the corner of my eye
And I've got one more move I can try

Hey, I could get up and back right on track (Is that gonna get you back?)
But is right on track, is that gonna get you back?
Yeah, I could get up and back right on track (Is that gonna get you back?)
But is right on track, is that gonna get you back?

(Right on track) Is that gonna get you back?
Is that gonna get you back?

Mmm, I could get up and back right on track (Is that gonna get you back?)
But is right on track, is that gonna get you back?

(Right on track) Is that gonna get you back?
Is that gonna get you back?

Get you back, is that gonna get you back?
Is that gonna get you back?
Is that gonna get you back?
Is that gonna get you back?

Get you back, is that gonna get you back?
Is that gonna get you back?
Is that gonna get you back?

[Verse 1]
I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A certain sense of liberty
I don't care 'cause I'm not there
And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow
Again and again I've taken too much
Of the things that cost you too much

[Chorus]
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning Sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning Sun

[Verse 2]
When I was a very small boy
Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing

[Chorus]
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...

[Verse 3]
I feel so extraordinary
Something's got a hold on me
I get this feeling I'm in motion
A certain sense of liberty
The chances are we've gone too far
You took my time and you took my money
Now I fear you've left me standing
In a world that's so demanding

[Chorus]
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...
I used to think that the day would never come
I'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun
My morning sun is the drug that brings me near
To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear
I used to think that the day would never come
That my life would depend on the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...
On the morning sun...

Last night I was dreaming
I was locked in a prison cell
When I woke up I was screaming
Calling out your name (whoa)

And the judge and the jury
They all put the blame on me (the blame on me)
They wanna tell from my story
They want to hear my plea

Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty (guilty)
Guilty as a girl can be
Come on baby, can't you see
I stand accused
Of love in the first degree

(Guilty) Of love in the first degree

Someday I'm believing
You will come to my rescue
Unchain my heart, you'll keep him
Let me start a new (you)

The hours passed so slowly
Since they've thrown away the key (away the key)
Can't you see that I'm lonely
Won't you help me please

Explanations are complications
We don't need to know the ""Where?"" or ""Why?""

Take, take, take, take, take-take, t-t-take, take
Taking chances, bold advances
Don't care if you think we're out of line
Conversation is interrogation
Get out of here, we just don't have the time

Take, take, take, take, take-take, t-t-take, take
Take or leave us, only please believe us
We ain't never gonna be respectable (respectable)
Like us, hate us, but you'll never change us
We ain't never gonna be respectable (respectable)

Respectable
Respectable
Respectable

Hesitation is just frustration
Give us the music and we're alright
On each occasion, for your information
We can look after ourselves alright

Take, take, take, take, take-take, t-t-take, take
Take or leave us, only please believe us
We ain't never gonna be respectable (respectable)
Like us, hate us, but you'll never change us
We ain't never gonna be respectable (respectable)

Respectable
Respectable (ahahaha)
Respectable

Fascination is our sensation
We like to put ourselves on the line
Recreation is our destination
So, don't wait up for us tonight

Take, take, take, take, take-take, t-t-take, take
Take or leave us, only please believe us
We ain't never gonna be respectable (respectable)
Like us, hate us but you'll never change us
We ain't never gonna be respectable (respectable)

Take or leave us, only please believe us
We ain't never gonna be respectable (respectable)
Like us, hate us but you'll never change us
We ain't never gonna be respectable (respectable)

Take or leave us, only please believe us
We ain't never gonna be respectable

Woke up this morning
Closed in on all sides
Nothing doing
I feel resistance
As I open my eyes
Someone's fooling
I've found a way to break through this cellophane line
Cause I know what's going on in my own mind

Am I living in a box?
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box?
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box?

Life goes in circles
Around and around, circulating
I sometimes wonder
What's moving underground
I'm escaping
I've found a way to break through this cellophane line
Cause I know what's going on in my own mind

Am I living in a box? (living)

Summer in the city where the air is still
A baby being born to the overkill
Well who cares what people say
We walk down love's motorway

Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
And singing hearts and flowers

But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true

A star above the city in the northern chill
A baby being born to the overkill
No say, no place to go
A TV, a radio

Ambition and love wearing boxing gloves
And singing hearts and flowers

But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true

Who could heal
What's never been as one
And our hearts have been torn
Since the day we were born
Just like anyone

From Westwood to Hollywood
The one thing that's understood
Is that you can't buy time
But you can sell your soul
And the closest thing to heaven is to rock and roll

But somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be
Is true

Somewhere in my heart
There is a star that shines for you
Silver splits the blue
Love will see it through
And somewhere in my heart
There is the will to set you free
All you've got to be

He would swear by his mouth almighty

Our lives are indivisible, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in
It's getting you nowhere
Cause it hurts, you never let go
Don't look down, just look up
Cause she's always there behind you, just to remind you

[Chorus]
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind

[Verse 2]
Cause there's no easy way to, to understand it
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like i'm blinded
And it teaches you to never let go
There's so much love you'll never know
She can reach you no matter how far
Wherever you are

[Chorus]
Two hearts, believing in just one mind
Beating together till the end of time
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind
Together forever till the end of time

There will always be a special place in my heart for her
She knows, she knows, she knows

295,Love Changes (Everything),Everything,Climie Fisher,1988-03-14,268186,64,"

I was only seventeen when she looked at me that way
Seems like yesterday
I was only fooling round but she stole my heart away
I've never been the same

I felt the strangest feeling
Like a raging fire it burned
She left, I cried for weeks
And I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings, oho

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

Then the years went rolling by, I grew up and moved away
Had to earn my pay
Found another lover then but my heart is sad to say
It only ended up the same way

And I wondered: was I destined to spend my life alone?
Oh, girl, you answered my question
This time it's working, you've given me new hope

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

I've seen the way love shakes you, makes you, breaks you
It's got a power of its own

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings
Don't forget it, girl

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Don't you forget it, baby
Love changes everything

(Love makes you fly) Flying away, oho
(Love changes) Let's make love
(Love changes everything) Oh

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings
Don't forget it, girl (Love changes)
Don't you forget it, baby
Love changes everything

Memories of loving her, holding her tight every night

Don't go! Don't go!

And He'll show you the way

Those who are heavily laden
Come to me, all of you who are tired
Of carrying heavy loads
For the yoke I will give you is easy
And My burden is light
Come to Mе and I will give you rest

When you feel thе world
Is tumblin' down on you
And you have no one
That you can hold on to
Just face the rising sun
And you'll see hope
And there's no need to run
Lift up your hands to God
And he'll make you feel all right

(Prove your love, Gotta prove your love
If you want to be with me tonite
Show your stuff , Cause words are not enough
I want to hear your body talk to mine)

Boy I can feel a love is on the rise
A message revealed in your eyes
You know I can't wait
To know your passion
It's not to late
So take some action
Can you say that when you're through
I'll know what love is all about
Well, baby I've been patient, now
I'm ready to find out
Chorus
You can tell me that your serious
But I gotta know for sure
You say that you want me
But I've heard it all before
Prove your love gotta prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff, cause words
Are not enough
I want to hear your body

[Intro]
Get busy!

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me (Now now)
Why don't they just let me live? (Ooh)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions (OH!)
That's my prerogative

[Verse 1]
They say I'm crazy, I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty, but I don't give a damn
Getting girls is how I live
Some ask me questions, ""Why am I so real?""
But they don't understand me or really don't know the deal
About a brother, trying hard to make it right
Not long ago, before I win this fight (sing)

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions (OH!)
That's my prerogative

[Refrain]
It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)
I can do just what I feel (It's my prerogative)
No one can tell me what to do (It's my prerogative)
'Cause what I'm doing
I'm doing for you, now

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong, I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships really gets me down
I see nothing wrong with spreading myself around (sing)

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me (Yeah)
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission (I don't need...)

It's my prerogative (It's my prerogative)
I can do what I wanna do (It's my prerogative)
Can live my life (It's my prerogative)
I'm doing it just for you (It's my prerogative)

[Bridge]
Tell me, tell me, why can't I live my life (Live my life)
Without all of the things that people say

[Interlude]
Yo Teddy, kick it like this
Oh, no, no
I can do what I wanna do
Me and you
Together, together, together, together, together

[Chorus]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
(Everybody's talking)
Why don't they just let me live?
(Why don't they just let me live, girl?)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions
(I don't need permission from nobody)
That's my prerogative

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
(Everybody's talking)
Why don't they just let me live? (Now)
I don't need permission (I don't need...)
Make my own decisions (...my own decisions)
That's my prerogative

[Outro]
What is this, a blizzard, that I can't have money in my pocket
And people not talk about me?
This world is a trip; I don't know what's going on these days
Got this person over here talking about me, this person
Ay, listen, let me tell you something, it's my prerogative
I can do what I wanna do
I made this money, you didn't; right, Ted?
We outta here!

It's my, it's my, it's my, it's my
It's my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
It's my...WOO!
It's my prerogative, it's my...
It's my, it's my, my, my
It's my prerogative, can't you see, baby doll?
Ha, why you wanna talk about me?
Tell me, tell me why...

[Verse 1]
Someone I know is staring at me, and when I look into her eyes
I see a girl that I used to be, I hardly recognize
'Cause in the space of a year, I've watched the old me disappear
All of the things I once held precious
Just don't mean anything anymore, 'cause suddenly

[Chorus]
You came and changed the way I feel
No one could love you more
Because you came and turned my life around
No one could take your place

[Verse 2]
I've never felt good with permanent things, now I don't want anything to change
You can't imagine the joy you bring, my life won't be the same
And I'll be there when you call, I'll pick you up if you should fall
'Cause I have never felt such inspiration
Nobody else ever gave me more because

[Chorus]
You came and changed the way I feel
No one could love you more
Because you came and turned my life around
No one could take your place
You came
You came and turned my life around
No one could take your place

[Bridge]
I watch you sleep in the still of the night
You look so pretty when you dream
So many people just go through life
Holding back, they don't say what they mean
But it's easy for me since you came

[Chorus]
No one could love you more
Because you came and turned my life around
No one could take your place
You came and changed the way I feel
No one could love you more
Because you came and turned my life around
No one could take your place
You came

Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee, Twist
Aah, we're back

Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Take me by my little hand and go like this

The party was packed, I'm talkin' back to back
There was a rapper that was rappin' to a beat that was wack
They was going through the motions out on the dance floor
An' when the rapper was done they wasn't yellin' encore
The people were tired of the same old groove
They wanted something def, something new and improved
Something easy to do but hard to resist
I got something for y'all, what do you call it? The Twist!

Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chubby Checker and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take us by our little hands and go like this

We, we, we broke into the booth and the record stacks
Came up with The Twist and we were scratchin' the track
People started jammin' hard to the funky sound
Did The Twist down and up, then up and down
Then I heard somebody yell: ""Yo Chubby's here""
The people took a little pause just to stop and stare
He said: ""I'll show you people how to Twist with style
'Cause I've been doin' The Twist for a long long while""

Oh you should see Prince Markie Dee
Check out that Kool Rock is rockin' like me
Here comes B-Beat Box, come on, do it Buffy

Com' com' com' come on baby
Com' com' com' com' come on baby
Ooh ooh do do do The Twist
Ooh ooh do do do The Twist

Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chub and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take the world by the hand and do The Twist

Chubby took my sister down to the dance floor
Did The Twist so def, the crowd yelled for more
So I pulled it with my mussle, did my flow with my coil
And when Buff did the Limbo we was rockin' the world

Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chubby Checker and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take the world by the hand and go like this

Hey hey, England, do The Twist, Twist
And France, do The Twist, Twist
Ha ha ha, Holland, do The Twist, Twist
And Germany, do The Twist, Twist
And all over Europe, do The Twist, Twist, do The Twist, Twist

Chubby Checker (come on, come on) and the Fat Boys
(Come on, come on, come on, come on) we're doin' The Twist
(Come on, come on, come on) take us by our little hands
And go like this

Oh yeah, and do The Twist

The room has suddenly grown cold
And outside in the street it's raining
You packed your bags and said goodbye
You took my heart without explaining

How could you go

Only you can fill the need in me
If you walk away

Shadows of the past remind me
Of all the love I gave in vain and
All the hurt I feel inside me

I remember
Leaves were falling down in St. Germain
It was a cold November
You went away and I got a dream...

Nobody knows who I am, maybe you would understand
Anybody knows what I am, out in a secret land
Nobody knows how I try not to tell another lie
Anybody knows, in the end I'll find a secret land...

I need you, I feel you
I can't live without you so long...
And I know that we parted
I'll stay in this town 'cause I miss you so...

I feel it, I mean it
The secret that I'm gonna show...
And I turn back, I see that
All my love had to fail but I miss you so...

Nobody knows how I try not to tell another lie
Anybody knows, in the end I'll find a secret land...

It's no use, 'cos it's all you'll need
Don't hold back
Make up your mind
Don't hold back
Stand up for your love rights and enjoy it
Stand up for your love rights

[Verse 1]
You keep on asking me
""Why can't we be together?""
I keep saying ""Won't you wait a while?""
What's all the hurry?
I thought we had forever
I just need time 'til I can make up my mind
I'm not asking for a love to last forever
I don't expect to get a guarantee
It's just that I believe
Lovers should stick together
I'm only saying, won't you wait for me?

[Chorus]
I've got to be, got to be certain
I've got to be so sure
I've had my share of hearts broken
And I don't wanna take that any more

[Verse 2]
I've got some friends who say
Boys are all the same
They're only looking out for just one thing
I'm only hoping that
You won't turn out like that
I need some time 'til I can make up my mind
Been hurt in love before
But I still come back for more
Was such a fool, I couldn't stop myself
If you believe in me
If you want our love to be
I know you'll wait for me, oh

[Chorus]
I've got to be, got to be certain
I've got to be so sure
I've had my share of hearts broken
And I don't wanna take that any more
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
I'm not asking for a love to last forever
I don't expect to get a guarantee
It's just that I believe
Lovers should stick together
I'm only saying, won't you wait for me?

[Chorus]
I've got to be, got to be certain
I've got to be so sure
I've had my share of hearts broken
And I don't wanna take that any more
I've got to be, got to be certain
I've got to be so sure
I've had my share of hearts broken
And I don't wanna take that any more
I've got to be, got to be certain
I've got to be so sure
I've had my share of hearts broken
And I don't wanna take that any more

[Intro]
Hold on tight, you got it
We will not be quiet
She cannot be silenced
Never doubt your power
Better ask about her
You don’t want no problems, no
Do you know who you are girl?
Lady you’re a goddess

[Verse 1]
Why you be pressing me, why you be nagging me
Why don’t you just back it up, I blow a bag
Buy you a back for against you possessive
Angry aggressive, always stay mad at me
Yeah I am the baddest bitch, only they savages
Them niggas challenged them so had to retaliate
I have his back so I picked up his slack for him
Though got to heavy now they call me masculine
Oh you gay, you must have been raped
Anything you can do I can too
You can’t get [?] thinking logical
No way that is not possible
Get out of line, I slapped the snot out of you
Give up the drugs, you’re a thot or a prostitute
Constantly doubting you
Lack of confidence from doubting you
You’re valuable girl, I’m so proud of you
You’re still smiling like the sky’s the bluest
Disguise and bruises, don’t know how you do it
Going through it, girl you got Adonis
You’re the truest, has more to offer than just making babies
Told to sit down and then act like a lady
Stay in your place, where is that exactly
Not in the kitchen cooking cleaning the dishes
So early not over your knee
Watch the way that you’re talking to me
Damn it all these double standards
Praise the man against the panics
No strings attached
Pump that pussy then that Plan B
I don’t want it, I won’t claim em
Bring they ass back, we didn’t plan it, who you been with?
I can’t stand ya, how you even know that I’m the dad?

[Bridge]
Hold on tight, you got it
We will not be quiet
She cannot be silenced
Never doubt your power
You better ask somebody
You don’t want no problems now
Do you know who you are girl?
Lady you are a goddess, you are a goddess
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Told her things
Sold her dreams
Offered her everything except a wedding ring
Planted seeds without watering
She never really blossomed fully, she was 17
Lies and infidelity
No promises, no expectancy
She’s expecting now
He was absent the whole pregnancy
Re-routed her destiny
She was on the right path
That post-partum hit her hard with the right jab
Stopped answering the calls, doesn’t write back
He was only interested in [?]
You know, a little nightcap
Oh I hurt you girl, my bad, I thought you like that
She just wants her life back
This is what happens when you bring her down, you take the crown
She’s taking downers, over counter, got her guard up
Out here wildin’, acting childish, bashing cars in
Can’t you see that she's scarred
She’s been enduring with a broken heart, my god
There is so much damage, you’re so demanding
Brought her closer then left her stranded
No closure, it’s open-ended
Co-dependent, incoherent, can’t compare it, loose cannon
Can hardly manage, feeling famished
Wishing she could vanish
Trying not to panic
Got to get established
Too late in the game
Still gonna take a stab at it
And desperately for change
I desire better for myself
That requires for me to start asking for some help
Taking baby steps, trying to do my best
Been tested, more than the rest, life ain’t fair, but I’m not upset
Reminded every day, I cannot forget
[?] and conquered out of shit

[Outro]
Hold on tight, you got it
We will not be quiet
She cannot be silenced
Never doubt your power
You better ask somebody
You don’t want no problems now
Do you know who you are girl?
Lady you are a goddess, you are a goddess

325,Shake Your Thang (It's Your Thing),A Salt With A Deadly Pepa,Salt-N-Pepa,1988-08-02,241573,39,"

(Ow, shake it!)
Yeah, oh, you're lookin' sweet, baby
Yes, indeedy
Funky (get down)

We was on a dancefloor shakin' our thing
To a funky beat with a go-go swing
Everyone was watching, they stared in shock
Amazed at how Salt and Pepa was rock-
In the place with a smile on my face
Some got upset and then tried to base
They called us nasty, said we danced dirty
Claimed we were freaks, cheap, even flirty
Pepa got pissed and pulled out a pump
I was all set not to jet but to jump
Spin broke it up and asked not to break
Said, ""They don't understand the way you...""

Shake your thang, oww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to

Shake that thing, C'mon, y'all, shake it
We could get loose, but we can't get naked
It's not a crime, it's legal, we answered
Look again - see? We're just dancin'
Relax a bit, now ain't that better?
I think it's time for you to get a...
Partner, doe-see, gather in closely
I wanna see the ones that mostly
Front on a cutie, hope you're not fruity
Do your duty and...

Shake your thang, oww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to

Come on, y'all, shake that thing
You got to just show no shame
I want you to shake that thing
Come on, y'all, show no shame

Shake your thang, yeah yeah
Oh, you're lookin' sweet, baby
Owww, I won't tell you how to catch a groove

It's my thing, and I'll swing it the way that I feel
With a little seduction and some sex appeal
It's Friday night, and I just got paid
I'm checking out the fella with the high-top fade
Moving in closely, ready for the kill
Steppin' on a dancefloor, think you're ill
But if I guy touch my body I just put him in check
I said, ""We just met"", ""We can't do that yet""
I'm not a pick-up (no), this ain't a stick up (boy)
I'm not stuck up (yeah), and turn to kick up
And just rock, baby-pop, don't stop
Stick out your butt, and shake what you got

Shake your thang, oww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to

Ooh, I like hip-hop mixin' with go-go, baby
It's my thing, and I shake it crazy
Don't try and tell me how to party
It's my dance, yup, and it's my body
The shirt I wear may be low cut
My jeans fit nice, it shows off my butt
Designer down from head to toe
Oooo, my hair, neck, and fingers is crazy-glow
Now please stop blushin', we're just dancing, dummy
C'mon, we both know I don't want you for your money
Cuz we like to rap so we always rhyme
I like to dance, ooh, and I like to grind
I like this song, I like this beat
I'll see you later, where shall we...

Shake your thang, oww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to

Instead of dope beats, he was spinnin them Z's
All the fly girls who came with a beat in mind

Your party is bogus, Yo it ain't legit

Now I'm your big maul dropper, mud duck stopper
Fila on the bottom and Adidas on the topper
Transform scratching, big beat matching
I can tell you're getting jealous by the look I'm catching
I hate dumb skeezers, MC beater
Dropped 5 grand on my Bird wattmeter
Smooth like ice, don't get nice
Just turn up the box for the Mix-A-Lot slice (huh huh)

Y'all ready to get busy? (huh huh!)
Now, buttermilk biscuits here we go
Sift the flour roll the dough
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
Move your butt to the funky beat (huh huh)

Buttermilk biscuits (x 3)
(Lord have mercy Mix-A-Lot's got me rapping about biscuits now)

Freak from L.A. to the Carolinas
Dip them suckers in Aunt Jemima
Don't make a difference what food you make
Use buttermilk biscuits to clean your plate
You eat 'em in the morn', you eat 'em at night
Kentucky Fried Chicken makes the suckers just right
I am eat 'em with jelly at my favorite deli
Wrapped and sealed by a freak named Shelley (huh huh)

Buttermilk biscuits (x 3)

One day I kissed my freak, hit the street
Looking for something to eat
In a 18-wheeler, looking real swass
All the girls smile cause I'm the big boss
Said I gotta eat now, can't eat later
Made a lot of noise to attract my waiter
The boy walked up, and what did he say?
""Say, buttermilk biscuits free today!""
So what you waiting on boy?  Get up shake a leg
Gimme ten of them suckers with grits and eggs
Glass of Koolaid and a whole stick of butter
Them biscuits make me a super fast cutter (huh huh)

Now grab that can and wrap it in your hand
Bang that sucker 'til the dough expand
Put them suckers off in your oven
Grab your girlie and get a little lovin'
Add a dab of honey if you want to get funny
Microwave the suckers if you want your honey runny
Kind of get naughty at the Mix-A-Lot party
And rub them suckers all over your body (huh huh)

What would I have to do
To get you to notice me too
Do I stand in line
One of a million admiring eyes

Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky

I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so baby
When I get my hands on you, I won't let go
This time I know it's for real

Should I write or call your home
Shout it out with a megaphone
Radio, TV news
Got to find a way to get the message to you

Say I love you with a neon sign
Anything to make you mine

I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I wait too long for you, I might explode
I've been around the block enough to know
This time I know it's for real
Ooo, baby
This time, this time......
This time, this time......
Ooo, baby
This time, this time......
Ooo, baby

Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky

I don't know why I said the things I said
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you, you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time

[Verse 2]
My world was shattered, I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
When you walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything, darlin', then and there

[Pre-Chorus]
Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind and darlin'

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that've hurt you and you'd stay
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do

[Bridge]
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
(If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time
Oh, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't wanna see you go
I know I made you cry, but

[Chorus]
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars, I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time, if I could find a way
And maybe, maybe, maybe you'd stay
If I could reach the stars

[Verse 1]
I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire
You come to me, come to me, wild and wild
When you come to me, give me everything I need
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong, baby

[Chorus]
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart? No, no!
Baby, I would rather be dead

[Verse 2]
In your heart I see the start of every night and every day
In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place

[Chorus]
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart? No, no!
Baby, I would rather be dead

Each time you leave me I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
I can feel you even when I'm alone
Oh, baby, don't let go

You're the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone, anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart? No, no!

I hear a wind
Whistling air
Whispering in my ear

Boy mercury shooting through every degree
Oh girl dancing down those dirty and dusty trails
Take it hip to hip rocking through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Skip the air-strip to the sunset
Yeah ride the arrow to the target
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without anything but the love we feel

Fly the great big sky see the great big sea
Kick through continents bustin' boundaries
Take it hip to hip rock it through the wilderness
Around the world the trip begins with a kiss

Roam if you want to, roam around the world
Roam if you want to, without wings without wheels
Roam if you want to, roam around the world

Ouch!!
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce the high hat
Go on, mmmm, that's good!
Now the tambourine, right now!
Mmmm, woo, yeah, DJ!

[Verse 1]
Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
And the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

Gigolo
Huh, sukka?
Gigolo. Gigolo
Huh, sukka?

We do the dive every time we dance
I'll give you love baby not romance
I'll make a move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

Get funky
Yeah Timmy
Tell it like it is!
Check out this DJ

[Verse 2]
So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny
When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy
But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile
Committed a crime and went inside
It was coming your way but you had to survive
When you lost your babe, you lost the race
Now you're looking at me to take her place

[Pre-Chorus]
Who's looking good today?
Who's looking good in ever way?
No style rookie
You better watch don't mess with me

No moneyman can win my love

So don't you get fresh with me

Smokin' not cokin'
Get funky sax
Looking good, hang in with the Wild Bunch
Looking good in a Buffalo Stance
Looking good when it comes to the crunch
Looking good's a state of mind
State of mind don't look behind you
State of mind or you'll be dead
State of mind may I remind you
Bomb the Bass, rock this place!

Yo man what do you expect the guy's a gigolo man

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no

To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne

You win and you lose some
But if you stay in the game

You'll feel the fire
But don't get burned by the flame
You'll find the answer any day
With every beat of my heart
I keep getting closer to you
With every beat of my heart now
I know we're getting closer
To love with every beat
I just wanna know you
More every day
And now it won't be long
Till I hear you say (say it, say it)
Say that you do boy
It's just a matter of time
Before you know it
You'll feel the fire
And it's burning deep inside
You'll find the answer
In his eyes

On ways of living such a dangerous life

You'll do anything if given a chance
Scheming, planning lies to get what you need
So full of promises that you never keep

Sick and tired of all of your games
And you want me to stay, ah, better change

So I said, can't you wait a bit longer
I'll give you all that a lover should give
It ain't my pride but my love that is stronger
I'd be hurt; I'd be hurt, if you walk away

Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many dreams can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you

Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many dreams can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you

You give me one good reason to leave me
I'll give you ten good reasons to stay
You're the only one I believe in
I'd be hurt; I'd be hurt, if you walked away

Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many dreams can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you

[Verse 1]
Let me take you to a place I know you want to go
It's a good life
I wanna stand around and beg you
Just don't say no
No, no
No, no

I have got a feeling that you're gonna like it
What I'm doing to you
And I'm doing what I'm doing
I'll be doing what you want to me to do

[Chorus]
Love is shining
Life is thriving in the good life
Good life

[Verse 2]
A feeling that you get from the good life
Once you get that good life feeling
Let me tell you no one can take it away
No, no
No, no

[Chorus]
No more bad times
Only glad times in the good life
Good life

[Verse 3]
When the grooves are rocking nothing feels as good as a good life
I want you to want me
To want the good life all night

[Chorus]
No more rainy days
The sun will chase the clouds away
In the good life
Good life

No more sorrow
Nothing borrowed in the good life
Good life

And the whole world's living in a parking-lot
Bacause you know I'd be the guardian angel of our destiny

And the rain was falling in the papercup
Because you
Girl and me
We'll climb the mountain of eternity
I love you - I love you !
You're the love of my life

And I won't let you go now
This is a requiem for: Love

Our love is a miracle now
Like a thief in the night
The night

I was begging for love
This is a requiem for; Life has set me free
Taking a chance on you and me

The burning fever that is guaranteed
To make you feel twice as nice
And light the magic in your angel-eyes
Just you
Girl
And me
The guardian angels of our destiny
And I love you - I love you !
You're the love of my life

And I won't let you go now. ...
You're the love of my life

{​*scratching*}​
""Go for mine,  and run down the line""
{​*scratching*}​
""Go for mine, and run down the line""

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I went from construction Timbs to Ac's with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's that superstar status apparatus, more wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline
I want a presidential Rollie (So)
So I crush MCs to guacamole, making Robin scream, ""Holy moley!""
Big Poppa, fuck a cape, I'm that Paper Crusader
Playing Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Verse 2: Coolio]
I shot dice with a priest and drank yak with a pastor
So it's me, myself and I know, my own lord and master
When your ass was born, it was all on the lone, and
When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

[Break 1: Easy Mo Bee]
{​*scratching*}​
""Go for mine,  and run down the line""
{​*scratching*}​
""Go for mine, and run down the line""

[Verse 3: Redman]
It's that Funkadelic Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the vest, niggas better start putting on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk coming in stacks, bullets humming from gats
So I duck, lyrical BUCK BUCK, get stuck
I'm jamming like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
BLADOW! Plus my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang, burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leaving your mic boney like that Tales Of The Crypt bitch (Uh!)
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, I'm busting your ass, counterclockwise
I get Dumb but Dumber, why your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo-ooh-sers

[Verse 4: Ill Al Skratch]
Ayo, Mayday, mayday, raise the white flag
Let the pants sag, fuck the drag (I'm a puff the whole bag)
It's the low down and I'm low-key, the O.G
Niggas know me (True) so take it easy with stakes

[Verse 5: Big Mike]
It ain't surprising these motherfuckers still hating
They must don't know I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike will stomp the head of a snake
Now quakes was felt when my feet hit the ground
And fate is fatal when my heat made a sound
Now, how did I relate what's gonna fall
When my niggas made the fucking final call

[Chorus: Ill Al Skratch]
It ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like that

[Break 2: Easy Mo Bee]
""For my one true""
""Our run's our rhyme""
""For my one""
{​*scratching*}​
""One true""
""For my one true""
""Our run""
""Our run""
""Run's""
""Our""
""Rhyme""

[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]
Hey, you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You best believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around, my people start subtracting
They cause this shit, then they wonder why we start overreacting
Hey, ay, ay, you can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'm a hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me go inside, ""Please give me room, yo step aside""
Ha, those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there dropping dimes
Get your shit drawers up out my hammer
Young survivalist represent the next Black Panther

[Verse 7: Buckshot]
I stepped in the jam with the guard on my side
And the guard S.T. is still waiting in the ride
So I stepped to the DJ and told the DJ
""Yo, throw the wax on"" ""How many emcees must get dissed""

[Verse 8: Layzie Bone]
Putting your shit to the pave, ending 'em meeting the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazing, nothing phased
Bone, my deadly fist of brothers, ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, you dearly departed, better off

[Verse 9: Wish Bone]
Living the psycho path so I'm down with a buck and a blast and getting my chance
You niggas are fearing my sawed-off
Blew thee to rest, so fast to blast
So if you, thinking defeat, you need, to best, be packing your shit, you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cuz, when we a done with the quickness

[Verse 10: Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, bucking em once a
Gain enough to pick a defender
They try to contend us, see, all they gon' win is that Mac-10
There's never another to go with a brother, while smotherin' suckas been gon' undercover
We leave em in gutters, ain’t gonna get caught. But who was the sucker that squealed on a murda?

[Verse 11: Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street, sweeper, better R.I.P. and pray
The bullet don't put in much work but I'm a sure, with, shot
Puttin' the bullets just where it hurts, and um
With a me tech'll slip up one on the popos, Bone, Bone
Better be nothing to me, you set up, wet up
Get 'em on the get up, Bone won't let up

MRS VERNON-WILLIAMS:
I am of the opinion that morals
Are what separate humans from swine
Everyone needs to have morals
Specifically... mine

It's one's duty to set an example
And to always comport oneself decently
A worthy endeavor at which I failed NEVER!
Well, not recently

For you see...

I did something wrong, once
One tiny thing wrong, once
A small indiscretion
A minor transgression
I blundered a tad
Told a little white lie
Just a scooch off the truth
But it did lead to heartache
And that was...uncouth

Yes, I did something wrong, once
One teensy thing wrong, once
It was somewhat unseemly
Not somewhat extremely
And rather lowbrow
Yes, I confess, I did something wrong, once
Is it too late to make it right now?

My life overall has been blameless
As I scan it few faults do I find
Why even those three months with Hitler...
Never mind

The point is I've been through my closet
And that closet has only one skeleton
One breach of decorum waiting a forum
To tell it in

For I did something wrong, once
One itsy bitsy thing wrong, once
Showed a slight lack of candor
All right it was slander
All right it was bad
It was shameful, amoral
Disgraceful, unlawful
Look, I'll be blunt
It was just friggin' awful

Yes, I did something wrong, once
Just egregiously wrong, once
You may think I'm self-righteous
The truth is I might just be
Un-holier-than-thou
Okay, one might say
I did something wrong, once
But perhaps I can make it right now

I wrestled with my conscience
For it knew that I had sinned
I wrestled with my conscience
I got pinned! I got pinned!

Now I'm haunted with the memories
Of the pain I put people through
I'm haunted by the memories
They say boo, they say boo, they say boooo!

I'm regrettably of the opinion
That I've not merely broken the law
But in causing the death of two innocent people
And thus leaving their son as an orphan who lives in a bottomless cesspool of stigma
I've made a faux pas

All my life I've been seen as a beacon
High society's shining epitome
But now the opinions of matrons and minions
Mean shit to me

Yes, I did something wrong, once
Just repulsively wrong, once
But I'm tired of seeing
This stain on my being
It's driving me mad!
So today I'm off on a mission
I call it Operation Contrition
And I'm making this vow
I'll complete it somehow

This is it
I admit I did something wrong, once
But I'm going to right it
Right now

CRYBABY:
The stars up above, shine their light on our love
And the night just like us is still young
And it's long and its slow, and I need to know
Girl can I kiss you with tongue?

It's moist, and its pink
It's a muscle, I think
It's as smooth as the blanket I brung

But it lives all alone, with no friends of it's own
Girl can I kiss you with tongue?

I've been cursed (I've been cursed)
With a thirst (With a thirst)
No one else (No one else)
Can quite quench (oooh)

If you're shy  (If you're shy)
I'll stay dry (I'll stay dry)
So, what do you say? S'il vous plaît?
Can I parlez-vous some French?

It can swish, it can swirl
It can twist, it can curl
It can tickle the top of your lung

Yes, I just want to show
How deep love can go
Girl can I kiss you with tongue?

Now your'e mine (Now your'e mine)
And I pine (And I pine)
To taste you, tasting me

My mouth's open wide
Take a chance, come inside
Do it quick, now my song's almost sung

Darlin'
You can be sure, my saliva is pure

ALLISON & CRYBABY:
Now that I've kissed you
I can't resist you!

CRYBABY:
Now that I've kissed you

ALL:
With tongue!
