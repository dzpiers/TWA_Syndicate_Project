[Verse 1]
You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

[Verse 2]
Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, let's forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of

[Verse 3]
Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
C'mon over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Why should we be apart?
I really love you, baby, cross my heart

[Verse 4]
Let's walk up to the preacher
And let us say ""I do""
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of

[Verse 5]
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of

1,Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,The Best Of The Platters,The Platters,1995-01-01,157293,0,"

They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies

Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Smoke gets in your eyes!

On Blueberry Hill, when I found you

6,Mack the Knife,That's All,Bobby Darin,1959,184333,60,"

Oh the shark, babe
Has such teeth, dear
And he shows them
Pearly white
Just a jackknife
Has old Macheath, babe
And he keeps it
Out of sight

You know when that shark bites
With his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows
Start to spread
Fancy gloves, though
Wears ol' Macheath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

Now, on the side walk, ooh Sunday morning, uh huh
Lies a body just oozing life. EEK!
And someone's sneaking round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat down by the river, don't you know
Where a cement bag's just a drooping on down
Oh that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten, ol' Mackie's back in town

Now did ya hear 'bout Louie Miller?
He disappeared, babe
After drawing out all his hard earned cash
And now Macheath spends, just like a sailor
Could it be, our boy's done something rash?

Now, Jenny Diver, Suky Tawdry
Oh, Miss Lotte Lenya, and ol' Lucy Brown
Oh the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mackie's back in town

I said, Jenny Diver, oh Suky Tawdry
Look out, Miss Lotte Lenya, and ol' Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Mackie's back in town
Look out ol' Mackie is back!

Help the homeless!
Help the homeless!
Ooh! Hey Princeton!

Give me a quarter!
Here in my hat!
Come on, Princeton!
It's as easy as that!
Helping others brings you
Closer to God
So give me a quarter

[Princeton]
I don't have any change

[Nicky]
Hmmm... okay
Give me a dollar

[Princeton]
That's not what I meant

[Nicky]
Give me a five

[Princeton]
Are you kidding?

[Nicky]
The more you give
The more you get
That's being alive!
All I'm asking you
Is to do what
Jesus Christ would do
He'd give me a quarter
Why don't you?

[Princeton]
All right, all right, here you go

[Nicky]
Ahh, thanks!

[Princeton]
Take care
Whoa!

[Nicky]
What's the matter?

[Princeton]
I feel generous!
I feel compassionate!

[Nicky]
You do?

[Princeton]
Yeah! I feel like a new person—a good person!
Helping other people out makes you feel fantastic!

[Nicky]
That's what I've been trying to tell you—

[Princeton]
All this time I've been running around thinking
About me, me, me—and where has it gotten me!
I'm gonna do something for someone else!

[Nicky:]
Me?

[Princeton]
No—Kate! I'm going to raise the money to build that
Stupid Monster School she's always talking about!
Give me your money!

What?

I need it for Kate!

[Nicky]
I need it to eat!

Come on, Nicky!

Aww, get lost!

[Princeton]
It'll make you feel great!

So would a burger!

When her dream comes true
It'll all be partly
Thanks to you
So give me your money!

I'd like to, but I can't

Give me your money!

I can't! I need it! I'm homeless!
Okay, here you go

[Princeton]
Thank you!

[Nicky]
Suddenly
I am feeling
Closer to God
It's time to stop begging
It's time to start giving!
What can I give to Rod?
Something he'll like so much he'll take me back
Ooh, I know! I'll find him a boyfriend!

You can't help helping yourself!

Your chances with Kate

For a Monster School

Got money to burn

And it's not like money
That you had to earn

Sounds like a good cause

[Christmas Eve]
Give me your wallet

Oh my gosh! I don't know how to thank you guys
I mean, Kate will be so grateful!
That kind of money is such a great start

[Gary Coleman]
Yeah, $15

[Princeton]
$15?

[Christmas Eve]
Every little bit help

[Nicky]
Looks like we're gonna have to ask more people!

[All]
Hey!
Give us your money!
All that you've got!
Just fork it on over

[Gary Coleman]
Or some puppets
Will get shot!

[Princeton]
Hey!

[All]
It's time to pass the hat

[Gary Coleman]
And there's nothing you can do 'bout that

[All]
So give us your money!
Give us your money!
Give us your money!
When you help others
You can't help helping yourself!
When you help others
You can't help helping yourself!
Every time you
Do good deeds
You're also serving
Your own needs
When you help others
You can't help helping yourself!
When you give
To a worthy cause
You'll feel as jolly
As Santa Claus
When you help others
You can't
Help
Helping yourself!

9,Johnny B. Goode,Berry Is On Top,Chuck Berry,1959-01-01,161560,0,"

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go
Go go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for me
My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'd go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
We'll meet (I know we'll meet) beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

No more sailing
So long sailing
Bye, bye sailing...

23,I Get A Kick Out Of You,Sinatra And Swingin' Brass,Frank Sinatra,1962-07,194093,54,"

My story is much to sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
You give me a boot
I get a kick out of you

Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle

Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears

Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me

Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
Watch the jungle when it's wet with rain
But remember darling, till you're home again

And the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark

It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven
Billy swore that he threw eight

Stagger Lee told Billy
""I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money
And my brand new Stetson hat.""

Stagger Lee started off
Goin down that railroad track
He said, I can't get you Billy
But don't be here when I come back

Go on, Stagger Lee

Stagger Lee went home
And he got his .44
Said, ""I'm going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt I owe.""

Stagger Lee went to the bar room
And he stood across the bar room door
Said, ""Now nobody move.""
And he pulled his .44

""Stagger Lee,"" cried Billy
""Oh, please don't take my life

And a very sickly wife.""

Oh he shot that poor boy so bad
Till the bullet came through Billy
And it broke the bartender's glass

We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way

Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you

I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I caught the rolling arthritis
Sitting down at a rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
They rocking in two by two

[Bridge]
Well, if you feel and like it
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it
Roll it over then move on up just
A trifle further and reel and rock with
One another
Roll over Beethoven
Dig these rhythm and blues

[Verse 4]
Well, early in the morning I'm giving you my warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle, I'ma play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 5]
You know she wiggle like a glow worm
Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner
You oughta see him reel and rock
Long as she got a dime, the music won't never stop

Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues

I. “Stay Awake”
[Verse 1]
Stay awake, don’t rest your head
Don’t lie down upon your bed
While the moon drifts in the skies
Stay awake, don’t close your eyes

[Verse 2]
Though the world is fast asleep
Though your pillow’s soft and deep
You’re not sleepy as you seem
Stay awake, don’t nod and dream
Stay awake, don’t nod and dream

Shades of night are falling
As the wind begins to sigh
And the world is silhouetted
'Gainst the sky

Blue shadows on the trail
Blue moon shining through the trees
And a plaintive wail from the distance
Comes a-drifting on the evening breeze

[Chorus]
Move along, blue shadows, move along
Soon the dawn will come
And you’ll be on your way
But until the darkness sheds its veil
There’ll be blue shadows on the trail

[Chorus 2]
Move along, blue shadows, move along
Soon the dawn will come
And you’ll be on your way
But until the darkness sheds its veil
There’ll be blue shadows
Blue, blue shadows
There’ll be blue, blue shadows

Well, I've been doin' my homework all week long
And now the house is empty and the folks are gone
Hooo! C'mon, everybody!

Ah well, my baby's number one, but I'm gonna dance with three or four
And the house'll be a-shakin' from the bare feet a-slappin' on the floor
Well, when you hear that music you can't sit still
If your brother won't rock then your sister will
Hooo! C'mon, everybody!

Well, we'll really have a party, but we gotta put a guard outside
If my folks come a-home, I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide

No more runnin' round with the usual crew

No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe

My hopes, my dreams come true
My life I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything

My heart I can't control
You rule my very soul

68,Fever,The Capitol Years,Peggy Lee,1988-01-01,201333,58,"

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm going to treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her he said
Julie Baby, you're my flame
Thou giveth fever
When we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yeah I burn, forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him
She said, Daddy, oh don't you dare
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his missus
Daddy won't you treat him right?

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever, if you live you learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I have no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a-wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks, they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' homebrew from a wooden cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up

And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep a-rockin' that piano

So I can hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me

Out in the moonlight just like we used to do

I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of saying, I love you
I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you

Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walking after midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be somewhere walking
After midnight searching for me

[MORGAN (spoken)]
One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods...

[ANNIE (spoken)]
Jack, hurry up! Come on!

[JACK (spoken)]
Just a second. Sugar maple...

[MORGAN (sung)]
On a day just like any other

[ANNIE]
What're you doing?

[JACK]
Making notes. Rough bark...

[MORGAN]
In the woods not very far from home

[ANNIE]
Jack! I'm a monster!

[JACK]
Star-shaped leaves...

[MORGAN]
As they walk, a sister and brother...

[ANNIE]
Grrrrrr!!!

[JACK]
Annie, cut it out!

[ANNIE]
Oh, come on, Jack! Play with me!

[MORGAN]
Argue

[JACK]
No! I'm too old to play pretend

[ANNIE]
No you're not!

[JACK]
Yes I am!

[ANNIE]
Are not!

[JACK]
Am too!

[MORGAN]
But today what they say doesn't matter

[ANNIE]
Jack, it's not pretend! I'm a monster!

[MORGAN]
For today in the woods they're not alone

[ANNIE]
Jack, look!

[JACK]
Annie, stop!

[MORGAN]
Today at the top of a ladder

[ANNIE]
No, really! Look!

[JACK]
Where?

[ANNIE]
Over there!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[MORGAN]
There's a magic place where wishes can come true

How far can you see

[ANNIE]
I'm climbing up!

[JACK]
Annie, don't! We don't know who it belongs to!

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[JACK]
Annie!

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
What?

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[ANNIE]
It's full of books!

[JACK]
Really?

[ANNIE]
Yes! Look!

[MORGAN]
When you venture outside your window

[ANNIE]
Books about knights! Ninjas! And...oh, wow!

[JACK]
What?

[ANNIE]
Dinosaurs!

[JACK]
Hold on, I'm coming up!

[ANNIE (sung)
Books about faraway places
Pictures of wondrous sights to see

[MORGAN]
To go there, all that it takes is wishing

[ANNIE (spoken)]
See?

[MORGAN]
A wish to have an adventure

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[MORGAN]
A wish from the top of a tree

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[MORGAN]
A wish to be there -- and then you're flying

[JACK]
I've never seen so many books in my life!

[MORGAN]
How far can you see

[JACK]
Look at that! Polar bears!

[ANNIE]
Awwww...

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[ANNIE]
And look at this one! It's all about pirates!

[JACK]
Let me see that!

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[JACK]
Pyramids!

[ANNIE]
Pilgrims!

[JACK]
Planets!

[MORGAN]
When you venture outside your window

[JACK]
Prehistoric pterodactyls!

[ANNIE]
What?

[JACK]
Dinosaurs!

[ANNIE]
Oh, right

[JACK]
Oh, man. This is amazing. I really wish we could go there...

(The Tree House spins)

[JACK and ANNIE]
AIEEEEEEE!!!

[ANNIE]
What happened?

[JACK]
I...I don't know

[ANNIE]
Where are we?

[JACK]
It...it looks like the picture in the book

[ANNIE]
Yeah, *exactly* like it

[JACK]
There's the palm tree...

[ANNIE]
There's the volcano...

[JACK and ANNIE]
AND THERE'S THE DINOSAURS!!!

[ANNIE]
Let's go!

[JACK]
Annie, wait!

[ANNIE]
Come on, I want to pet a dinosaur!

[JACK]
How're we going to get home?

[ANNIE]
We can worry about that later! Come on!

[JACK]
Annie, wait! I'm coming!

[MORGAN (spoken)]
That day, Jack and Annie discovered that the Tree House is magic -- and later they found out that it belongs to me, Morgan le Fay, of Camelot. Since that first day in the woods, they have had many wondrous adventures...and we have become friends...

[ANNIE]
Morgan! Hi!

[MORGAN]
Welcome back! Did you have fun?

[JACK]
Yep. We did

[ANNIE]
And look what we brought you!

[JACK]
It's a mango! From a rainforest!

[ANNIE]
And a moonstone! From a real ninja!

[JACK]
And look! A mammoth bone from the Ice Age!

[ANNIE]
This is the best summer we've ever had!

[JACK and ANNIE (sung)]
We saw dinosaurs before dark

[JACK]
A knight at dawn

[ANNIE]
We only had to make a wish

[JACK]
And whoosh! We were gone!
To visit mummies in the morning

[ANNIE]
Sail with pirates past noon

[JACK and ANNIE]
We're going out for a minute, Mom
We'll be home soon!

[JACK]
After a night of ninjas
Back in old Japan

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[ANNIE]
Or an afternoon on the Amazon

[JACK]
With crocodiles and monkeys and a big python!

[ANNIE]
Yikes!

[JACK]
We might set out through the ice and snow

[ANNIE]
To see the sun set on a sabertooth
A million years ago

[JACK and ANNIE]
Or maybe even travel
Far above the world we know
Arrive at midnight on the moon
And watch the earth revolve below!

In the Tree House there's no limit
If we wish it when we're in it
And the magic starts to spin it
There's no limit, just no limit
There's no limit to the places we can go!

[MORGAN (sung)]
How far can you see

[ANNIE]
My brother and me

[JACK]
My sister and me

From the top of a tree?

[ANNIE]
From the top of a tree?

[JACK]
From the top of a tree?

Yeah! And visiting the tigers, and the kangaroos...

[JACK]
And the gorillas!

Sailing on the Titanic!

The ghost town was scary, too

A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
And the straw boss said, ""Well-a bless my soul!""

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Oh now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Paddy And The Whale
PADDY AND THE WHALE

Paddy O'Brian left Ireland in glee;
He had a strong notion old England to see;
He shipped in the Nellie, for England was bound
And the whiskey he drank made his head go around

Cho: Laddy whack, fol de dol, fol de rol I dee dee *

O, Paddy been never sailing before;
It made his heart ache when he heard the loud roar;
For the glance of his eye, a whale he did spy:
""I'm going to be ate,"" says Paddy,""by-and-by""

O, Paddy run forward and caught hold of the mast
He grasped his arms round and there he held fast
The boat gave a tip, and, losing his grip
Down in the whale's belly poor Paddy did slip

He was down in the whale six months and five days
Till luck one day to his throat he did pop
The whale give a snort and then give a blow
And out on the land poor Paddy did go

O, Paddy is landed and safe on the shore;
He swears that he 'll never go to sea any more
The next time he wishes old England to see
It will be when the railroad runs over the sea

They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies

Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
(Smoke gets in your eyes)
Smoke gets in your eyes!

If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

Watch the sun rise on a tropic isle

Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me

Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
Watch the jungle when it's wet with rain

And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another for I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

[Bridge]
Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughin' and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown

Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow
Who's sad and blue
Who's crying too
Just like I cried over you

Right to the end
Just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way
Now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now

Hey, Venus!
Oh, Venus!

Venus, if you will
Please send a little girl for me to thrill
A girl who wants my kisses and my arms
A girl with all the charms of you

Venus, make her fair
A lovely girl with sunlight in her hair
And take the brightest stars up in the skies
And place them in her eyes for me

Venus, goddess of love that you are
Surely the things I ask
Can't be too great a task

Venus, if you do
I promise that I always will be true
I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall live

Just walking in the rain
Getting soaking wet
Torturing my heart
By trying to forget

Just walking in the rain
So alone and blue
All because my heart
Still remembers you

People come to their windows
They always stare at me
Shaking their heads in sorrow
Saying, ""Who can that fool be?""

Just walking in the rain
Thinking how we met
Knowing things could change
Somehow I can't forget

People come to their windows
They always stare at me
Their shaking their heads in sorrow
Saying, ""Who can that fool be?""

Just walking in the rain
Thinking how we met
Knowing things could change
Somehow I can't forget

Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is ""La vie en rose""
When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see ""La vie en rose""

[Verse 2]
When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom
And when you speak, angels sing from above
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?

Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there

Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

On a day like today
We passed the time away
Writing love letters in the sand

How you laughed when I cried
Each time I saw the tide
Take our love letters from the sand

You made a vow that you would ever be true
But somehow that vow meant nothing to you

Now my broken heart aches
With every wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand

Now my broken heart aches
With every wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand

What good would it do?
For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize

I'll never thrill again
To somebody new
Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you

And if a shooting star goes by

Graduation's almost here, my love

And if an astronaut zooms by

Some wish to be a king or a queen
Some wish for fortune and fame
But to be, truly, truly, truly loved is
More than all of these things

To be loved, to be loved, to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved

Greeting earthlings
We have now taken over your radio

[Chorus: Method Man]
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Going straight to the Hole, you ain't got no game
I'm breaking ya out the frame, coming through like a train
Looking to take over the whole world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew taking over control
You can't get none of this, we're running this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunning this
Get out the lane, I'm coming through
And if you don't wanna move I'm coming right through you

[Verse 2: Coolio]
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust, now your whole crew is dust
Coming through my area, I'ma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your stream scene
It's like showdown on the rango tell me who wanna tangle
With the ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real & Method Man]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (before)

[Chorus: Method Man]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Insane like a runaway train, I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed—ah—, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange megalomaniacal
Monster in the game and I got my eye on you
Dead shot aim as free throws keep coming
Down like rain, you feeling me, I'm feeling you
The Monstar again, I'm telling you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do, my tactics
Is unsportsmanlike conduct, you better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift?
You get stripped by Ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer
Danger you're dealing with official hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Uh, lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the Rim, finessing and moves is animated
Once I get to balling, I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is getting money
When clicks get to bugging, I'm snatching up their bunnies
Uh, every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shake you down
This is my planet, I'm 'bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness? (No doubt, uh)
My cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money or in it for the love
M.J.? 23 ways to make a pay
Lounging in the mothership back around my way, uh
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole
Am I getting lyrical? Daddy, I think so
Monstar dropping flavor fluid so drink slow

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real, Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (yeah, run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (ah, hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war, turn the music up, please!)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (ah, yah, before)

[Chorus: Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (we hit 'em high, high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (you hit 'em low, low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (we hit 'em high, high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (you hit 'em low, low)

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, God bless, pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed balling on the fast break just like the pony express
I'm gon' mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game, you and your team
Just need to back off, get off my block, give me the ball
I said it's my rock, I'm starting a line-up by getting y'all
To bring the livestock (hah), throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through, tell me what you really gon' do?
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams
Like crash cars, who do they be? They be the Monstars! (Whatchu talkin' about?!)

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real, Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore
(what is she talking about? hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (before)

[Chorus: Method Man]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods...

[ANNIE (spoken)]
Jack, hurry up! Come on!

[JACK (spoken)]
Just a second. Sugar maple...

[MORGAN (sung)]
On a day just like any other

[ANNIE]
What're you doing?

[JACK]
Making notes. Rough bark...

[MORGAN]
In the woods not very far from home

[ANNIE]
Jack! I'm a monster!

[JACK]
Star-shaped leaves...

[MORGAN]
As they walk, a sister and brother...

[ANNIE]
Grrrrrr!!!

[JACK]
Annie, cut it out!

[ANNIE]
Oh, come on, Jack! Play with me!

But today what they say doesn't matter

Where?

There's a magic place where wishes can come true

How far can you see

[ANNIE]
I'm climbing up!

Annie, don't! We don't know who it belongs to!

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[JACK]
What?

[ANNIE]
Dinosaurs!

[JACK]
Hold on, I'm coming up!

[ANNIE (sung)
Books about faraway places
Pictures of wondrous sights to see

[MORGAN]
To go there, all that it takes is wishing

[ANNIE (spoken)]
See?

[MORGAN]
A wish to have an adventure

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[MORGAN]
A wish from the top of a tree

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
I...I don't know

That day, Jack and Annie discovered that the Tree House is magic -- and later they found out that it belongs to me, Morgan le Fay, of Camelot. Since that first day in the woods, they have had many wondrous adventures...and we have become friends...

Morgan! Hi!

[MORGAN]
Welcome back! Did you have fun?

[JACK]
Yep. We did

[ANNIE]
And look what we brought you!

And a moonstone! From a real ninja!

[JACK]
And look! A mammoth bone from the Ice Age!

[ANNIE]
This is the best summer we've ever had!

[JACK and ANNIE (sung)]
We saw dinosaurs before dark

[JACK]
A knight at dawn

[ANNIE]
We only had to make a wish

[JACK]
And whoosh! We were gone!
To visit mummies in the morning

[ANNIE]
Sail with pirates past noon

[JACK and ANNIE]
We're going out for a minute, Mom
We'll be home soon!

[JACK]
After a night of ninjas
Back in old Japan

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[ANNIE]
Or an afternoon on the Amazon

[JACK]
With crocodiles and monkeys and a big python!

[ANNIE]
Yikes!

[JACK]
We might set out through the ice and snow

[ANNIE]
To see the sun set on a sabertooth
A million years ago

[JACK and ANNIE]
Or maybe even travel
Far above the world we know
Arrive at midnight on the moon
And watch the earth revolve below!

In the Tree House there's no limit
If we wish it when we're in it
And the magic starts to spin it
There's no limit, just no limit
There's no limit to the places we can go!

To you, I'm just a kid that you won't date
Why was I born too late?

Born too late to have a chance to win your love
Oh why, oh why was it my fate
To be born too late?

I see you walk with another
I wish it could be me
I long to hold you and kiss you
But I know it never can be

For I was

Born too late for you to care
Now my heart cries
Because your heart just couldn't wait
Why was I born too late?

A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Some one will come to show the way
I believe, I believe

I believe above the storm the smallest prayer
Will still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
I believe, I believe

I believe the lord in heaven he is my guide
My sins he'll hide
I believe on calvary that jesus died
That pierced side
I believe in death we'll part to rise again
And meet in heaven to that loud amen
Then I know why, I believe

A wish to be there -- and then you're flying

[JACK]
I've never seen so many books in my life!

How far can you see

[JACK]
Look at that! Polar bears!

What happened?

[JACK]
I...I don't know

[ANNIE]
Where are we?

That day, Jack and Annie discovered that the Tree House is magic -- and later they found out that it belongs to me, Morgan le Fay, of Camelot. Since that first day in the woods, they have had many wondrous adventures...and we have become friends...

[ANNIE]
Morgan! Hi!

Welcome back! Did you have fun?

A knight at dawn

We only had to make a wish

[JACK]
And whoosh! We were gone!
To visit mummies in the morning

[ANNIE]
Sail with pirates past noon

[JACK and ANNIE]
We're going out for a minute, Mom
We'll be home soon!

[JACK]
After a night of ninjas
Back in old Japan

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[ANNIE]
Or an afternoon on the Amazon

[JACK]
With crocodiles and monkeys and a big python!

[ANNIE]
Yikes!

[JACK]
We might set out through the ice and snow

[ANNIE]
To see the sun set on a sabertooth
A million years ago

[JACK and ANNIE]
Or maybe even travel
Far above the world we know
Arrive at midnight on the moon
And watch the earth revolve below!

In the Tree House there's no limit
If we wish it when we're in it
And the magic starts to spin it
There's no limit, just no limit
There's no limit to the places we can go!

There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away

To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears

120,Fever,Things Are Swingin',Peggy Lee,1959-05-04,199600,62,"

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm going to treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her he said
Julie Baby, you're my flame
Thou giveth fever
When we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yeah I burn, forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him
She said, Daddy, oh don't you dare
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his missus
Daddy won't you treat him right?

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever, if you live you learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

There stands the gate to paradise
But you don't hear the heart that cries
Outside of heaven

You're happy there with someone new
Good luck to him, good luck to you
I count the dreams that won't come true
Outside of heaven

On your wedding day I stood in the crowd
I could hardly keep from crying out loud
There goes the kiss my lips have known

There goes the love I called my own
Why was I meant to walk alone
Outside of heaven

Outside of heaven

Outside of heaven

On your wedding day I stood in the crowd
I could hardly keep from crying out loud
There goes the kiss my lips have known

There goes the love I called my own
Why was I meant to walk alone

Down in the Willow garden
Where me and my love did meet
As we sat a-courtin'
My love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of Burgundy wine
My love she did not know
So I poisoned that dear little girl
On the banks below

I drew a sabre through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
Which was a dreadful sign
My father often told me
That money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connolly

My father sits at his cabin door
Wiping his tear-dimmed eyes
For his only son soon shall walk
To yonder scaffold high
My race is run, beneath the sun
The scaffold now waits for me
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly

Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain

Today I'm a part of you dear
My lonely nights are through dear

Lord, what a difference a day made
Theres a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss;
That thrilling kiss

It's heaven when you
Find romance on your menu
What a difference a day made
And the difference is you

There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go
Go go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

Has such teeth, dear
And he shows them
Pearly white
Just a jackknife
Has old Macheath, babe
And he keeps it
Out of sight

You know when that shark bites
With his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows
Start to spread
Fancy gloves, though
Wears ol' Macheath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

Now, on the side walk, ooh Sunday morning, uh huh
Lies a body just oozing life. EEK!
And someone's sneaking round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat down by the river, don't you know
Where a cement bag's just a drooping on down
Oh that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten, ol' Mackie's back in town

Now did ya hear 'bout Louie Miller?
He disappeared, babe
After drawing out all his hard earned cash
And now Macheath spends, just like a sailor
Could it be, our boy's done something rash?

Now, Jenny Diver, Suky Tawdry
Oh, Miss Lotte Lenya, and ol' Lucy Brown
Oh the line forms on the right, babe

You gotta work late""

""Son, you gotta make some money
If you wanna use the car
To go a-ridin' next Sunday""

Cause you didn't work a lick""

Gonna have a fine vacation

My story is much to sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick
You give me a boot
I get a kick out of you

My lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailing

Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'd go sailing

It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon

We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
We'll meet (I know we'll meet) beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing

No more sailing
So long sailing
Bye, bye sailing...

What you gonna do when the well runs dry?
You're gonna sit right down and cry
What you gonna do when I say bye-bye
All you gonna do is dry your eye
I'm walkin', yes indeed and I'm talkin'
About you and me, I'm hopin'
That you'll come back to me

[Princeton]
Say, Kate, can I ask you a question?

[Kate]
Sure

[Princeton]
Well, you know Trekkie Monster upstairs?

[Kate]
Uh huh

[Princeton]
Well, he's Trekkie Monster, and you're Kate Monster

[Kate]
Right

[Princeton]
You're both Monsters

[Kate]
Yeah

[Princeton]
Are you two related?

[Kate]
What? Princeton! I'm surprised at you! I find that racist

[Princeton]
Oh, well, I'm sorry, I was just asking

[Kate]
Well, it's a touchy subject
No, not all monsters are related
What are you trying say, huh?
That we all look the same to you?
Huh, huh, huh?

[Princeton]
No, no, no, oh, not at all
I'm sorry, I guess that was a little racist

[Kate]
I should say so
You should be much more careful
When you're talking about the sensitive subject of race

[Princeton]
Well, look who's talking!

[Kate]
What do you mean?

[Princeton]
What about that special Monster school you told me about?

[Kate]
What about it?

[Princeton]
Well could someone like me go there?

[Kate]
No, we don't want people like you

[Princeton]
Ha ha ha ha ha, you see?
You're a little bit racist

[Kate]
Well, you're a little bit too

[Princeton]
I guess we're both a little bit racist

[Kate]
Admitting it is not an easy thing to do

[Princeton]
But I guess it's true

[Kate]
Between me and you

[Both]
I think everyone's a little bit racist sometimes
Doesn't mean we go around committing hate crimes
Look around and you will find
No one's really color blind
Maybe it's a fact we all should face
Everyone makes judgments based on race

[Princeton]
No, not big judgments, like who to hire
Or who to buy a newspaper from

[Kate]
No

[Princeton]
No, just little judgments like thinking that Mexican
Busboys should learn to speak goddamn English!

[Kate]
Right!

[Both]
Everyone's a little bit racist today
So, everyone's a little bit racist, okay
Ethnic jokes might be uncouth
But you laugh because they're based on truth
Don't take them as personal attacks
Everyone enjoys them, so relax

[Princeton]
All right, stop me if you've heard this one

[Kate]
Okay!

[Princeton]
Alright there's a plane going down
And there's only one parachute
And there's a rabbi, a priest

[Kate]
And a black guy!

[Gary]
Whatchoo talkin' 'bout Kate?

[Kate]
Uh....

[Gary]
You were telling a black joke

[Princeton]
Well, sure, Gary, but lots of people tell black jokes

[Gary]
I don't!

[Princeton]
Well, of course you don't—you're black
But I bet you tell Polack jokes, right?

[Gary]
Well, sure I do, those stupid Polacks, ha ha ha

[Princeton]
Now, don't you think that's a little racist?

[Gary]
Well damn, I guess you're right

[Kate]
You're a little bit racist

[Gary]
Well, you're a little bit too

[Princeton]
We're all a little bit racist!

[Gary]
I think that I would have to agree with you

[Kate & Princeton]
We're glad you do

[Gary]
It's sad but true
Everyone's a little bit racist, all right

[Kate]
All right

[Princeton]
All right

[Gary]
All right
Bigotry has never been
Exclusively white

[All]
If we all could just admit
That we are racist a little bit
Even though we all know that it's wrong
Maybe it would help us get along

[Princeton]
Oh, Christ, do I feel good?

[Gary]
Now there was a fine upstanding black man

[Princeton]
Who?

[Gary]
Jesus Christ

[Kate]
But, Gary, Jesus was white

[Gary]
No, Jesus was black

[Kate]
No, Jesus was white

[Gary]
No, I'm pretty sure Jesus was black

[Princeton]
Guys, guys, Jesus was Jewish

[Brian]
Hey guys, what are you laughing about?

[Gary]
Racism

[Brian]
Cool

Brian, come back here!
You take out lecycuraburs!

What's that mean?

[Brian]
Um, recyclables

[Kate, Princeton and Gary]
*laughter*

[Brian]
Hey, don't laugh at her
How many languages do you speak?

[Kate]
Oh, come off it, Brian
Everyone's a little bit racist

[Brian]
I'm not!

[Princeton]
Oh no?

[Brian]
Nope
How many Oriental wives
Have you got?

[Christmas Eve]
What? Brian!

[Princeton]
Brian, buddy, where you been?
The term is Asian-American

[Christmas Eve]
I know you are no intending to be
But calling me Oriental—offensive to me!

[Brian]
I'm sorry, honey, I love you

[Christmas Eve]
And I love you

[Brian]
But you're racist, too

[Christmas Eve]
Yeah, I know

The Jews have all the money
And the whites have all the power
And I'm always in taxi cab
With driver who no shower

[Kate]
Me too

[Princeton and possibly Brian]
Me too

[Gary]
I can't even get a taxi!

[All]
Everyone's a little bit racist, it's true
But everyone is just about as racist as you
If we all could just admit that we are racist a little bit
And everyone stopped being so PC
Maybe we could live in harmony

Well, when you hear that music you can't sit still
If your brother won't rock then your sister will
Hooo! C'mon, everybody!

Well, we'll really have a party, but we gotta put a guard outside
If my folks come a-home, I'm afraid they're gonna have my hide

Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started doing the things you used to do

[Verse 1]
As I was motorvatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a Coupe DeVille
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five
She's bumper to bumper rollin' side by side

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do

[Verse 2]
A Cadillac pulled up to one hundred and four
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It done got a cloud and started to rain
I tooted my horn for the passin' lane
The rain water blowin' all under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor good

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do

Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You done started back doing the things you used to do

[Verse 3]
The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill

[Chorus]
Maybellene, why can't you be true?
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You done started back doing the things you used to do

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She is my baby and she live next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She bring my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know I just love her so
She's my little woman waiting across town
Baby, I'm a little fool for you girl

[Verse 1]
Behold, Jehovah's prophets in the wilderness
Unfold the scroll, the contents of my syllabus
Everybody want the fast life, but fast life equals fast death
Where do you go after your last breath?
That's the question that we stressing
Expressions of reverence for your blessing
So check the lesson in the message
The message in the lesson will break the chains of addiction
The strains of affliction
Shackles of oppression
Our country go to war for money while the poor and hungry live in tabernacles of depression
Now we're here to expose the prince of the power of the air
Because the final hour it is near
And Satan might creep, so awake my peeps
From your late night sleep, gone astray like sheep
Don't wait too late and say ""I wish I knew then what I know now""
All I'm saying is ""slow down""

[Hook]
Slow down
You gotta slow down
Slow down
You gotta slow down

[Verse 2]
The radio refuse to play stuff like this
'Cause they're shady, so, they choose the unrighteous
They want your minds- vain guys long for power
Labels pay 'em to play the same five songs an hour
A lot ain't even hot: in fact
I heard the same song so many times, I almost forgot it was wack
When the same message is pumped repeatedly
Maybe not immediately; But sooner or later, the seed will be a tree
You're crazy if you think it don't affect the minds of the kids
When their favorite rapper be flossin' the diamonds and cribs
In their rhyming is fibs about grabbing techs to blast ya
But he's a slave: a record exec his master
One out of every four black males have been arrested
One out of every three females have been molested
You don't see the connection, you living on the surface
Why would you choose to be ignorant on purpose?
The light in this world is really dim
When 9 year old girls wanna grow up to be like Lil' Kim
14, eyes on the guy with the Range Rover
He ain't sober, she still believed the things he told her
Now he got a new lady, so for him it may be over
But for her it's just beginning, she's pushing a baby stroller
Saying,""I wish I knew then what I know now""
Somebody should have told her ""slow down""

[Hook]
Slow down
You gotta slow down
Slow down
You gotta slow down

[Verse 3]
As long as me and DJ Essence record new joints
Best believe, son, you're gonna get the Lord's viewpoint
Most won't feel it due to hardness of the heart
For light has come into the world but men love the dark
You don't have to show a child how to be disobedient
They already know how, they're wired to be deviant
What do you say about someone who dwells with fools?
And when did it become a bad thing to do well in school?
I guess because you failed you cool? That's absurdity
That's why you're allergic to what I fervently kick verbally
You know your mindstate is secular
When your eyes are dry while a sky high crime rate is regular
Extortion, pride, weed, abortion, lies, greed
Whores that got fees- the Lord is not pleased
Think about it logically
If God doesn't judge America, He owes Sodom and Gomorrah an apology
That's why Christ came to take the wrath and the pain
Laughs and the shame, on our behalf He was slain
Trust He's resurrected 'cause the sacrifice went well
And forever you'll be glad where the righteous dwell
Imagine spending half of your life in a cell
And die just to spend your afterlife in hell
Saying, ""I wish I knew then what I know now""
The whole time God was saying ""slow down""

[Hook]
Slow down
You gotta slow down
Slow down
You gotta slow down

[Bridge]
As the world goes around
People drown
In the evil that abounds
It's deep and profound
Media trying to drown out the sound
Of the Lord saying, ""Boys and girls- slow down""

[Hook]
Slow down
You gotta slow down
Slow down
You gotta slow down

Paddy And The Whale
PADDY AND THE WHALE

Paddy O'Brian left Ireland in glee;
He had a strong notion old England to see;
He shipped in the Nellie, for England was bound
And the whiskey he drank made his head go around

Cho: Laddy whack, fol de dol, fol de rol I dee dee *

O, Paddy been never sailing before;
It made his heart ache when he heard the loud roar;
For the glance of his eye, a whale he did spy:
""I'm going to be ate,"" says Paddy,""by-and-by""

O, Paddy run forward and caught hold of the mast
He grasped his arms round and there he held fast
The boat gave a tip, and, losing his grip
Down in the whale's belly poor Paddy did slip

He was down in the whale six months and five days
Till luck one day to his throat he did pop
The whale give a snort and then give a blow
And out on the land poor Paddy did go

O, Paddy is landed and safe on the shore;
He swears that he 'll never go to sea any more
The next time he wishes old England to see
It will be when the railroad runs over the sea

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I have no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she can hear my man a-wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurricane

If you wanna dance with me

Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks, they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' homebrew from a wooden cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up

And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to dig a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep a-rockin' that piano

So I can hear some of that rock and roll music

Come into my heart

Please say you'll never leave me
Well, say you never

Stupid cupid
You're a real mean guy
I'd like to clip your wings
So you can't fly
I'm in love
And it's a crying shame
And I know that you're the one to blame

Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me

I can't do my homework
And I can't think straight
I meet him every morning
'Bout a half past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool
You've even got me carrying his books to school

Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me

You mixed me up
But good
Right from the very start
Hey, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart

You've got me jumping
Like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're putting down
Since I kissed his loving lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine

Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me

You've got me jumping like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're putting down

Stop picking on me

Flying across the desert in a TWA
Saw me a woman walking across the sand
Walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay
To meet a brown eyed handsome man
Brown eyed handsome man

Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Brown eyed handsome man

Way back in history three thousand years
Back ever since the world began
There's been a whole lot of a shaking going on
Over a brown eyed handsome man
Brown eyed handsome man

Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get a brown eyed handsome man

Well, two, three the count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
He was rounding the third, he's headed for home
It was the brown eyed handsome man
Brown eyed handsome man, yeah

Yeah

My people left forsaken
I came to bless the nation
Where’s satan? Im God’s amazement of his own creation
Forever scarred still we grinding till this hunger starves us
We heartless with more heart than like 300 Spartans
This survivor’s genetics God is our witness
This shit David vs Goliath
We lions leave the giant bеheaded
We likе soldiers in the trenches here to defend
So we flood the streets like Azeris flood my DMs
So when a bunch of black G-wagons pulling up
Heat packing these cats got the streets backing turning up
Emcees lacking the talent and deep passion
Instead they just keep yappin’ Oh yes they indeed cappin’ sure enuf Ease back and just know we don’t be slacking
Relaxing
Sounding sharp as feedback when Mean rapping turn him up
Its simple mathematics
I’m better than 99. 999 % of these rappers

Word to Drizzy I’m a pop star and a doctor
Embody Kobe and Nipsey together
R Dash if I die tonight I live forever

Fighting for the Land of the Lost I pray that God with us
We united & we stand for the cause & never fall victim
I can’t believe what I be watching in awe Forgive me Lord I’ve been dreaming of the moment it’s ours
And never goes missing
I’ve been feeling like a minute man
I need a minute man
It’s been a minute many men been steady biting many hands The Richard Millie on my wrist been like a quarter million
I’m Milli Rocking on the beat & bill a condominium
On a chase for all this paper
I’m dodging all the fake ones
Truffle covered steak and caviar all on my plate uh
24 Gs up in my pocket from these 8ths uh
81 up on the board I’m feeling like a Laker
This for my brothers in arms we’re making history
When I heard the pressure is on don’t hope it get to me
Victimizing all of my people and it’s offending me
If I catch an Ottoman motherfucker I’ll catch a felony


[One-2]

I served a couple dimes and moved to real ounces
Served a little time with goons in jail houses
I’m from the block, Posted outside Little Caesar’s
I roam the streets like Julius Caesar in Rome
I’m a King, wear a crown of thorns made of barbed wire
Those who cross me get caught in the crossfire
Son of God, member of the lost tribe
Lived my whole life on the dark side
I hopped outta Noah’s Ark on Mt. Ararat
And walked alongside the Lord like Joan Of Arc
I’m like the Lion in our Coat Of Arms
Defiant, tho I came close to dying -
I’m still holding on
R told me to get ‘em
So I’mma hit ‘em til’ I got ‘em

Yeah I call the shots I say when
Put it on my name that Y-A-N
This one’s for my people, for my dear cusin
When you been through real pain you don’t fear nothing
We connected going hard all you bitches soft
Only female in the room who the biggest boss?
Had to take a break I went on a hiatus
Guess what now I’m back yelling hi haters!
Wish ‘em well wish ‘em well We don’t kiss and tell
Drippin’ in Chanel, Did that ring a bell”
Told your man please get to stepping but he trip and fell
So fly they call me heaven when I give ‘em hell



[BlackJack]

Represent cultures that never got their acknowledgement
One facing racists the other based on the politics
They brought the logic to slaughter taught by the Ottomans
So how we not gon’ pop when we Bishop beefing with Radomes God vs a Goblin-agnostic and we apostles
The prophets speaking the gospel that promise to breed the knowledge
In solace..breathe with the heart of our martyrs of modern massacres Masterminded by fascists that’s backed by a fucking bastard
A cabinet of fucking maggots that’s passive on all the havoc
That’s chanted that ‘All Life Matter’ now inactive with all that cappin’ So I’m speaking on that rare wave (ay) Fuck about no air play (ay)
I’m ridin' with my soldiers hollaring “Karabakh a merne”
Ain’t never been a fair play just open wounds and stolen borders Supported by thwarted orders forcing out the rightful owners
And the world's speaking volumes by staying silent
At the line of a genocide and you quiet based on alliance
And hiding behind a bias so whether Chump or it’s Biden
The government funds supplying the rockets you seen ‘em flying!
But the lion eating hyenas and rising above the demons
United fighting for freedom to silence the side of evil

This 40 blow the condiments up out your melon
They put me on the stand but i told em I ain’t telling
These bitches stick you up and use the pussy as a weapon
She got a Gucci bag with no cash or no credit
I’m turning tables
Double cross me you get crucified
I don’t need no Judas nah
Hit em with the Ruger, BYE
Smoking on my opp in this backwood when I’m gettin high
And tell my brothers out in Artsakh, let em fly
I wanna see dem bitches toe tagged
Taking out innocent kids they ain’t got no soul man
I’m sayin fuck AZ but not the rapper though
And fuck Gigi Hadid Bella Hadid and whoever backing them
We gon’ leave them opps looking holy like the motherland

You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
She's got a pad down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion Number Nine

I told her that I was a flop with chics
I've been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said ""What you need is Love Potion Number Nine""

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She said ""I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink""
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like Indian ink
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine

I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine

If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

Going straight to the Hole, you ain't got no game
I'm breaking ya out the frame, coming through like a train
Looking to take over the whole world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew taking over control
You can't get none of this, we're running this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunning this
Get out the lane, I'm coming through
And if you don't wanna move I'm coming right through you

[Verse 2: Coolio]
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust, now your whole crew is dust
Coming through my area, I'ma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your stream scene
It's like showdown on the rango tell me who wanna tangle
With the ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?

We're unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)

Insane like a runaway train, I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed—ah—, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange megalomaniacal
Monster in the game and I got my eye on you
Dead shot aim as free throws keep coming
Down like rain, you feeling me, I'm feeling you
The Monstar again, I'm telling you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do, my tactics
Is unsportsmanlike conduct, you better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift?
You get stripped by Ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer
Danger you're dealing with official hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Uh, lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the Rim, finessing and moves is animated
Once I get to balling, I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is getting money
When clicks get to bugging, I'm snatching up their bunnies
Uh, every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shake you down
This is my planet, I'm 'bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness? (No doubt, uh)
My cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money or in it for the love
M.J.? 23 ways to make a pay
Lounging in the mothership back around my way, uh
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole
Am I getting lyrical? Daddy, I think so
Monstar dropping flavor fluid so drink slow

If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (we hit 'em high, high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (you hit 'em low, low)

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, God bless, pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed balling on the fast break just like the pony express
I'm gon' mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game, you and your team
Just need to back off, get off my block, give me the ball
I said it's my rock, I'm starting a line-up by getting y'all
To bring the livestock (hah), throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through, tell me what you really gon' do?
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams
Like crash cars, who do they be? They be the Monstars! (Whatchu talkin' about?!)

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real, Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore
(what is she talking about? hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (before)

If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)

(The sweet, sweet memories you've given me
You can't beat the memories you've given me)

Take one fresh and tender kiss
Add one stolen night of bliss
One girl, one boy, some grief, some joy
Memories are made of this

Don't forget a small moonbeam
Fold it lightly with a dream
Your lips and mine, two sips of wine
Memories are made of this

Then add the wedding bells
One house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor

Stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays
These are the dreams you will savor

With His blessings from above
Serve it generously with love
One man, one wife, one love through life
Memories are made of this
Memories are made of this

My heart beats so joyfully
You'd think that he could hear

Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreamin' of
""Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love""

Whippoorwill, whippoorwill, you and I know
Tammy, Tammy can't let him go
The breeze from the bayou keeps murmuring low
""Tammy, Tammy, you love him so""

I long for his charms
I'd sing like a violin
If I were in his arms

Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of

Hide every trace of sadness

My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies

Baby, won't you give your love to me

[Princeton]
What do you do with a B.A. in English?
What is my life going to be?
Four years of college
And plenty of knowledge
Have earned me this useless degree!
I can't pay the bills yet
'Cause I have no skills yet
The world is a big scary place!
But somehow I can't shake
The feeling I might make
A difference to the human race!

[Kate]
Morning Brian!

[Brian]
Hi, Kate Monster

[Kate]
How's life?

[Brian]
Disappointing

[Kate]
What's the matter?

[Brian]
The catering company laid me off

[Kate]
Oh, I'm sorry

[Brian]
Me too! I mean, look at me!
I'm 10 years out of college
And I always thought...

[Kate]
What?

[Brian]
No, it sounds stupid

[Kate]
Oh, c'mon!

[Brian]
When I was little
I thought I would be

[Kate]
What?

[Brian]
A big comedian on late-night TV

[Kate]
Oh

[Brian]
But now I'm 32 and as you can see
I'm not

[Kate]
Nope

[Kate]
Your problems aren't so bad
I'm kinda pretty
And pretty damn smart

[Brian]
You are

I like romantic things like music and art
And as you know I have a gigantic heart
So why don't I have a boyfriend?

And we have lots of bills to pay!

Three coins in the fountain
Each one seeking happiness
Thrown by three hopeful lovers
Which one will the fountain bless

Three hearts in the fountain
Each heart longing for its home
There they lie in the fountain
Somewhere in the heart of Rome

Which one will the fountain bless
Which one will the fountain bless

Three coins in the fountain
Through the ripples how they shine
Just one wish will be granted
One heart will wear a valentine

Make it mine
Make it mine
Make it mine

Three coins in the fountain
Through the ripples how they shine
And just one wish will be granted
One heart will wear a valentine

Make it mine
Make it mine

Heavenly shades of night are falling
It's twilight time
Out of the mist your voice is calling
'Tis twilight time
When purple colored curtains
Mark the end of day
I'll hear you my dear at twilight time

Deepening shadows gather splendor
As day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender
The setting sun
I count the moments darling
'Till you're here with me
Together at last at twilight time

Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then

Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold
Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time

Here in the afterglow of day
We keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
Here in the sweet and same old way
I fall in love again as I did then

Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
Like days of old
Lighting the spark of love that fills me
With dreams untold

Each day I pray for evening just
To be with you
Together at last at twilight time
Together at last at twilight time

I was a big man yesterday but boy you oughta see me now
Well I talked big yesterday, but boy you oughta see me now
I bragged too long that your love was strong
There'd never be another guy
But you said more when you whispered your goodbye
I was a big man yesterday but boy you oughta see me now

I said that I was through with you
I didn't need you anyhow
I said I didn't need you then
But boy you oughta see me now

Those bragging words that you were mine
Of that there was no doubt
So empty now that half my life's walked out
Half my life left me yesterday
And boy you oughta see me now

If you will just forgive me dear
I'll never break another vow
I broke so many yesterday
And boy you oughta see me now

I couldn't see it yesterday
But now I know it's true
The only thing that made me big was you

I was a big man yesterday but boy you oughta see me now
If you could only see me now
You should see me now

You can gamble for match sticks, you can gamble for gold

Win or lose, I'm a moonlight gambler
And a winner is what I long to be
So I'll gamble for love just as long as I live
Till the day Lady Luck smiles down on me

Well, you can gamble for match sticks

That hastened at my call
But when I met that little girl
I knew that I would fall

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh

She played around and teased me
With her carefree devil eyes
She'd hold me close and kiss me
But her heart was full of lies

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

She told me how she cared for me
And that we'd never part
And so for the very first time
I gave away my heart

The next day she was gone
And I knew she'd lied to me
She left me with a broken heart
And won her victory

I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

Well, I'd played this game with other hearts
But I never thought I'd see
The day that someone else would play
Love's foolish game with me

Take my hand
I'm a stranger in Paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry eyed
That's a danger in Paradise
For mortals who stand beside
An angel like you
I saw your face
And I ascended
Out of the common place
Into the rarest somewhere in space
I hang suspended
Until I know
There's a chance that you care
Won't you answer this fervent prayer?
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms
To this stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more

Are you too much in love to hear
Is it all going in one ear and out the other

One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes she'll be there
You'll never be alone
And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine it can be yours my friend
So why don't you pretend

No one but you could take my heart before you came
No one but you could make my heart burst into flame
Now I hear myself confessing
All the dreams I've been suppressing
All at once my lips are blessing your name

Your hands are cool, your eyes are warm
Your smile is bliss
I'd be a fool to fear the storm that's in your kiss
Let your kiss destroy or save me, so shall it be
Till life is through, no one but you for me

CRY-BABY:
I’m just a little upset
I don’t mean to be rude
I’d hate to have my fury at the world be misconstrued
Just feel kinda bad
Ever so sad
I get that way when they take my girl and fry my mom and dad
But if you see me fuss and fret
Please don’t take it as a threat
It’s just sometimes I get a little upset

Yeah, I’ll just settle myself down a bit

Actually...
I’m still a little upset
Just a little bit irked
At this entire world around which I am getting jerked
I guess that I’m not
Feelin’ so hot
I must’ve woke up on thе wrong side of my rat-infested cot
How profoundly I rеgret
This entire tete-a-tete
It’s just sometimes I get a little upset

DUPREE:
‘Scuse me officer
I hate to bother you but

I’m also a little upset
Like my friend over here
A decade in the slammer isn’t great for my career
Good thing I’m mature
You can be sure
This is nothing that a full-scale prison riot wouldn’t cure
Now I’ve gone and broke a sweat
That’s what happens when you let
Yourself gradually get a little upset

I’m tryin’ to stay positive
I’m tryin’ not to frown
And I’m positive I’d smile if I could tear this prison down

CRY-BABY:
You say I’ll get out early
If I show you some repentance
But I ain’t never been too good at finishing a...

PRISONERS:
We’re just a little upset
Sounds hard to believe
But unjust incarceration is our number one pet peeve

GUARDS:
Don’t take it so hard
We’re standing guard
We wouldn’t want this place to leave you permanently scarred

CRY-BABY:
From the moment that we met
I’ve been deeply in your debt
For your patience when I get a little upset

CRY-BABY, DUPREE & PRISONERS:
Because brother you can bet
That you ain’t seen nothin’ yet
We’re about to pitch a fit
And by the time we’re through with it
You’ll be more than just a lit-tle upset

CRY-BABY:
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Carpe diem not incarceratum
Let’s escape our metal Dupree
... turn ‘em in Alcatraz

DUPREE:
No way

You are the girl of my dreams
Although I have met you just now
I'd tell you of my love somehow
If I could but win your heart little girl

The kisses you gave me in life's sweetest dreams
Are even more precious than gold
I love your sweet face and your dear smiling eyes
How often that story's been told
If I could but win your heart little girl

A beautiful woman, and a condemned man named Dong Dooley

I met her on the mountain, there I took her life
Met her on the mountain, stabbed her with my knife

Hang down your head, Dong Dooley
Hang down your head and cry (ah-uh-eye)
Hang down your head, Dong Dooley
Poor boy, you're bound to die

This time tomorrow reckon where I'll be

In a dream that's divine

With the world far away
And your lips close to mine

Tonight
While our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words

And the answer you give
May they still be the same
For as long as we live

The moment when your lips met mine
And that first exciting time
I held you close to me!

The sorrow in our love was breakin' up
The mem'ry of a broken heart –
An' later on, the joy of makin' up
Never, never more to part!

There's one thing left to do
Before my story's through
I've got to take you for my wife –
So the story of my life
Can start and end with you!

One summer day in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania, a mysterious tree house appeared in the woods...

[ANNIE (spoken)]
Jack, hurry up! Come on!

[JACK (spoken)]
Just a second. Sugar maple...

[MORGAN (sung)]
On a day just like any other

[ANNIE]
What're you doing?

[JACK]
Making notes. Rough bark...

[MORGAN]
In the woods not very far from home

[ANNIE]
Jack! I'm a monster!

[JACK]
Star-shaped leaves...

[MORGAN]
As they walk, a sister and brother...

[ANNIE]
Grrrrrr!!!

[JACK]
Annie, cut it out!

[ANNIE]
Oh, come on, Jack! Play with me!

Argue

No! I'm too old to play pretend

No you're not!

Are not!

Am too!

But today what they say doesn't matter

Where?

Over there!

There's a magic place where wishes can come true

How far can you see

[ANNIE]
I'm climbing up!

[JACK]
Annie, don't! We don't know who it belongs to!

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

Annie!

What?

Dinosaurs!

[JACK]
Hold on, I'm coming up!

[ANNIE (sung)
Books about faraway places
Pictures of wondrous sights to see

[MORGAN]
To go there, all that it takes is wishing

[ANNIE (spoken)]
See?

[MORGAN]
A wish to have an adventure

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[MORGAN]
A wish from the top of a tree

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

That day, Jack and Annie discovered that the Tree House is magic -- and later they found out that it belongs to me, Morgan le Fay, of Camelot. Since that first day in the woods, they have had many wondrous adventures...and we have become friends...

Morgan! Hi!

Welcome back! Did you have fun?

[JACK]
A knight at dawn

We only had to make a wish

[JACK]
And whoosh! We were gone!
To visit mummies in the morning

[ANNIE]
Sail with pirates past noon

[JACK and ANNIE]
We're going out for a minute, Mom
We'll be home soon!

[JACK]
After a night of ninjas
Back in old Japan

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[ANNIE]
Or an afternoon on the Amazon

[JACK]
With crocodiles and monkeys and a big python!

[ANNIE]
Yikes!

[JACK]
We might set out through the ice and snow

[ANNIE]
To see the sun set on a sabertooth
A million years ago

[JACK and ANNIE]
Or maybe even travel
Far above the world we know
Arrive at midnight on the moon
And watch the earth revolve below!

In the Tree House there's no limit
If we wish it when we're in it
And the magic starts to spin it
There's no limit, just no limit
There's no limit to the places we can go!

258,The Little Shoemaker,Downtown - The Best of Petula Clark,Petula Clark,1996-01-01,136906,20,"

In the shoemaker's shop
This refrain would never stop
As he tapped away
Working all the day

At his bench there was he
Just as busy as a bee
Little time to lose
With the boots and shoes

But his heart went pop
Inside the little shop
When a lovely girl
Set him all a whirl

She had come to choose
Some pretty dancing shoes
And he heard her say
In her charming way

""Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing all the day
Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing
Dancing all my cares away.""

Then he tapped and he stitched
For his fingers were bewitched
And he sewed a dream
Into every seam

Making shoes, oh so neat
Just like magic on her feet
And he hoped she'd know
That he loved her so

But she danced, danced, danced
As tho' she were entranced
Like a spinning top
All around the shop

On her dainty feet
She whirled into the street
And he heard her say
As she danced away

""Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing all the day
""Shoes to set my feet a-dancing, dancing
Dancing all my cares away.""

266,Cattle Call,The Essential Eddy Arnold,Eddy Arnold,1996-06-18,163346,37,"

The cattle are prowlin' the coyotes are howlin'
Out with the doggies bawl
Where spurs are jinglin' a cowboy is singin'
This lonesome cattle call

He rides in the sun till his day's work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Singin' this cattle call

For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call

He's brown as a bear from ridin' the prairie
And he sings with an old western drawl
Singin' this cattle call...

They say for every boy and girl
There's just one love in this whole world
And I know I've found mine

The heavenly touch of your embrace
Tells me no one could take your place
Ever in my heart

Young love, first love
Filled with true devotion
Young love, our love
We share with deep emotion

Just one kiss from your sweet lips
Will tell me that our love is real
And I can feel that it's true

For we will vow to one another
There will never be another
Love for you or for me

Young love, first love
Filled with true devotion
Young love, our love
We share with deep emotion

Young love, first love
Filled with true devotion
Young love, first love
Filled with true devotion

You wouldn't read my letter if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
But there's something I'm wanting to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life

To the places where the wine and liquor flows
Where you wait to be anybody's baby
And forget the truest love you'll ever know

And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay

Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more

Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I'll stop counting
That's the day my world would end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited, but you must have lost your way

Now I've got heartaches by the number
And the day that I'll stop counting
That's the day my world will end

277,El Paso,Gunfighter Ballads And Trail Songs,Marty Robbins,1959,259306,61,"

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl

[Verse 2]
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena
Wicked and evil while casting her spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

[Chorus 1]
One night, a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Feleena, the girl that I love

[Verse 3]
So in anger, I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

[Full Length Version Verse]
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Chorus 2]
Out through the back door of Rosa's, I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away, I did ride

[Post-Chorus]
Just as fast as I could from
The West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

[Verse 4]
Back in El Paso, my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Chorus 3]
I saddled up and away, I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow, a bullet may find me
Tonight, nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

[Verse 5]
And at last, here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Feleena, I go

[Verse 6]
Off to my right, I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

[Chorus 4]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

[Verse 7]
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

[Outro]
From out of nowhere, Feleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Feleena, goodbye

Out where the bright lights are glowing
You're drawn like a moth to a flame
You laugh while the wine's overflowing
While I sit and whisper your name

Four walls to hear me
Four walls to see
Four walls too near me
Closing in on me

Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting
But my walls have nothing to say
I'm made for love not for hating
So here where you left me I'll stay

One night with you is like heaven
And so while I'm walking the floor
I listen for steps in the hallway
And wait for your knock on my door

Four walls to hear me
Four walls to see
Four walls too near me
Closing in on me

Closing in on me

Send me the pillow that you dream on so darling I can dream on it too
Send me the pillow that you dream on maybe time will let our dreams come true
Send me the pillow that you dream on so darling I can dream on it too
I've waited so long for you to write me but just a mem'ry's all that's left of you
Send me the pillow that you dream on so darling I can dream on it too

So darling I can dream on it too

291,The Auctioneer,Golden Hits - The World's Most Famous Auctioneer,Leroy Van Dyke,1974-01-01,167622,49,"

[Intro]
Hey, alright, sir here we go there an' what can we get for 'em?
I have a 600 dollar down here now 10 now 25 an' a 35 an' now 55, 60, 65, 75, 75 another 85 dollars gonna buy 'em there

[Verse 1]
There was a boy in Arkansas who wouldn't listen to his ma
When she told him that he should go to school
He'd sneak away in the afternoon, take a little walk and pretty soon
You'd find him at the local auction barn
He'd stand and listen carefully then pretty soon he began to see
How the auctioneer could talk so rapidly
He said, ""Oh my it's do or die I've got to learn that auction cry
Gotta make my mark and be an auctioneer""

[Chorus]
25 dollar 30 now 30 dollar 30 dollar
30 dollar 30 dollar give me a hollar 30 dollar
Who will bid it at a 35 dollar bid?
35 dollar 35 35 make it 35 and a 35 make it 35 and a 35
Who will bid it at a 35 dollar bid?

[Verse 2]
As time went on he did his best and all could see he didn't jest
He practiced call and bids both night and day
His pappy'd find him behind the barn just a workin up an awful storm
As he tried to imitate the auctioneer
Then his pap said ""Son we just can't stand a havin' a mediocre man
You gotta take that auction usin' our good name
I'll send you off to auction school and then you'll be nobody's fool
You can take your place among the best""

[Chorus]
35 dollar 40 now 40 dollar 40 dollar
40 dollar 40 dollar give me a hollar 40 dollar
Who will bid it at at a 40 dollar bid?
40 dollar 45 45 will you make it 45 give me 45 and a 45
Who will bid it at a 45 dollar bid?

[Verse 3]
So from that morning he went to school there grew a man who played it cool
He came back home a full fledged auctioneer
And people came from miles around just to hear him make that rhythmic sound
That filled their hearts with such a happy cheer
His fame reached out from shore to shore he had all he could do and more
He had to buy a plane to get around
Now he's the tops in all the land so let's all give that man a hand
He's the best of all the auctioneers

[Chorus]
45 dollar 50 now 50 dollar 50 dollar
50 dollar 50 dollar give me a hollar 50 dollar
Who will bid it at a 50 dollar bill?
50 dollar 55 55 make it 55 and a 55 make it 55 and
Sold that hog for a 50 dollar bill

[Outro]
Hey, alright, sir open the gate, let em' out and walk 'em boys. Here a comes a lot number 29 in, what're we gon' get for 'em? I got a 25 I get a 35 an' now a 50 make it 50 better t' make it 55, 60, will ya give me 65, 75, an' now 85, an' now 95, 100, an' now a 25, an' get a 75 an' a 2 an' a 3 an' a 4 an' a 5 an' a 6 an' a 7 an' a 800 dollars gonna buy 'em there

[Verse 1]
Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 2]
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
And the straw boss said, ""Well-a bless my soul!""

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 3]
I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the cane brake by an old mama lion
Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 4]
If you see me comin' better step aside
A lot of men didn't, a lot of men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

[Chorus]
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 1]
That big eight wheeler a rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high for my little old sky
So I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the Southland, we're comin' to you
And we're movin' on, oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me, so I've set you free

Mister Fireman, won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
And keep movin' me on

Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on

I've told you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

[Verse 6]
You switched your engine, now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
'Cause I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
I've warned you twice, now you can settle the price
Cause I'm movin' on

[Verse 7]
But someday baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
Keep movin' on

297,Big River,Johnny Cash at Sun,Johnny Cash,2014-01-15,151426,50,"

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I followed you, Big River, when you called

Then you took me to St. Louis later on down the river
A freighter said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the bluff
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, Big River, more than me

[Break]

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, Big River
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

300,Don't Take Your Guns to Town,The Essential Johnny Cash,Johnny Cash,2002-02-12,182666,52,"

[Verse 1]
A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 2]
He laughed and kissed his mom
And said your Billy Joe's a man
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
I'd gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 3]
He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar
And laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 4]
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself atlast he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mothers words

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

[Verse 5]
Filled with rage then
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered around
And wondered at his final words

[Chorus]
Don't take your guns to town son
Leave your guns at home Bill
Don't take your guns to town

301,City Lights,Greatest Hits,Ray Price,1956,179600,35,"

A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabaretes and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget her name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights

The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
The God who put the stars above I don't believe made those lights
Oh it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights
Lights that say forget her love in a different athmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights

If you got a Cadillac boy
And a forty room shack boy
A bucket full of money
And a tree full of honey

But if you get no huggin'
No smoochin' or muggin'
Well, if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'

If you're ridin' on the gravy train
Instead of walkin' down lovers lane
You can't make hay boy
You're goin' the wrong way boy

You gotta get a little honey
It's better than money
Well, if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'

If they call you a big man
'Cause you got a lot of bottom land
If you're kin to the president
And if you help run the government

But if you get no attention
You better off on a pension
For if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'

If you got a string of long cars
And you're smoking them four-bit cigars
You ain't so well to do
Unless you get a little choochy coo

It takes a little of smackin'
Or your life is a lackin'
Well, if you ain't lovin'
Well, brother then you ain't livin'...

Away down yonder in the state of Arkansas
Where my great-grandpa met my great-grandma
They drink apple cider and they get on a jag
And they dance all night to the Salty Dog Rag
They play an old fiddle like you never heard before
They play the only tune that they ever did know
It's a ragtime ditty and the rhythm don’t drag
Now here's the way you dance to the Salty Dog Rag

One foot front, drag it back
Then you start to ball the jack
You shake and you break and then you sag
If your partner zigs you're supposed to zag
Your heart is light, you tap your feet
In rhythm with that ragtime beat
Just pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And dance all night to the Salty Dog Rag

Away down South ’neath the old Southern moon
The possum's up a tree and the hounds treed a coon
They'll hitch up the buggy to a broken down nag
And go out dancing to the Salty Dog Rag
They tune up the fiddle and they rosin up the bow
They strike a C chord on the old banjo
And holler hang on 'cause we ain't gonna drag
Now here's the way you dance to the Salty Dog Rag

One foot front, drag it back
Then you start to ball the jack
You shake and you break and then you sag
If your partner zigs you're supposed to zag
Your heart is light, you tap your feet
In rhythm with that ragtime beat
Just pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And dance all night to the Salty Dog Rag

Forever and always, my love will be true
I'd wait for a lifetime if you asked me to
You make me so happy, then leave me so blue
But I'd wait forever and always for you

Each night I pray that God above will let my dreams come true
To hear my prayer and make you care, my life I'd offer you
For riches won't buy you a heart true as gold
Forever and always, to have and to hold

Each night I pray that God above will let my dreams come true
To hear my prayer and make you care, my life I'd offer you
For riches won't buy you a heart true as gold

Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is winding low
I'm so lonesome, I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind the clouds
To hide its face and cry

Did you ever a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome, I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesomе, I could cry

Well, me and my baby are goin' steady
We ain't married but we're gettin' ready
To tie the knot and I'm gonna make her my own
Now that I've found her I'm gonna keep her
Finders keepers, losers weepers
She's my baby she's goin' steady with me

Well, I've been honky tonkin' round nearly all my life
But now I got a steady babe and I'm gonna make her my wife
All you rovin' ramblers can leave her alone
Don't even try to date her on the phone
'Cause she's my baby, she's goin' steady with me

Well, now sweet baby that we're goin' steady
I'll pull up and ask your daddy
What he thinks if you and I are wed
'Cause I love you and you love me
We're both as happy as can be
And I hope your daddy will let you go steady with me

Well, we'll get the rings and be on our way
To see the preacher man
And when you say I do sweetheart
I'll slip the ring on your loving hand
Everything's gonna turn out fine
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
'Cause you're my baby, you're goin' steady with me...

Got no plans for next Sunday

Do you wonder about me

Are you lonesome without me?
Have you found someone new?
Are you burning and yearning?
Do you ever get blue?

323,A Satisfied Mind,The Essential Porter Wagoner,Porter Wagoner,2013-06-04,166040,32,"

How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know that is so hard to find one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Once I was waiting in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it's happened I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When life has ended my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there's no doubt
But there's one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

Why must I love the heartless
One who'll never know the harm she's done
Though love is blind I should have known
Just call me lonesome from now on

I climb the stairs up to my room
But no one meets me in my gloom
The silence tells me she is gone
Just call me lonesome from now on

These walls will hide me when I cry
And hope that heaven lets me die
What good is life when hope is gone
Just call me lonesome from now on...

A boogie and a jumper called the Birmingham Bounce

And some like the beat of a big bare spiddle

When the music starts a-rockin', nobody's blue
A funny little rhythm with a solid sound
A boogie and a jumper called the Birmingham Bounce

If you like your music going eight to the bar
I know a way to make it best before
If the beat gets you movin' and you need a good start
Let's everybody dance to a steel guitar

When the music starts a-rockin', nobody's blue
A funny little rhythm with a solid sound
A boogie and a jumper called the Birmingham Bounce

Now whether it's hot or fine or sweet
If it's down in dixie, brother, it's got that beat
We don't have the moon or even the star
But here's that guitar going eight to the bar
Now everybody's dancin' and jumpin' too
When the music starts a-rockin', nobody's blue
A funny little rhythm with a solid sound
A boogie and a jumper called the Birmingham Bounce

[Verse 5]
When you come down south and you want a good time
Just come to a dance when you're feelin' fine
Now that's all it takes to spend a happy time
Let's all dance together and have a wonderful time!

When the music starts a-rockin', nobody's blue

Do ya'll have a pulse?

An inquisition has arisen
And I know it sounds ridiculous
But many have a vicious vision
Of what living is, plenty know what livid is
But if you're listening I want positive deposited
Synonymous with kids that are interested
In what is written in their Christmas lists

So do ya'll have a pulse?

A question again I'll pose
Some of ya'll say ""of course"" but ain't even close
But don't put your blade to your wrist to check it!
If life's a wreck then trust when I recommend and beckon second thoughts
Like ""it ain't over yet man""
Do your best to open your eyes, slope your grin wide
Open the blinds and let the sunshine and fun times inside
So when I ask the line about your personal welfare
I want to hear a clear and convincing ""Hell Yeah""

So do ya'll have a pulse?

Damn well thats great to know!
I've got a qualm I've been waiting to relate to though
You're familiar with how this situation goes
Maybe your day is slow and so you brave the coast
But you behave so gross like display and boast
That you've got a countenance the creates lakes from snow
We're all quiet with hatred so
Is it graceless or tasteless? Both!
It's best to suggest and just shake the pose
Forget the break bliss prose
Smiles, you never want to wait to show
Its a wildflower that you want to rake and grow
So start befriending me and wake the pulse
Because it's our energy that'll make the show!

Grins and laughter ought to with Oscars and Grammy's soon
So answer my conclusion questions with a ""yeah we do""

Do to hate when you scarcely move?
Do you hate when you're very lewd?
Do you hate when you're scary crude?
Do you love what you hear me do?
Now I can smile really clearly too
We've all got a pulse it ain't something that we should barely prove

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

Go, go
Go Johnny go
Go go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go

Try to get a date

You gotta work late""

""Son, you gotta make some money
If you wanna use the car
To go a-ridin' next Sunday""

Cause you didn't work a lick""

You're a real mean guy

And it's a crying shame
And I know that you're the one to blame

'Bout a half past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool
You've even got me carrying his books to school

Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me

You mixed me up
But good
Right from the very start
Hey, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart

You've got me jumping
Like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're putting down
Since I kissed his loving lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine

Get all that garbage out of sight

You tell me that you're leaving
I can't believe it's true
Girl, there's just no living
Without you

Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
Cause if you go then I'll be blue
Breaking up is hard to do

Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do

[Chorus]
They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know, I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up, I wish that we were making up again

I beg of you, don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love just one more try
Come on baby, let's start anew
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is oh so hard to do

Or just a moment's pleasure?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?

Is love I can be sure of

Will you still love me tomorrow?

So tell me now, and I won't ask again

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go
Go go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Oh go go, Johnny go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

Let me tell you about a girl I know
She is my baby and she live next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She bring my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know

388,Big Iron,Gunfighter Ballads And Trail Songs,Marty Robbins,1959,235733,67,"

[Verse 1]
To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 2]
It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
""He's an outlaw loose and running""
Came the whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip""
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 3]
In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

[Verse 4]
Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona Ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

[Verse 5]
Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 6]
The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome Ranger
Was about to meet his death
'Bout to meet his death

[Verse 7]
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the Ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 8]
It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin'
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Outro]
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

You study 'em hard and hopin' to pass
Workin' your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books, get out of your seat
Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in

Sekunden på sin vän

På en flicka som är kär
Han är ung, han är kung

Håll min hatt!
Var är skorna?
Hämta broschen i mitt skrin!
Snart så ska jag möta Augustin!

Kära mor, sitt ej uppe
Och vänta är du snäll
Snart så ska jag fylla 22
Det ska inte bli sent
Som det blev i förrgår kväll
Åh, nu måste jag skynda mig på
Springer jag fort
Ska jag hinna så precis
Aj, där gick en maska
Och just nu naturligtvis

Augustin väntar aldrig
På en flicka som är kär
Han är ung, han är kung
Han är grann och populär
Ska han nu kanske hinna
Bort och vissla hos Kristin?
Eller väntar du mig, Augustin?

Med förvåning och oro
Han står i månens sken
Vad är nu det här för nonchalans?
Aldrig har han tänkt krusa
En jänta som är sen
Nej, då fick väl nån annan en chans
Men så är livet
Att det man inte får
Just är det som man vill ha
Om ni mig rätt förstår

Augustin, han fick vänta
Tills han själv blev lika kär
Fastän ung, fastän kung
Fastän grann och populär
Ja, så går det för den som blir
För plötsligt maskulin
Och det glömmer aldrig Augustin
Och det glömmer aldrig Augustin

They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Cannot be denied

They said some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
(Without my love)

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide, hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies

Smoke gets in your eyes
(Smoke gets in your eyes)

Smoke gets in your eyes!

And I seem to hear the night wind cry

""Go hang your dreams on the hangin' tree
Your dreams of love that could never be
Hang your faded dreams on the hangin' tree!""

(The hangin' tree)

[Verse 2]
I searched for gold and I found my gold
And I found a girl who loved just me
And I wished that I could love her too

But I'd left my heart on the hangin' tree
I'd left my heart with a memory (a memory)
And a faded dream on the hangin' tree

(The hangin' tree)

[Verse 3]
Now there were men who craved my gold
And meant to take (ooh) my gold from me
When a man is gone he needs no gold

So they carried me to the hangin' tree
To join my dreams and a memory (a memory)
Yes, they carried me to the hangin' tree

(The hangin' tree)

[Verse 4]
To really live you must almost die (wop doo-wah)
And it happened just that way with me (wop doo-wah)
They took the gold and set me free

(Ah) And I walked away from the hangin' tree
I walked away from the hangin' tree
(the hangin' tree)
And my own true love, she walked with me!

[Bridge]
That's when I knew that the hangin' tree
Was a tree of life, new life for me
A tree of hope, new hope for me
A tree of love, new love for me
The hangin' tree (the hangin' tree)
The hangin' tree (the hangin' tree)
The hangin' tree! (the hangin' tree)

운명이 날 데려와
심장이 널 기억해
One's true love one's true love so I stay

꽃은 지고 향기도 없이
시들어갔어
초라한 나를 무심한 나를
니가 지켜 온거야

Pull me away pull me away 말하고 싶은데
Hold me again hold me again 소리쳐 말 못하네

사라질까봐
마법일까 꿈속인걸까
잊었었는데 손 닿을 만큼 가까운 곳에

지금 니가 서있어
운명이 날 데려와
심장이 널 기억해
One's true love one's true love so I stay

Pull me away pull me away 말하고 싶은데
Hold me again hold me again 소리쳐 말 못하네
Pull me away pull me away 말하고 싶은데
Hold me again hold me again 소리쳐 말 못하네
Pull me away pull me away 말하고 싶은데
Hold me again hold me again 소리쳐 말 못하네
사라질까봐

[Chorus]
(I can't stop loving you)
I've made up my mind
To live in memories of the lonesome times
(I can't stop wanting you)
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterdays
(Dreams of yesterday)

Those happy hours that we once knew
Though long ago, they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we've been apart

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love

And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all

Someone to care
Someone to share
Lonely hours and moments of despair
To be loved, to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved

Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away
To hear from each day
To be loved, to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved

Some wish to be a king or a queen
Some wish for fortune and fame
But to be, truly, truly, truly loved is
More than all of these things

Someone to kiss
Someone to miss
When you're away to hear from each day
To be loved, to be loved, to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved
To be loved, to be loved, oh what a feeling
To be loved

Your smile is bliss
I'd be a fool to fear the storm that's in your kiss
Let your kiss destroy or save me, so shall it be
Till life is through, no one but you for me

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart

Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart

But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

Magic moments
When two hearts are caring
Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing

I'll never forget the moment
We kissed the night of the hayride
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm
While taking a sleigh ride

[Chorus]
Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing
Magic moments
When two hearts are caring
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

[Verse 2]
The telephone call
That tied up the line for hours and hours
The Saturday dance I got up the nerve
To send you some flowers

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The way that we cheered
Whenever our team was scoring a touch down
The time that the floor fell out of my car
When I put the clutch down

[Verse 4]
The penny arcade, the games that we played
The fun and the prizes
The Halloween hop when everyone came
In funny disguises
Magic moments
Filled with love

Adam and Eve again, hold my hand

This is the secret of what bliss is
For bliss is what your kiss is
At last I understand

So this is the kingdom of Heaven
And here on the threshold we stand
Pass through the portal now
We'll be immortal now, hold my hand

And here on the threshold we stand
Pass through the portal now

And the answer you give
May they still be the same
For as long as we live
That you'll always be there

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm going to treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her he said
Julie Baby, you're my flame
Thou giveth fever
When we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yeah I burn, forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him
She said, Daddy, oh don't you dare
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his missus
Daddy won't you treat him right?

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

Fever, if you live you learn
Fever till you sizzle

[Verse 1]
I can't stop loving you
I said  I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time

[Verse 2]
And I can't stop wanting you
I said It's useless to say, yes I did
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

[Verse 3]
Those happy hours
All that we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue

[Verse 4]
They say that time
It heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart

[Verse 1]
I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time

[Verse 2]
And I can't stop wanting you
I said it's useless to say, yes I did
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

My darlin' I have often thought of things we used to do
And now I sit and wonder why you're gone and left me blue

Oh my darlin', why do I love you so?
Oh my darlin', why do I love you so?

Is it because you stroked my hair when you were by my side?
Or is it because of the tears you cried when your little puppy died?

What a difference a day made
Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain

My yesterday was blue dear
Today I'm a part of you dear
My lonely nights are through dear
Since you said you were mine

Lord, what a difference a day made
Theres a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss;
That thrilling kiss

It's heaven when you
Find romance on your menu
What a difference a day made
And the difference is you

The sun above would be never shine again
There would be teardrops in the sky

Well, just to prove you do
Go on and cry me a river
I'd like to see you cry me a river

Just walking in the rain
Getting soaking wet
Torturing my heart
By trying to forget

Just walking in the rain
So alone and blue
All because my heart
Still remembers you

Shaking their heads in sorrow
Saying, ""Who can that fool be?""

Just walking in the rain
Thinking how we met
Knowing things could change
Somehow I can't forget

I tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger, unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love, yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

462,But Not For Me,True 50's love,Various Artists,2008-01-01,211546,0,"

I've got some old flames whose heat sears
But if not for old flames I wouldn't be here
There's nothing I'd take to repeat my sins for
But if not for some sins, I might not have been born

Strange how the things that plague me
Are the same that made me
Strange how the things I regret
Are the seeds I needed

No chemical vices I choose I submit to
Might not have been advice
If not for what they'd been through
There have been people who I've let abuse me
But if not for bruises I wouldn't seek beauty

Odd how the things that seize us
Are the same that free us
Odd how the things that siege us
Are the same that teach us

There may be awkwardness
In our origins
But even awful limbs
With morbid tints
Bear cores within
One autumn wind or
Storm will rip it
From the leaves thrown
Clouds pour the swim
For seeds sown
In scores of ticks
There will be a tree grown
For a Rembrandt
To make a portrait with
An easel
Portraying gorgeousness
With ease, most remember it:
Rain waters it and reaps growth
Earth fosters it in a deep cloak
So next time you hate these zones
Please know that you need both...

Strange how the things that plague me
Are the same that made me
Strange how the things I regret
Are the seeds I needed
Odd how the things that seize us
Are the same that free us
Odd how the things that siege us
Are the same that teach us

Then turn around, heading for the lights of town
Hurtin' me through and through
Call me Mr. Blue

I stay at home at night
Right by the phone at night
But you won't call
And I won't hurt my pride
Call me Mr

I won't tell you
While you paint the town
A bright red to turn it upside down
I'm painting it too

But I'm painting it blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue
Call me Mr. Blue

470,Crying My Heart Out for You,Rock with Sedaka (Expanded Edition),Neil Sedaka,1959-06-12,133626,31,"

Standing all alone with teardrops in my eyes
Looking through my window as the lovers passing by
And I stand alone, all alone, crying my heart out for you

Looking through my window i see the moon above
It's a lovely night for romance a perfect night for love
But I stand alone, all alone, crying my heart out for you

I remember you, the love we used to know
Walking hand in hand in the street below

I see a boy and girl smiling as they meet
They walk hand in hand to the park across the street
While I stand alone, all alone, crying my heart out for you

One kiss, one little sigh
That's all you gave me
When you said goodbye
But someday, baby
Someday, darlin'
You're gonna miss me

Long gone is your caress
And with it all my happiness
But someday baby, someday darlin'
You're gonna miss me
Oh, oh, oh, yes

One of these nights
You'll wake up cryin'
But I won't be there to comfort you
You'll turn on the light
But you'll go on cryin'
'Cause only my true love
Can chase away your blues

Oh yes, you're gonna learn
I'm not the only one
Whose heart will burn
'Cause someday, baby
Someday darlin'
You're gonna miss me
Miss me, miss me, miss me

Someday baby, someday darling
You're gonna miss me

472,Prisoner Of Love,Remember When?,The Platters,1959-01-01,184373,44,"

Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty
Why should I be a lone soul?
Why can't I be my own soul?
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner of love
For one command I stand and wait now
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another for I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love, love

She wore Blue Velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of

Blue Velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see Blue Velvet through my tears

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of Blue Velvet

But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see Blue Velvet through our tears

Without a warning
The blues walked in this morning
And circled round my lonely room
I didn't know why I had
That sad and lonely feeling
'till my baby called and said it's through
Yesterday I sang a love song
But today I sing the blues

I know the explanation
But that's no constellation
No matter how your love
You can lose
And since I lost
I rather walk around and worry
I guess I've walked the darkest avenue

Yesterday I sang a love song
But today I sing the blues
Now it strikes me kind of funny
How life can be this way
We were lovers last night honey
But not in love today
Now it strikes me kind of funny
How faith can be unfair
It seems that I'm the one
To lose in every love affair
Yes it must be written for me
That I should be the one to always lose
Yesterday I sang a love song
But today I sing the blues

Now it strikes me kind of funny
How life can be this way
We were lovers last night honey
But not in love today
Now it strikes me kind of funny
How faith can be unfair
It seems that I'm the one
To lose in every love affair
Yes it must be written for me
That I should be the one to always lose

Alone in the world
Was poor little Anne
As sweet a young child as you'd find

Her parents had gone
To their final reward
Leaving their baby behind

Did ya hear?

This ... poor little child
Was only nine years of age
When mother and dad went away

Still she bravely worked
At the one thing she knew
To earn her few pennies a day

She made artificial flowers
Artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear

She made artificial flowers
Ya know ... those artificial flowers
Fashioned from Annie's despair

With paper and shears
With some wire and wax
She made up each tulip and mum

As snowflakes drifted
Into her tenement room
Her baby little fingers grew numb

From making artificial flowers
Those artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of high fashion to wear

She made artificial flowers
Artificial flowers
Made from Annie's despair

They found little Annie
All covered with ice
Still clutching her poor frozen shears

Amidst all the blossoms
She had fashioned by hand
And watered with all her young tears

There must be a heaven
Where little Annie can play
In heavenly gardens and bowers

And instead of a halo
She'll wear 'round her head
A garland of genuine flowers

No more artificial flowers
Throw away those artificial flowers
Flowers for ladies of society to wear

Throw away those artificial flowers
Those dumb-dumb flowers ...
Fashioned from Annie's ...

Fashioned from Annie's despair

Give her the real thing!

I wanna be around to pick up the pieces when somebody breaks your heart
Somebody twice as smart as I
Somebody who will swear to be true like you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn that misery loves company, wait and see
I wanna be around to see how he does it when he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits, so fine
And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
That's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applauding from a front row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
Like you, like you broke mine

Round a lady bee buzzin'
Just count to ten then count again
There's sure to be an even dozen

Now, there was two butterflies castin' their eyes
Both in the same direction
You'd never guess that one little yes
Could start a butterfly collection

Multiplication
That's the name of the game
And each generation
They play the same

Let me tell ya now …I say one and one is five
You can call me a silly goat
But, ya take two minks add two winks
Ahhh ... ya got one mink coat

When a girl gets coy in front of a boy
After three or four dances
Ah … you can just bet she'll play hard to get
To multiply her chances

Multiplication

You know they play the same

Hear me talkin' to ya …Mother Nature's a clever girl
She relies on habit
Ya take two hares with no cares
Pretty soon you got a room full of rabbits

Parakeets in-between tweets
Sometimes get too quiet
Uh-oh … but, have no fear 'cause soon you'll hear
A parakeet's riot just try it

In a cavern down by a canyon
Excavatin' for a mine
There lived a miner from North Carolina
And his daughter, chubby Clementine

Now every mornin', just about dawnin'
A'when the sun begins to shine
You know she would rouse up, wake all a dem cows up
And walk 'em down to her Daddy's mine

A'took the foot bridge, way 'cross the water
Though she weighed two-ninety nine
The old bridge trembled and disassembled
(Oops!) dumped her into the foamy brine

Hey, crackle like thunder, (ho, ho) she went under
(ho, ho) blowin bubbles (bubble sound) down the line
Hey, I'm no swimm'a but were she slimm'a
I might'a saved that Clementine

(Ho) broke the record, way under water
I thought that she was doin' fine
I wasn't nervous ya until the service
That they held for Clementine

Hey you sailor (ho, ho) way out in your whaler
With a harpoon, your trusty line
If she shows now, yell, ""there she blows now""
It just may be chunky Clementine

(One more time)
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin'
Oh my darlin' , oh my darlin' sweet Clementine
You may be gone

But!
You're not forgotten
Fare thee well
So long, Clementine

524,I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am,The Essential Dean Martin,Dean Martin,2014-10-10,194066,26,"

Things I learned in a hobo jungle
Were things they never taught me in a class room
Like where to find a handout
While thumbing through Chicago in the afternoon

Hey I'm not bragging or complaining
I'm just talking to myself man to man
This old lentil fat I'm chewing
Didn't take a lot of doing
But I take a lot of pride in what I am

I guess I grew up a loner
Don't remember ever having any folks around
But I keep thumbing through the phonebooks
And looking for my Daddy's name in every town

And I meet lots of people
But I always end up leaving on the lam
Hey where I've been, where I'm going
I didn't take a lot of knowing
But I take a lot of pride in what I am

I never travel in a hurry
'Cause I got nobody waiting for me anywhere
Home is anywhere I'm living
If it's sleeping on some vacant beach or city square
Or if I'm working on some road gang
Or just living off the fat of our great land
I never been nobody's idol but at least I have a title
And I take a lot of pride in what I am

This old lentil fat I'm chewing
Didn't take a lot of doing
I take a lot of pride in what I am

And you with your lips getting bolder
A sky full of moon and a sweet mellow tune

Imagine you in a gown white and flowery
And me thanking Dad for your dowry
A church full of folks and those last minute jokes
I'll buy that dream

A honeymoon in Cairo with a brand new autogyro
Then home by rocket in a wink
We'll settle down at Dallas in a little old crazy palace
It's not as crazy as you think

Imagine me on our first anniversary
With someone like you in the nursery
It doesn't sound bad and if it can be had

E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito

Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù
E volavo, volavo felice piu in alto del sole ed ancora piu sù
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiù
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me

Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassù

Here we sit enjoying the shade
Drink the drink that I have made
Tell you why the day is sunny
I'm in love with lips of honey
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother pour the wine

She is coming here to stay
I have waited for the day
She writes of love in every letter
Others have tried but I will get her
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother pour the wine

What is life
What is loving
What are all the stars that shine
Love my friend is everything
And love will soon be mine

Pour it quickly as you can
Pour it quickly once again
She's here at last my one and only
Goodbye friends and don't be lonely
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother pour the wine

Blink your eyes and love has passed
Hers was never made to last
She introduced me to another
No my friends, he's not her brother
I will miss the way she walks
Hey brother pour the wine
Hey brother pour the wine

[Verse 1]
I'm coming home
I've done my time
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
If you received my letter telling you
I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me
If you still want me

[Chorus]
Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
It's been three long years
Do ya still want me

If I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree

[Verse 2]
Bus driver
Please look for me
Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
I'm really still in prison

And my love
She holds the key
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free
I wrote and told her please

[Chorus]
Tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
It's been three long years
Do ya still want me

If I don't see a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
I'll stay on the bus
Forget about us
Put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree

[Bridge]
Now the whole damned bus is cheering
And I can't believe I see
A hundred yellow ribbons 'round the ole oak tree

(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)
(Tie a ribbon 'round the ole oak tree)

Well it's lonesome in this old town
Everybody puts me down
I'm a face without a name
Just walking in the rain
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
I got holes in both of my shoes
Well I'm a walking case of the blues
Saw a dollar yesterday
But the wind blew it away
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
I haven't eaten in about a week
I'm so hungry when I walk I squeak
Nobody calls me friend
It's sad the shape I'm in
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston
I got a girl waiting there for me
Well at least she said she'd be
I got a home and a big warm bed
And a feather pillow for my head
Goin' back to Houston, Houston, Houston

Long long ago
Long long ago
Long long ago
Well they say it was better in oh so many ways
Long long ago, long ago

They couldn't go to a movie show, listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
And on a very cold and wintery night
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight
And when the summer came
They will have to take a dame all bundled up to the beach
They didn't know a girl could look so cute
In a bikini suit

Oh how they sing of the good, good old days
Long long ago
Long long ago
They couldn't swing in the good old days
Long long ago, long ago

They couldn't go to a movie show, listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
But they still talk of the good, good old days
And on a very cold and wintery night
Long long ago
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight
Long long ago
So when people say to me ""nothings like it used to be""
I don't believe that it's so
They say it was better in so many ways
They didn't have so much to brag about
Long long ago, long ago
Long long ago
Long long ago
Long long ago

Honey, you wanna know about bad?

PEGGY:
When I was a young girl
'Bout the age of one
I shot up my crib
With a BB gun
I never behaved
Never followed no rules
They kicked me out of nine nursery schools!

Every year for Mother's Day I'd steal my mother's purse
(She steals her mother's purse)
So if you wanna be bad
You're gonna have to do a whole lot worse

My whole life long

I can hold up a bank
Using only my face
I'm the nastiеst creature

On Halloween I dress up as me!

One look my way could make an angry mob disperse

So if you wanna be bad
You're gonna have to do a whole lot worse
(A whole lot worse)

You never litter
Or loiter
Or drink from a can!

WANDA:
My body's a paradise
Of swivels and curves
Ever since I was twelve
I've been a magnet for perves
One day the Oscar Mayer man
Tried to cop a feel
I climbed up and stabbed him in his weinermobile!

I nearly turned that hotdog into a hearse

I wanna live long (yeah I doubt it)
I don’t want sorrow, I wanna thrive
I want mine now, on the rhyme
I wanna live long (but I doubt it)
I wanna live long

[Verse 2]
In the hood, it’s like a melting pot
Not caring if hell is hot
You can get wet up under umbrellas from a felon shot
I don’t see the man with every dream taking lessons from a fiend
And the business ran by greed
Where employees probably bleed when they cracking out
Listen and see if you point the problem out
Being there is walking, smiling, buying whole islands now
Brothers I grew up with, hearts stopping, they dying now
I ain’t gonna sit and deny, I’m watching my diet now
I’m pissed they let police pull a pistol, pop us, then buy em out
But sip expensive name brand liquors and spending large amounts
I ain’t had no trust funds
Our parents don’t even trust us
From stealing out they purses and wallets before the bus come
Whites call us thugs
We live and thuggin’ for fun now
Learn to be so high
We feel depressed when we come down
Where we made it from where we used to be is like from the wake to the eulogy
This feeling I deal with is nothing new to me

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna suffer, I wanna prosper
I want mine now, I want options
I wanna live long (but I doubt it)
I wanna live long (yeah I doubt it)
I don’t want sorrow, I wanna thrive
I want mine now, on the rhyme
I wanna live long (but I doubt it)
I wanna live long (yeah I doubt it)

Take out the papers and the trash
Or you don't get no spendin' cash
If you don't scrub that kitchen floor
You ain't gonna rock and roll no more
Yakety yak (don't talk back)

Just finish cleanin' up your room
Let's see that dust fly with that broom
Get all that garbage out of sight
Or you don't go out Friday night
Yakety yak (don't talk back)

You just put on your coat and hat
And walk yourself to the laundromat
And when you finish doin' that
Bring in the dog and put out the cat
Yakety yak (don't talk back)

Don't you give me no dirty looks
Your father's hip; he knows what cooks
Just tell your hoodlum friend outside
You ain't got time to take a ride

{Intro}

[Verse 1]
As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

[Chorus]
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

[Verse 2]
The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

[Verse 3]
I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

[Chorus]
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me

[Verse 4]
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

[Chorus]
Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care

[Outro]
I'll be looking everyday
I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere

You've given me a true love and ev'ry day I thank you love
For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting

A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly, oo, your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine 'til I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world made for you and me
Oo love me
Whenever you are near I Hear A Symphony play sweet and tenderly
Ev'ry time your lips meet mine my baby
Baby, baby, I feel a joy within
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now baby

I care not for myself but for those
Who've never felt the joy we've felt

Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air now

[Verse 1]
Well, no one told me about her
The way she lied
Well, no one told me about her
How many people cried

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know? Why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there!

[Chorus]
Well, let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
The way she acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there

[Verse 2]
Well, no one told me about her
What could I do?
Well, no one told me about her
Though they all knew

591,Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,The Best Of The Animals,The Animals,1966-02,148346,42,"

Instrumental Intro

Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
Because I love you, oh
Oh, oh baby don't you know I'm human
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself long regretting
Some foolish thing some little simple thing I've done

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Hey, hey, hey
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you

[Verse 1]
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
'Cause you won't let me
You upset me, boy
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (That I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise, yet I adore you

[Chorus]
(And I) hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so

[Verse 2]
You completely know the power that you have (Power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (Makes me laugh)
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (Why)
And it just ain't right, oh

I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I, no, no, no
I hate that I love you

One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me

Yeah yeah

That's how much I love you
How much as I need you

[Verse 1]
There must be some word today
From my boyfriend who's so far away
Please Mr. Postman, look and see
Is there a letter, a letter for me
I've been standing here waiting, Mr. Postman
So-o, so patiently
For just a card or just a letter saying he's returning home to me

[Chorus]
(Please Mr. Postman)
Please Mr. Postman, look and see (Oh yeah)
Is there a letter in your bag for me?
(Please, please Mr. Po-o-ostman)
'Cause it's been a mighty long time (Whoa, yeah)
Since I heard from this boyfriend of mine

[Verse 2]
So many days, you've passed me by (Wait Mr. Postman)
You saw the tears standing in my eye (Wait Mr. Postman)
You wouldn't stop to make me feel better (Wait Mr. Postman)
By leaving me a card or a letter
Please Mr. Postman, look and see (Postman, postman)
Is there a letter, oh yeah, in your bag for me (Postman, postman)
You know it's been so long (Postman, postman)
Yeah, since I heard from this boyfriend of mine (Postman, postman)

[Outro]
You better wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Oh, you better wait a minute
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Please, please Mr. Postman.  (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Please check and see just one more time for me
You better wait, wait a minute  (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Please Mr. Postman  (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better
Wait a minute, wait a minute  (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Wait a minute please, Mr. Postman, wait
(Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Wait, wait a minute, Mr. Postman)

What are you gonna do when I'm gone
Whose shoulder are you gonna cry on
What are you gonna do on the day
When I turn my head and just walk away
What are you gonna say to your friends
When the talk around town begins
Will you tell them how you treated me bad
Will you tell them how you made me so sad
'Cause you make some people
Think that you love me a lot
But they just don't know you
And what they see isn't what we've got
We're happy in the public eye
They think you're such a wonderful guy
But they don't know how much you've lied
And they don't know how much I've cried
You're a real Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde
Oh, yeah
You make a pass at
Every girl that you see
Then when they hurt you
You come running and crying to me
I comfort you whenever you're low
And you don't have a place you can go
You put your head on my shoulder to cry
And then you turn around and tell me a lie
And I just can't take it
I've gotta make it now
What are you gonna do when I'm gone
And what are you gonna do when I'm gone
What are you gonna do when I'm gone
What are you gonna do when I'm gone

He steps on the floor without making a sound
Then he starts feeling the beat
You would think the floor was greased
By the way he's moving his feet

He's a champion
He's the best
Impossible to tame

Listen to the sound of his name

They call him

The whole room starts to reel

You know he's

He glides like a wild eagle

Lightning flashes when he leaps up
He's got everybody shouting for more
Thunder crashes when he hits the ground
He's burnin' up the dancin' floor

604,Then He Kissed Me,The Phil Spector Collection,Various Artists,2010-07-27,157733,12,"

I was strolling home one morning
And the sun was mighty friendly
Her solar lips tenderly kissed my left cheek
As the breath of breeze gently caressed me
Suddenly a younger teen of twelve or so
Face swelled with hope rode intimately adjacently
On his bike, he fought timidity blatantly as our eyes caught
Then I defined the cause as to why his ride was paused
He quickly inquired, ""have you seen a twenty on the sidewalk?""
At first I'd thought ""I've seen no bill"" but then I figured
""what the hell, he'd never write me in his will
But write me off as swell, well, I'm sure he will!""
I said ""Chill, friend, buddy, chum, you're still in plenty luck
I handed him the Jackson headed twenty bucks
I complimentarily fished out of my shorts
He cocked his head to me and sure revealed the gleam of his now confident teeth so pure!
He seemed relieved to say the least that Id returned
The green then expressively he returned the glee the
He'd returned the way he came to me
I continued onward my homebound path
Feeling grand that I'd handed the lad the cash
I had nearly arrived when excitedly I had spied, surprised
The twenty that he had tried to find, I let it slide into my wallet
And I thought regardless of if Id found it, I'd have found
That it always pays to be kind

[Kate]
Sure

[Princeton]
Well, you know Trekkie Monster upstairs?

[Kate]
Uh huh

[Princeton]
Well, he's Trekkie Monster, and you're Kate Monster

[Kate]
Right

[Princeton]
You're both Monsters

[Kate]
Yeah

[Princeton]
Are you two related?

[Kate]
What? Princeton! I'm surprised at you! I find that racist

[Princeton]
Oh, well, I'm sorry, I was just asking

[Kate]
Well, it's a touchy subject
No, not all monsters are related
What are you trying say, huh?
That we all look the same to you?
Huh, huh, huh?

[Princeton]
No, no, no, oh, not at all
I'm sorry, I guess that was a little racist

[Kate]
I should say so
You should be much more careful
When you're talking about the sensitive subject of race

[Princeton]
Well, look who's talking!

[Kate]
What do you mean?

[Princeton]
What about that special Monster school you told me about?

[Kate]
What about it?

[Princeton]
Well could someone like me go there?

[Kate]
No, we don't want people like you

[Princeton]
Ha ha ha ha ha, you see?
You're a little bit racist

[Kate]
Well, you're a little bit too

[Princeton]
I guess we're both a little bit racist

[Kate]
Admitting it is not an easy thing to do

[Princeton]
But I guess it's true

[Kate]
Between me and you

[Both]
I think everyone's a little bit racist sometimes
Doesn't mean we go around committing hate crimes
Look around and you will find
No one's really color blind
Maybe it's a fact we all should face
Everyone makes judgments based on race

[Princeton]
No, not big judgments, like who to hire
Or who to buy a newspaper from

[Kate]
No

[Princeton]
No, just little judgments like thinking that Mexican
Busboys should learn to speak goddamn English!

[Kate]
Right!

[Both]
Everyone's a little bit racist today
So, everyone's a little bit racist, okay
Ethnic jokes might be uncouth
But you laugh because they're based on truth
Don't take them as personal attacks
Everyone enjoys them, so relax

[Princeton]
All right, stop me if you've heard this one

[Kate]
Okay!

[Princeton]
Alright there's a plane going down
And there's only one parachute
And there's a rabbi, a priest

[Kate]
And a black guy!

Whatchoo talkin' 'bout Kate?

[Kate]
Uh....

[Gary]
You were telling a black joke

[Princeton]
Well, sure, Gary, but lots of people tell black jokes

[Gary]
I don't!

[Princeton]
Well, of course you don't—you're black
But I bet you tell Polack jokes, right?

[Gary]
Well, sure I do, those stupid Polacks, ha ha ha

[Princeton]
Now, don't you think that's a little racist?

[Gary]
Well damn, I guess you're right

[Kate]
You're a little bit racist

[Gary]
Well, you're a little bit too

[Princeton]
We're all a little bit racist!

I think that I would have to agree with you

We're glad you do

[Gary]
It's sad but true
Everyone's a little bit racist, all right

[Kate]
All right

[Princeton]
All right

[Gary]
All right
Bigotry has never been
Exclusively white

[All]
If we all could just admit
That we are racist a little bit
Even though we all know that it's wrong
Maybe it would help us get along

[Princeton]
Oh, Christ, do I feel good?

[Gary]
Now there was a fine upstanding black man

[Princeton]
Who?

[Gary]
Jesus Christ

[Kate]
But, Gary, Jesus was white

No, Jesus was black

Nope
How many Oriental wives
Have you got?

What? Brian!

Brian, buddy, where you been?

[Christmas Eve]
I know you are no intending to be
But calling me Oriental—offensive to me!

[Brian]
I'm sorry, honey, I love you

[Christmas Eve]
And I love you

[Brian]
But you're racist, too

[Christmas Eve]
Yeah, I know

The Jews have all the money
And the whites have all the power
And I'm always in taxi cab
With driver who no shower

[Kate]
Me too

[Princeton and possibly Brian]
Me too

[Gary]
I can't even get a taxi!

And everyone stopped being so PC
Maybe we could live in harmony

Denzel said it first
Never seen a moving truck followed by a hearse
Never seen heaven, only hell on this Earth
My pain is so deep, on swell finna burst
I hit the block, ready to rock on anger
Override danger
Deal with devils, saw angels
I’m on edge, whole hood is incarcerated
Cataloged by the loss so I’m staying faded
Unbearable, being in the physical
I need a miracle, ain’t even spiritual
Looting and violence, they say that I’m violent
I’m on survival mode, I’m so defiant
My health dwindling, got chronic stress
High blood pressure, accelerated death
Accelerated aging, accelerated debt
All of my people fading, ain’t nobody left

I want mine now, I want options

I wanna live long (but I doubt it)
I wanna live long

[Verse 2]
In the hood, it’s like a melting pot
Not caring if hell is hot
You can get wet up under umbrellas from a felon shot
I don’t see the man with every dream taking lessons from a fiend
And the business ran by greed
Where employees probably bleed when they cracking out
Listen and see if you point the problem out
Being there is walking, smiling, buying whole islands now
Brothers I grew up with, hearts stopping, they dying now
I ain’t gonna sit and deny, I’m watching my diet now
I’m pissed they let police pull a pistol, pop us, then buy em out
But sip expensive name brand liquors and spending large amounts
I ain’t had no trust funds
Our parents don’t even trust us
From stealing out they purses and wallets before the bus come
Whites call us thugs
We live and thuggin’ for fun now
Learn to be so high
We feel depressed when we come down
Where we made it from where we used to be is like from the wake to the eulogy
This feeling I deal with is nothing new to me

I don’t wanna suffer, I wanna prosper
I want mine now, I want options
I wanna live long (but I doubt it)

That day, Jack and Annie discovered that the Tree House is magic -- and later they found out that it belongs to me, Morgan le Fay, of Camelot. Since that first day in the woods, they have had many wondrous adventures...and we have become friends...

[ANNIE]
Morgan! Hi!

[MORGAN]
Welcome back! Did you have fun?

[JACK]
Yep. We did

[ANNIE]
And look what we brought you!

[JACK]
It's a mango! From a rainforest!

[ANNIE]
And a moonstone! From a real ninja!

[JACK]
And look! A mammoth bone from the Ice Age!

[ANNIE]
This is the best summer we've ever had!

[JACK and ANNIE (sung)]
We saw dinosaurs before dark

[JACK]
A knight at dawn

[ANNIE]
We only had to make a wish

[JACK]
And whoosh! We were gone!
To visit mummies in the morning

[ANNIE]
Sail with pirates past noon

[JACK and ANNIE]
We're going out for a minute, Mom
We'll be home soon!

[JACK]
After a night of ninjas
Back in old Japan

[ANNIE]
Oh, wow!

[JACK]
Oh, man!

[ANNIE]
Or an afternoon on the Amazon

[JACK]
With crocodiles and monkeys and a big python!

[ANNIE]
Yikes!

[JACK]
We might set out through the ice and snow

[ANNIE]
To see the sun set on a sabertooth
A million years ago

[JACK and ANNIE]
Or maybe even travel
Far above the world we know
Arrive at midnight on the moon
And watch the earth revolve below!

In the Tree House there's no limit
If we wish it when we're in it
And the magic starts to spin it
There's no limit, just no limit
There's no limit to the places we can go!

[MORGAN (sung)]
How far can you see

[ANNIE]
My brother and me

[JACK]
My sister and me

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[ANNIE]
From the top of a tree?

[JACK]
From the top of a tree?

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[ANNIE]
So many places to go

[JACK]
So many places to go

[MORGAN, JACK, and ANNIE]
When you venture outside your window

[JACK (spoken)]
Oh, man! Remember riding the dolphins?

[ANNIE (spoken)]
Yeah! And visiting the tigers, and the kangaroos...

[JACK]
And the gorillas!

[ANNIE]
Awwww...I loved the gorillas!

[JACK]
Sailing on the Titanic!

[ANNIE]
That was really scary

[JACK]
The ghost town was scary, too

[ANNIE]
Yeah, and the twister, and the earthquake, and the volcano...

[JACK]
Yep. All scary

[ANNIE]
It was fun meeting Shakespeare, tough. And George Washington

[JACK]
And the pilgrims. And the Dragon King

[ANNIE]
And Clara Barton. And King Arthur

[MORGAN]
How far can you see

[JACK]
Yeah. King Arthur

[MORGAN]
From the top of a tree?

[ANNIE]
What was the very most fun for you?

[MORGAN]
So many places to go

[JACK]
Mmmm... I think I'd have to say Hawaii

[ANNIE]
Yeah, Hawaii was great

[MORGAN]
When you venture outside your window

[ANNIE]
We sure have been to a lot of places

[JACK]
Yep. I can't wait to find out where we'll go next...

Though we gotta say goodbye for the summer

And seal it with a kiss

Watch the jungle when its wet with rain
Just remember till youre home again

What you're doing to the man?

[Verse 2]
Do you see these tears here in my eyes?
Ain't no use in me lyin' 'cause I really cried
You think you're gonna take me and put me on the shelf
Girl, I'd rather die than see you with somebody else

[Chorus]
So throw it out of your mind
(Never gonna give you up)
I'll never leave you
(No matter how you treat me)
Though you grieve me and deceive me, mama yeah
(Never gonna give you up)
(So don't you think of leavin')

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?

[Verse 3]
My friends all say that I'm your fool
And you're using me like a carpenter uses a tool
And I know their intentions are all very good
Some of them would help me if they could

[Chorus]
(Never gonna give you up)
But I'll never, never, never, never, never let you go baby
(No matter how you treat me)
(Never gonna give you up) No matter what you say
(So don't you think of leavin')

[Post-Chorus]
Babe, don't you understand
That you're killing this man?

[Outro]
(Never gonna give you up)
Never gonna give you up
(No matter how you treat me)
No matter what you do to me, baby now
(Never gonna give you up)
(So don't you think of leavin')
One of these days I'll be standin' around your door
(No matter how you treat me)...

You broke his heart and made him cry
And he's been blue since then
Now he's found somebody new
And you want him back again

Foolish little girl, fickle little girl
You didn't want him when he wanted you
He's found another love, it's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do

""But I love him""
No you don't, it's just your pride that's hurt!
""I still love him""
If you got him back again, you'd go right out and do him dirt!

Foolish little girl, fickle little girl
You didn't want him when he wanted you
He's found another love, it's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do

""But I love him""
It's too late to have a change of heart!
""I still love him""
Tomorrow is his wedding day and you'll keep quiet if you're smart!

Foolish little girl, fickle little girl
You didn't want him when he wanted you
He's found another love, it's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do

Forget him cause he don't belong to you
It's too late he's found somebody new
There's not a single thing that you can do
