[Intro: André 3000]
Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Bridge: André 3000]
Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
""Look at the way he treats me""
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

[Chorus: André 3000]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

1,Bitch Please II,The Marshall Mathers LP,Eminem,2000-05-23,288200,68,"

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Yeah, what up, Detroit?
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh, no, he didn't
They didn't do it again (What-what, you what?)
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh, fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw, you smell that?
This is special right here (What-what, what-what-what?)
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie, baby, uh
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, ya know, what's crackin', Dre?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Just let me lay back and kick some old simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit, and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Best throw on ""Guilty Conscience"" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious (Watch out, nigga)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard, when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw
Is niggas from Crenshaw, from Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again (Shit)
You and what army could harm me?
D.R.E. and Shady with Doggy from Long Beach (Westside)
Came a long way to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long Uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare just bein' Andre
But I…

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Eminem]
Somehow, some way
Hello, nigga, you know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
And let me cut these niggas up and show 'em where the fuck I'm comin' from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin', son (Yeah)
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run (Watch out)
Got about fifty guns and I love
All of 'em the same, bang-bang (Word up)
Damn, baby girl, what's your name? (What's your name?)
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)
Hangin' in the club with my nephew Eminem (What's up, Slim?) What up, Cuz? (What up, Snoop?)
The Great White American Hope (Uh-huh)
Done hooked up with the king of the motherfuckin' West Coast, baby

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the façade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in a bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough, I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees
Come on

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Verse 4: Eminem & Snoop Dogg]
Aw, naw, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls (What?), dick six-inch long (Mm)
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady (He's so crazy!) (Ha-ha-ha)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird?
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That, somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here:
I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (A .44)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Snoop Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

[Intro]
Hot Shit (Hot Shit)

[Chorus]
Mmmmm, I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
(Come on!)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot Shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

[Verse 1]
Mmmmm, you can find me in St. Louis rolling on dubs
Smoking on dubs in clubs, blowing up like Cocoa Puffs
Sipping Bud', getting perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs and it's
All because accumulated enough scratch just to
Navigate it, wood decorated on chrome and it's
Candy painted, fans fainting while I'm entertaining
Wild, ain't it? How me and money get acquainted
I hang with Hannibal Lecter (Hot shit!)
So feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (What?), I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the 'cause, I'm righteous, above the law
Player my style's raw, I’m Born to Mack, like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour, give me D's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's Ebonics, gin, tonic, and chronic
Fuck Bionic, it's ironic, slamming niggas like Onyx
Lunatics till the day I die
And I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

[Chorus]
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
(Come on!)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot Shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

[Verse 2]
Who say pretty boys can't be
Wild niggas, loud niggas, O.K. Corral niggas
Foul niggas, run in the club and bust in the crowd, nigga
""How nigga?""
Ask me again and it's going down, nigga
Now nigga, come to the circus and watch me clown, nigga
Pound niggas, what you be giving when I'm around nigga
Frown niggas, talking that shit when I leave the town, nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now?
Hey, I'm ready to cut you up any day now
Play by my rules, boo, and you gon' stay high
May I answer your Third Question like A.I
Say hi, to my niggas left in the slamma
From St. Louis to Memphis, from Texas back up to Indiana
Chi-Town, K.C., Motown to Alabama
L.A., New York Yankee niggas, to Hotlanta
Louisiana, all my niggas with ""Country Grammar""
Smoking blunts in Savannah, blow thirty mil', like I'm Hammer

[Chorus]
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
(Come on!)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot Shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

[Verse 3]
Let's show these cats to make these
Millions so you niggas quit acting silly, mon
Kid quicker than Billy, mon, talking really and I need it mon
Flows, I kick 'em freely mon, especially off Remi, mon
Keys to my Beemer, mon, holler at Beenie Man
See me, mon, chiefin', rollin' deeper than any mon
Through Jennings mon, through U-City back up to Kingsland
With nice niggas, sheist niggas who snatch yo' life, niggas
Trife niggas who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga
(Hot shit!) Ice, niggas, all over, close to never sober
From broke to having brokers, my price-range is Rover
Now I'm knocking like Jehovah; let me in now, let me in now
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, let me in now
Spend now, I got money to lend my friends now
We in now, candy Benz, Kenwood and 10's now
I win now (Woo!), fucking lesbian twins now
Seeing now, through the pen I make my ends now

[Chorus]
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
(Come on!)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot Shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street, in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Got six model chicks, six bottles of Cris'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere

Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love to Hov' and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound

Yo what's Crip-a-lat'n, this big Snoop Dogg
Leave your name and your number at the motherfucking beep
If this one of my hoes, two-way me

[Dr. Dre]
Ay ay Snoop whattup, this your nigga Dre
Ay man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

[Snoop Dogg]
Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

[Butch Cassidy]
Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

[Goldie Loc]
Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

[Tray Deee]
Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hold they stare and act hard
That's even tho' your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

[Master P]
Whassup pimping, it's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it realer, cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me cause I'm a million dolla hitta
It's, No Limit til I D-I-E
C-P-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking

We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

[Verse 1: Nelly]
In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home) She can be
18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicy-thicy-thic girl you know that it's on
(You know that it's on) I peep something
Coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34, yelling
""I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there""

[Chorus: Nelly]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

[Verse 2: Nelly]
Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now, making a living off my brain
Instead of 'caine now, I got the title from my
Momma put the whip in my own name now, damn shit done
Changed now, running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White, c'mon

[Chorus: Nelly]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

[Bridge: Nelly]
Check, check, yo
I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won’t believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

[Verse 3: City Spud]
Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why, why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should, fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, ""wishing you was"" niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Chrissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty wanna... knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty wanna... rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty wanna... pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring, know they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish,"" come on boo, gimme kiss, c'mon

[Chorus: Nelly]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
Hey, must be the money!
Hey, must be the money!
Hey, must be the money!
Must be the money!
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?

Girl, it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a part of me
Mind, body and soul ain't no I in we (Baby)
When you cry, who wipes your tears?
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin' to fear?

Never hesitate knowing you can call on your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to

[Verse 2: Vita]
Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me, baby
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm?
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy, we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in July, it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy, put it on me

What would I be without you? (Uh)
I only think about you (Yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)

I only think about you (Yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (Lonely)
So baby girl, put it on me (Put it on me)

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Since we met, it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby, eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon' cry
If you leave me lonely
'Cause you not just my love, you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love?
I'm outta control, hold me, my love
'Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin' to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world, it'd be all yours, baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
'Cause every thug needs a lady (Yeah, yeah)
I feel you, baby, 'cause them eyes ain't lying
Wash away all the tears, there be no more crying (Baby)
And you complete me, and I would die if you ain't wit me
So baby girl, put it on me

8,What's Your Fantasy (Featuring Shawna),Back For The First Time,Ludacris,2000-01-01,275906,63,"

[Intro: Ludacris & Shawnna]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50-yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club, we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked, don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots, so they got to wait til the show stop
Or how about on the beach with black sand?
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man named Ludacris (woo!) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it, lover-lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I passed 'em
Get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and outlast 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em
While you stash 'em, I'll let 'em free
And they tell me what they fantasy
Like up on the roof, roof
Tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me!

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit; you give it up 'til they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know it got sold out!
A red carpet dick it just roll out
Go ahead and scream, you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train, when it's hot or when it's cold out
How about in the library on top of books?
But you can't be too loud!
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign
Let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name?
A sauna, jacuzzi, in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn
Rose petals on the silk sheets
Eating fresh fruits, sweep your woman right off her feet

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawnna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the back seat, windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up, fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex: make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown: that's the way that I like it, twerk
Legs jerk, overworked
Underpaid, but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team, off the ropes!
On the ocean or in the boat!
Factories or one hundred spokes!
What about up in the candy store?
That chocolate, chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream ""help!"" Play my game!
Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reins
School teacher, let me get my brains

[Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna]
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Go tell the DJ to put my shit on
I'm keeping you niggas and bitches in here jumpin' from the minute I get on
Taking they shirt off, showing they tattoos, screaming and hollering and all
Got the gift to come up with it, put it together, deliver, make 'em feel it, bitch, I been on
Sharp like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad like that student in the principal office
Put rappers in coffins, they dive like dolphins
I'm the damnedest, the lyrical marvel you don't come across often, so
Watch yourself
Or fuck around and get beside yourself, I know
Go 'head though, bounce them titties
Shake that ass, drop that pussy, but stay in line, ho
Fuck a can't, 'cause you can-can
Cocked up, head down, pussy popping doin' a handstand
Leave that pussy smoking (Ooh)
If you wanna do somethin', then bend over and bust that pussy open (Damn, ooh)

You looking good, mama, why, psh what's up, homie?
Sirens, limousines and the club owner, ya bitch, you
If you late, ain't no getting in this bitch 'cause it's filling up
Inside packed from the floor to the ceiling up
The building ain't big enough
I'm backstage bouncing, adrenaline building up
The pussy cutter, did I stutter?
The heart flutter, make your woman drawers melt like butter
Go down like Nelly, I'm hype like Belly
The rhyme seller, kick ass like Jim Kelly
Stand up, wild out, boot up and frown
Tell a nigga if he wanna try it then, bitch, come on down
No sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's the shit, then bitch, that's what it is

Been so long (Sing)

10,The Real Slim Shady,The Marshall Mathers LP,Eminem,2000-05-23,284200,83,"

[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Outro]
Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up!

[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]

[Verse 1]
(Yeah) I can drink a whole Henessey fifth
Some call that a problem but I call it a gift
Xzibit make the whole continent shift (hell yeah)
Invadin your territory in a blaze of glory
A soldier story, livin off nothin but instinct
Bitch niggas continue to floss and lip-sync
And I'mma just continue to flow, while rockin the boat
Probably smoke three-hundred thousand dollars in dope
Don't make my Desert Eagle barrel touch the back of your throat
Always approach niggas that's known for killin your folks
Be surprised who could turn around and bust on y'all
Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall
Bang holes through they coats and they Macy bags
No retaliation you basically runnin with fags
In these streets, you only good as your last transaction
Funny style, and these niggas ain't laughin
Y'all got it all fucked up in zero-zero
Think life is a video for ""Last Action Heroes""
Face the price you pay for the games you play
When it's all said and done at the end of the day, you gotta

[Hook X2]
Get your walk on, get your head tight
I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right
Get your bounce on, back dat ass up
Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up

[Verse 2]
Judge and jury, don't get your case dismissed
When I get pissed and smash through the makeshift
Uplift, dump this, make your shit knock
Hypnotical hardrock that don't flop
It's the best thing crackin my nigga
Lot of rappers talk of flashin the trigger but don't ever deliver
From the home of the toe tag, lowriders and body bags
Earthquakes police with automatics and nerve gas
Learn fast or get left behind quick (yeah)
You testify, you get wrapped in plastic (hell yeah)
Xzibit turn your SUV into a casket
Melt your body parts in a tub full of sulfuric acid
Drastic measures we take just to get by
For all the shit you gotta go through to get high
Stand by, do or die for the WestCoast!
Wanna fuck with Xzibit but can't come close motherfuckers

[Hook X2]
Get your walk on, get your head tight
I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right
Get your bounce on, back dat ass up
Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up

[Verse 3]
Tell y'all people to call my people
Recognize all men are not created equal
I'm lethal, all y'all faggots remain see-through
Only the kid from ""The Sixth Sense"" can peep you (DEAD PEOPLE!)
When I get through the World'll be a better place
A little Jesus Christ mixed with some Leatherface
Go find some punch to spike, find some dope to lace
Pull a pistol from my waist, nigga reach for space
Smack the taste out of your mouth if you talk shit
Or hit so hard to the chin it make your back flip
My transcript number one up in this conference
It's nonsense, all y'all niggas want is conflict
Only associate with pros and the convicts
Xzibit roll up in the spot with a bomb bitch
And then bounce with a couple, motherfuck a tussle
You never have enough muscle to stop a nigga hustle

[Hook X4]
Get your walk on, get your head tight
I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right
Get your bounce on, back dat ass up

With the platinum watches and the platinum rings (platinum rings)

Diamonds in my fuckin' teeth, when I talk, I spark
Don't fuck around with beef, when it start, I spark

See that new Monte Carlo, that's hot and on fire

And that Mercedes Wagon, with the kit, that's kitted out
Look like it got frog eyes

Lunatics.. is y'all ready?
Let me hear ya
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

[Verse 1]
I'm a sucker for corn rows and manicured toes (hey)
Fendi capri pants and Parasuco's (alright)
The rise of Diddy and City, with one or two throws
I'm draftin' 'em outta high school straight into the pros
Who knows? I know and I love it when you make your knees
Touch your elbows and break it down low to the Flo'
And there you go now throw it on me slow
And everytime I bust a rhyme, baby, ""Gimme Some Mo'""
You say you like that, when I hit it from behind and I'll be
Right back, yeah that's my very next line, I use it
Time after time, when I'm speakin' my mind
It's no matter if I'm shootin' game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her, ""Who that is, talkin' that shit about the 'tics?""
Somebody probably jealous 'cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin' shit like this
Should we apologize? Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, hey

[Chorus]
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I

[Verse 2]
We can gamble to the break of dawn, nigga, money long, nigga
Pass up the skirt to talk to the thong, nigga
Some say I'm wrong, but fuck it I'm grown, nigga
If you ain't 'bout money then best be gone, nigga
I'm flashy (uh), double takes when you walk past me
Nasty, don't be scared boo, go 'head and ask me
I drive fastly, call me Jeff Gord-on in the Black SS with the naviga-tion
See the joint blaz-on, somethin' smells amaz-on
I got a chick rollin' up, half black and Asi-an
Another one page-in, tellin' me to come home
Her husband on vacation and left her home alone
I used the V-12, powers; weight loss, powers
From Phat Farm to Iceberg Slim in one shower
Get a room in Trump Towers just to hit for 3 hours
Kicked the bitch up out the room 'cause she used the word ours, hey

[Chorus]
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night

[Verse 3]
Ayo, I smash-mouth a whole ounce, of that sticky
Wash my hands under a gold spout, when feelin' icky. Let
Go off in a ho's mouth, I ain't picky
Start frontin' when the shows out, whatchu mean?!
Twenty inches when they roll ouuuuuuut, come and get me
Big faces when they fold ouuuuuuut, is you wit me?
Don't make me pull that fo'-fo' ouuuuuuut
I keep it closer when the dough ouuuuuuut, then I
Slide up in the Escalade, me and E gettin' solid like the Ice Capades And me and Heezy, Frosty, Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy
You understand me, wrapped wrists like mummies
If you compare me to your local grocery, then
You'll see I got more karats than Aldi
More bread than aisle G, you can bag and scan me
Sure like Al B., meet the 'tics in Maui, hey

[Chorus]
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh what's poppin' tonight?
Andele andele, mami, E.I. E.I
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, if the head right, Nelly there ery'night

Uh, can you feel that?

Well pour out the Henn and Coke and fire up that dro'

I rock the shows; pop lock and knock yo nose
You Bia' Bia', I grab my .44 and mop the flo'
I Mop & Glo', the Feds tryin' to stop my dough
They claim they caught me at the docks with a flock of snow
I bring the pain, cock back and swing the thang
Yo' girl mad cause she told me don't even bring the thang
And then I told her, I said, ""it's cool, get at me""
And then my voice got raaaassspy
Cause I was smokin' on some Cali and my eyes were dazed

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
Bitch niggas in the house tell me what's up
A nigga slapped you in the mouth and told you shut up
Somebody holler get 'em and now you just a victim
Shorty tried to stick 'em, told the pit bull to sic 'em
I know he wanna run but he can't he assed out
Punched him in his chin and then he passed out
Woke up with his pockets turned inside-out
Always hit them weak motherfuckers right in they mouth
You better stay out the way and act like you ain't havin' shit
Cause niggas will run up in yo ass like you a nasty bitch
You little bitch, that's what the callin' you
You'd be a damn fool to act like you ballin' dude
Mindin' yo business, they grabbed you by yo collar
You feel like Marvin Gaye cause they make you wanna holler
But since you can't run, you might as well fight
Quit actin' like a bitch and live a real life
You just a ""Bia' Bia'!""

I'm a bad motha, shut yo' mouth, pull the drop out and
Creep at a low speed, 'cause homie probably know me
I push the pedal, thoughts of your stiletto
Way up in the air like I think he's here
'Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you (With you)
Homey be checkin' up on you (On you)

And my name is Jay-Z
She was all on my dick
Gradually I'm taking over your bitch
Coming over your shit
Got my feet up on you sofas, man
I mean a hostess for my open hand
You coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
I got your bitch up in my Rover man
I never kiss her, I never hold her hand
In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man
I'mma pimp her, it's over man
When I twist her in the Gold sedan
Like I'm Goldie man, you're bitch chose man
Jigga man, iceberg with the frozen hands
Wedding bands don't make it rosy man

[Missy]
Oh is that your chick
Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick
Keep licking her lips
Is that your chick?
Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thigh
Keep looking in his eyes
Oh is that your chick?
You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill
Don't you know that man kill?

Why she beeping him?
Keep praising him?
Cause that's Bleek and them, trick

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo check it now, yo, yo
Your hoe chose I

What I look like turnin' down chocha
Drove by, smokin' lye
Recognize a pimp, open your eyes
Hop in the passenger side of the ride
Damn Bleek, can't speak
Uh-huh, okay, what's up, SHUT UP
And close the door
Act like you been in the drop top
On the open road before
Fix your weave, then fix me
Ever gave head doing 160?
Ever seen a pair of kicks this crispy
How you love how the white wife beater fit me
M-dot, him hot, them not
(That's gangsta)

[Missy]
Oh is that your chick

Keep licking her lips

[Twista]
Tha Jigga and Twista got 'em screaming
Like a demon fiending for the semen
Chrome gleaming like the dome off Keenan
Gone while I'm leanin' smoking
I'm whip it in the stomach
Your bitch on the passenger side of me flashing your money
Why you acting so funny?
You know she been flirting while your working
Behind the curtain knuckles jerking for certain
Poppin' that pussy
Sweatin' till no fluid is left
When I come in the party with J we gonna do it to death
You gon' ruin your rep
Trippin' while we pimpin' these hefers
Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game don't stop
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put tha dick up inside her
Can't help it if she yellin' with a ridah

[Missy]
Oh is that your chick
Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick
Keep licking her lips

Yo, yo

Room 112, hotel balcony
How she say Jay you can call the house for me?
There's no respect at all
You betta check her dawg
She keep beggin' me to hit it raw
So she can have my kids and say it was yours
How foul is she? And you wifed her
Shit, I put the rubber on tighter
Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?
She got you whipped, got your kids
Got your home, but that's not your bitch
You share that girl, don't let 'em hear daddy Earl
It'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick
Ain't saving it, unfaithful bitch

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo how dumb the pimp?
I heard he trick
Bought a new five, maybe a six
Copped that for his new down bitch
And I was digging that down since '96 shit
Memph man I'll take your bitch
Let her do her thing, give brain in the whip
And you know how it go when it come to the hoes
She can do the same thing to the clique you know
Your hoe chose, don't get mad at me
Got your wife callin' me daddy
Put her out on the street let her get that cheese
My bad is that your freak
But you know how a thug do
When a nigga hit that, it's fuck you
Keep it snug, tre deuce in the boot
Niggas wanna act, get a motherfuckin' slug too

[Jay-Z]
Cool out homie
You betta keep her away from my balling clique
Keep her out of nightclubs all in the mix
From hanging out with chicks who be swallowing dicks
From catz who order Cris play the floor with the Knicks
That can only lead to something unfortunate
Hot boy like Jigga man scorch your bitch
Play the floor dot Jigga man go first
Then we all rock cause we all hot
You know the boys from the Roc got them whores on lock
Got them bitches in the smash
Making yours drive fast
Cause we get more cash than the average nigga
All dem hoes like damn I gotta have this nigga
Cause I'mma hot black, how in the hell can you stop that
You would fuck mine
How the hell can you knock that?
I'm just playing the cards choosenly
Jigga man who ya supposed to be?

What'chu like? (Can you tell me, baby?)
Why? How? All night long
(All night long, ah)

[Verse 1: Da Brat]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian with
Good conversation, plenty big faces
It's a must, I stay luxurious
Jewelry cut precision like I bust
Been winnin' since Funkdafied blew up
It's evident, shit, I can't be touched
Niggas say I'm too much, I trust it's true
Why lie? See for yourself when I slide through
Drive by, your bitch say don't look, you do
Shine so bright in the wet U2
You wish boo boo could ride with you tonight
Ain't nothin' in the world that Brat can't do
She attractive to them, him, her, and you, shit
Frostbit, December, Unrestricted
Drop dead, the cost is priceless
Due to the content, I suggest you'll like this

[Chorus: Tyrese]
What do you like?
A whole lot of foreplay

You on the bottom, tight body

Wow, know how to all night long
All night long, tell me

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
Wassup? The setting, a hot-ass club
And you still be sweating me
I don't see nothin' wrong with givin' a little love
But nigga, just let me breathe
Damn, you cute as hell, so let's switch the digits
Then I got to leave
And you can buy me a couple of drinks
But I'ma go socialize and smoke my weed
And I like it when you keep your eyes on me
And I like it when you touch my privacy
And I like it, sex and ecstasy
When the belt buckle loosen up, undress me
Already juiced up, that come naturally
Wax on and off so romantically
No woman can slow dance or throw down like I can
Ask if you curious to know what I like, man

[Chorus: Tyrese]
What do you like?
A whole lot of foreplay
Right before you get it started
What do you like?

Somebody that can make you say
Wow, know how to all night long
All night long, tell me

[Verse 3: Da Brat]
(Let me tell you somethin')
Well, I start at the top of the list
With my pretty eyes, a cute nose and these fat-ass lips
My medallion sit in the middle of my tits
It's hit after hit, shit, sweet every sip
Down to the last drip drop, watch the hips rock
Color Me Badd, tick-tock, you don't stop
Till the thick thighs, dick rise when I skip by
I ain't surprised I'm what'chu like, nigga

[Chorus: Tyrese]

Me on top
You on the bottom, tight body
What do you like?
Somebody that can make you say
Wow, know how to all night long
All night long, tell me

[Pimp C]
This game fucked up, I ain't got no friends
I done spend my last 70,000 dollars on a drop-top Benz
Ugh, and I'm a trill nigga
Down to put a forty-five to his Hilfiger
Lay it down muthafucka because I'm bustin' for mine
Pack that iron every time and I ain't trying' dyin'
Niggas down in Port Arthur (huh nigga what?)
Thank that I'm playin? (huh nigga what?)
Bust 17 times and let 'em feel what I'm sayin'
UGK and C-Murder
Cadillac and a Tank (Master P)
Bout to fade the platinum
Smoke some dank and some drank
But bitch luv me when I come to your city
Serve my dick out her pussy
And bust my nuts on her titties
Ugh, it's just a matter of time before I'm up in your house
With my mask on my face and my thang in your mouth
Now get your mind right nigga (mind right) and make a pimp rich
And never put trust in a trick ass bitch (trick ass bitch)

[Hook 4X]
I'm bout ta pull akickdoe! (ugggggggghhhhhh!)
Lay down on the flo' (flo')
Want the G's and the money or everybody gotta go (gotta go)

[Bun B]
They try to run up in the manger (run up)
The home of Bun B
I see me P and C in danger (danger)
Just like the ATF, Feds, DPD, and Texas Rangers
Fuckin' with me and my Mddl Fngz
But to this shit nigga we ain't strangers
Pull high-calibers and magnums
Gotta gage these pistols
Hand grenades, and land mines
Chopper pipe bombs and missiles
Some of them bitches whistle
Some of them bitches silent
But all them bitches handle they business
All of them violent
Bout it bout it and dangerous
Soldiers that wanna gang with us
Do you thang with us, hang with us
Get that No Limit slang with us
I came to bust every ass in my way till it's over
So get the chip off your shoulder
Fix your lip
I done told yah
We hold you hostage in your own apartment complex
Nigga I can see that you got plex
Sit down and take a time trip
This ain't nothin' ta sneeze at
The fear in your eyes I see
Bitch where's the key's & g'z at?

[Hook 2X]

[C-Murder]
Lay it down muthafucka
Everybody gotta go
Give me the loot is what I tell 'em
When I kick in the doe'
Nigga I'm mad at the world
For my lack of havin' papers
Fuck the law and the cops
Cuz I'm down for my gangsters

[Master P]
Some say we dangerous
Especially when broke
I'm mo daily than a dope fiend fiendin' for dope
I just live for confetti
You see I'm dangerous like Freddy
You see I run through your house and leave it messy like Betsy

[C-Murder]
I got too much stress in my head
I wanna take my own life
My last chance is a 211
But it got me thinkin' twice
It's a drought right now
So these drugs ain't happenin'
And if it wasn't for No Limit
There'd be no money in rapping

[Master P]
You see my boy had an apartment full of keyz and g'z
The word on the street is his homie told his baby momma to freeze!
You see you can't trust nobody in this dope game
Keep your eyez on your enemies
Stack some chips and get out man

[C-Murder]
Give me a ski-mask, a 9
I'll be a down ass nigga
And watch me pull a flea-flicker
And make my g's get bigger
If I get caught I'm gettin 25, but that don't mean shit
Cuz if I go to jail it's gotta be better than living like this
Nigga 2 shots in the air
Cuz I ain't bout bein' broke
And if you bout I make a move
Nigga, everybody gotta go
Just some bout it niggas from New Orleans
With tapes hooked up
C-Murder, Master P, and UGK
Now Nigga what?

20,Batter Up,Country Grammar,Nelly,2000-06-27,327933,53,"

[Intro]
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
This is Mark, oh-who-gives-a-fuck from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah, yeah, yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game
And now.. please rise for the singing of our national anthem

[Chorus: Nelly]
Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

[Verse 1: Ali]
I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god livin; like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sittin' strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand, baby, where the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today?
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fuckin' with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league
'Cause we's be in the big league

[Chorus: Nelly]
Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

[Verse 2: Nelly]
Well you should see me now, I'm eatin' Wheaties now
I'm stealin' second and third, lookin' home, gettin' greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for runnin' the quickest miles
Hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thang
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

[Chorus: Nelly]
Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

[Interlude]
Well uhh this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah, I heard that)
(It's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows
Mur-uhh, Murphey Lee or somethin)

[Verse 3: Murphey Lee]
I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'm a sixteen-year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you somethin' now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rappin'
Money, money, money, money what's happenin'
I'm comin' up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with, you know how we do
We do, we do, we do, we do, we do

[Chorus: Nelly]
Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

21,The Way I Am,The Marshall Mathers LP,Eminem,2000-05-23,290426,70,"

[Segue from ""Steve Berman (Skit)""]
...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone
Fuck it, shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

22,X,Restless,Xzibit,2000-04-02,255640,60,"

[Intro: Xzibit]
Yeah! Ladies and gentleman
Broadcastin' live to you and yours
It's Mr. X to the Z, Xzibit
Yeah, bouncin', c'mon

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
The first day of the rest of my life
X stand behind the mic like Walter Cronkite
Y'all keep the spotlight, I'm keepin' my rhymes tight
Lose sight of what you believe and call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to
Teflon territory you just can't shoot through
You gon' shoot who? (Who?) Not even on your best day
Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leavin' the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut, now we break through in the rut
Hennesey and orange juice baby fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while the pistol range
Goin' up and down my dick like the stock exchange

[Chorus: Xzibit & (Dr. Dre)]
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Ever since Xzibit could spit, been on some pimp shit
Approach every woman like a potential mistress
Shine bright, make sure that X stay tight
Cause tonight I might meet my next ex-wife
Mr. Big Chief Reefer, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it through and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Borrow your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen
I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin'
Rockin' chains, stadiums, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop-top tinted on twenties
Usin' rappers like crash test dummies, stackin' real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight when you thinkin' right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

[Chorus: Xzibit & (Dr. Dre)]
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
What an event, we hardcore a hundred percent
Makin' it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck, demand the respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me
Seem like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stab a track, strangle the beat - Restless, no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grimm
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)
Call Doc, bounce to the spot and slide right in
I ain't tryin' to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennessy, rock plenty of ice, make it a double, and scream

[Chorus: Xzibit & (Dr. Dre)]
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around

So there you have it - A-B-C, D-P-G-C
X to the motherfuckin' Z
Mr. Xuberant, Xtravagant, Xtrordinary, Xciting, X-a-lotta
XO with a little bit of Xtacy
X-ing your bitch-ass out if you tryin' to test the G
And what's the recipe? Xcalibur weaponry
And we shoot Xceptionally
That there is hot - X marks the spot?
Fuck naw, X spots the marks
Xclamation point, niggas!

Now tell me who want to fuck with us?
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I bang - and let your fuckin brains hang, snitches
Fuck all them able bitches with riches
Who carry 22's, up in they hosiery
A black teller when my father bust and unloaded me
Think he just finished sniffin a ki, and dippin the D's
Don't hate me, hate Nicky Barnes for hittin my moms
Letting the condom pop, nigga I was born in the drop
Coke boil in the pot, shake the Feds
And bust shots at them street cops
Fuck yo' point is? My point is double fours at your fuckin jaws
Pointed, hollow point shit
Four-point-six, need I say more?
Or do you get the point bitch? C'mon
What type of nigga slang and bang in the streets? (Bad Boyz)
What type of nigga stay in the Trump for weeks? (Bad Boyz)
What type of nigga fly Bentley Coupes? (Bad Boyz)
Aim for the sky, cop the shit then shoot ..
[Shyne]
Minks draggin on the floor - bangin on your whore
Suckin the croissant just examine it for flaws
Pour the Cristal on the way to trial, RICO law
Got a nigga head hurtin squirtin til they pull the curtain
Let the money drip dry, hundred dollar bills
Wipe the tears from my eyes, no love
Fuck y'all niggas, hope you die a slow death
As I coke-test and see the lawyers talk of protest
Can't fuck with you weak rap niggas, witcha gay raps
Runnin 'round talkin this and talkin that
See me in the streets, tried to give me dap
Andrew Cunanan ass niggas
My two cannons blast niggas, ass niggas
Got me fucked up in the game, get your shirt stained
Keep your five mics nigga, give me the 'caine
Do the shit to clean my money dummies, gleamed the wrist out
Cop the pist-al, nigga, talk shit now, uh
What type of nigga slang and bang in the streets? (Bad Boyz)
What type of nigga stay in the Trump for weeks? (Bad Boyz)
What type of nigga fly Bentley Coupes? (Bad Boyz)
Aim for the sky, cop the shit then shoot ..
[Shyne]
Bling bling, it's a Bad Boy thing
Bullets heat-seekin, streep sweepin, with an evil grin
Watch you die, one love, one life, one Shyne
Y'all niggas ain't sayin nothin, like a mime
Every line, I live it, I write it with a pencil so niggas die
Of lead poison if they bite it, hate it but recite it
It's a G thang, me and Puff in St. Bart's set it off
Bitches walkin topless with G-strings, menage'
Bust shots at your crew, another charge
As the gulf stream fly through the fog
Make ya popular
Pockets filled with more high notes than the opera
Franklins on top of the - Jacksons
My nigga Ty leave you tired
Bad Boy, repsect it or die, coward
What type of nigga slang and bang in the streets? (Bad Boyz)

Fuck-ass, dick-in-the-booty-ass, K-Y Jelly-packing-ass nigga
Smoke something, bitch
You better get your bitch ass up off the street, nigga
You got five seconds to get your hating ass up outta here
Pouring up and showing up, bitch
Cause it's some trill-ass niggas in this motherfucker
Yeah, nigga, y'all know the motherfucking sco'
Y'all non-snorters, non-smokers, non-sippers
Get the fuck up out of here, bitch
Nigga, it's some sipping-ass, pouring up-ass, smoking-ass
Getting high-ass niggas in here, Three 6, UGK, nigga

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
I'm trill, working the wheel, a pimp, not a simp
Keep the dope fiends higher than the Goodyear Blimp
We eat so many shrimp, I got iodine poisoning
Fuck niggas make me sick with all that pinching and bargaining
You say that you a boss, I ain't believing that shit
You got the funny Geneva watch, with the Ferrari kit
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us
I got the red promethazine, thick orange, and yellow tuss
Hydrocodone on the hands-free phone
The '84 Brougham on them blades, twenty-inch chrome
If you got sixteen, you can get a bizzerd
I'm choking on that doja sweet and sipping on that sizzurp

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
Some niggas scared to flaunt it, some niggas, they want it, want it
Some niggas, they joning, joning, but I be fucked up, up on it
We're with the Mafia 6, and we ain't 'bout that bullshit
If we gon' get high, we gon' get high and we gon' house a bitch
Two niggas all at the mouth, two niggas all at the ass
And plus, that syrup have a nigga dick hard all night and she cool with that
She popped her a pill of X, and drank on some orange juice
And just when you thought she was freaking, she done got super loose
Niggas come in by threes and deuces, all in circles like duck-duck-goose
All that want it can bone it, she on that X and that tootie fruit
Forty dollars for just one ounce, Tussionex is how it's pronounced
Niggas sipping and dipping and tripping, man, I'm 'bout all out

[Chorus: Project Pat]
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
People always asking me, ""Is the Three 6 high on that?""
Rolling on them X pills, stuttering, pup-pup powder packs
Wh-wh-where the weed at? Ain't like that we need that
NyQuil will slow me down, something that keep me easy
Nothing like that yella yella, that'll have you itching, man
Talking like, ""What's up, fool?"" Vocal cords sounding lame
In my days, all we did was chief out on a quarter pound
Gone on coke, eyes all bucked, this here shit'll knock you down
Knock you out, make you fall asleep when you're on them wheels
Ain't no doubt, hit me when I beep for this refill
Once again, on my weekly high, gotta have that drank
Yeah, my nig, y'ain't know? I feel like I'm gon' fucking faint

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Nigga, tell me what you know 'bout Frank, Nito, and Young Guido
Paul and Vito, we play a tune that's sweeter than Pedito
With my Three 6 niggas pouring up in my southern credo
Quick, fast, we'll put it on your ass like John Bido
Cause you fronting rap sangers, be creamy like a Zinger
You ain't from the manger, boy, but you gets the middle finger
Humdanger, rum dranker, occasionally take
Your bitch to the telly and be a dick and cum slanger
When Big Bun come danger, nigga, ring your alarm
Sexy thang on my arm, cup of drank in my palm
And that crazy shit, I'm tripping on some skinny bitches
Something that's wholesome, Florida to Folsom
For the most, I'm steady sipping on some, sipping on some

[Chorus: Project Pat]
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip

Good lookin out Timbaland, y'know?
[Timbaland]
Uh-huh
What?
Uh-huh
What?

[Timbaland (Eve)]
I need a ryde or die bitch
(I like to rock Prada suits and my ass is fat)
I need a ryde or die bitch
(I push a Cadillac truck with my friends in the back)
I need a ryde or die bitch
(Smoke 'dro, drink liquor, like to fuck 'til I cum)
I need a ryde or die bitch
(I rock a icy ass chain with a earring in my tongue)

[Jadakiss]
Ha
Yo, yo, yo
Yeah, what's up ma, what's going on, I know you know 'Kiss
The nigga with the hot flow and a cold wrist
Can flow always, sit on 4 K's
Then wait for a drought and flood 'em with all 'dres
Ryde or die chick, hand do a B.I
Give a nigga up north some ass on a V.I
And she blackout when she in the mall
Got the brand new spring Prada shit in the fall
Don't matter what size panties, fitting her small
And she don't got no problem hittin' us all
And she said she got a man, but he in the fed
And she miss him so much that she pee in the bed
So you know I had to lighten her raw, fighting the dog
Pushing the seat back gettin' right in the fall
Make her use a fake credit card twice in a store
Might make you do it tomorrow you triflin' whore

[Styles Paniro]
I need a chick that ryde or die, pullin' the 5
Gettin' high with the Gucci frames over her eyes
Sweet to the tail, still won't fuck in the Benz
Cause she bought me a Polo coat and a couple of Timbs'
Doobie was rap, both in the movie with gats
Gave me head cause the movie was wack, word
Toasted her crib, blow in the fridge, she needed to work
I died and that bitch gon' put weed in my hearse
Gamed her to death, tattooed my name on her neck
You don't wanna see me bangin' the left, hittin' the gas
That bitch out the window poppin' heat in yo' ass
You could catch Holiday in a Holiday Inn
With a bad bitch swallowin' gin, word
And if it got to do with money count Holiday in
With my ryde or die bitch that'll body your man
You don't like me as a artist, she gon' body your fam'

[Sheek Luchion]
Uh, uh, yo
Yo, when you see Sheek, don't look at me as Sheek from The L.O.X
Look at me as that cat that know how to box
Know about Glocks, know about slingin' them rocks
Know about runnin' from cops and switchin' up spots
How to get rich, know about thuggin' a bitch
Fuck 'em in the park, fuck a sweet as the Ritz
They like that shit, and I ain't gotta spend no checks
Fuck diamonds, all they really want is rough ass sex
And they name, shout it out when I'm up at Flex
I get drunk with bitches that don't get drunk
Don't get high, have 'em doing drive-by's
Shit they never did, forgetting about they kids
Moms babysitting, ain't seen her in a week
I'm a bad influence to parents that hate Sheek
I need a ryde or die bitch that'll take this coke
Out of town, and come back and breakdown when I'm broke, what

""Go for mine, and run down the line""

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I went from construction Timbs to Ac's with rims
Flipping mixtapes to bitches feeding me grapes
Peep my mind state, Big Poppa flow is lethal
That weed make my ass wanna kill four people
Fuck the game, gimme the dame and the Range
My niggas up to pawn drop-top Jaguars
Blindfold you when you step in the car
That's that superstar status apparatus, more wins than Cassius
Cease roll the hash, it's in the pocket with the nine
Roll up the whole dime as my seats recline
I want a presidential Rollie (So)
So I crush MCs to guacamole, making Robin scream, ""Holy moley!""
Big Poppa, fuck a cape, I'm that Paper Crusader
Playing Sega in the wide body Blazer

[Verse 2: Coolio]
I shot dice with a priest and drank yak with a pastor
So it's me, myself and I know, my own lord and master
When your ass was born, it was all on the lone, and
When it's time to die, you'll be all alone, so
Open up your mind, ball up your knuckle bone, and
Start taking care of your own, nigga
Everybody's human with the nature of a sinner
So I look inside myself to gather strength from the inner
I gots to fight back against the powers that be
Cause the powers that be, be tryna fight me
Standing at the crossroads but I wasn't by myself
Some take the right and some take the lefts, but
Lo and behold what do I see
In the distance? Some resistance

[Verse 3: Redman]
It's that Funkadelic Funk Doctor Spock, inhale it
Fuck the vest, niggas better start putting on helmets
I roam the streets where there's no peace, relax
Funk coming in stacks, bullets humming from gats
So I duck, lyrical BUCK BUCK, get stuck
I'm jamming like Smuckers for all you motherfuckers
That cause the ruckus, then I fix a few stitches
BLADOW! Plus my style pack like Luke bitches
I forward, forward, high punch and spit the flame
Like Liu Kang, burning your membranes when the wind change
Mad explicit when splifted, my scriptures
Leaving your mic boney like that Tales Of The Crypt bitch (Uh!)
All y'all niggas suck my balls one time
While I unwind, I'm busting your ass, counterclockwise
I get Dumb but Dumber, why your vision blurred
For all the loo-hoo-ooh-sers

[Verse 4: Ill Al Skratch]
Ayo, Mayday, mayday, raise the white flag
Let the pants sag, fuck the drag (I'm a puff the whole bag)
It's the low down and I'm low-key, the O.G
Niggas know me (True) so take it easy with stakes

[Verse 5: Big Mike]
It ain't surprising these motherfuckers still hating
They must don't know I ain't that nigga to be played with
It's been stated way back in '88
That a nigga like Mike will stomp the head of a snake
Now quakes was felt when my feet hit the ground
And fate is fatal when my heat made a sound
Now, how did I relate what's gonna fall
When my niggas made the fucking final call

[Chorus: Ill Al Skratch]
It ain't no sunshine, it ain't no sunshine
It's like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like that

Hey, you, don't you dare give me no type of argument
All these devils are mad because we be the most dominant
Hey, hit you with fatness, represent my blackness
Run up on devils like a savage in pursuit of happiness
You best believe every time we come, we come hard
The undisputed truth is that the black man is God
Now every time I turn around, my people start subtracting
They cause this shit, then they wonder why we start overreacting
Hey, ay, ay, you can pick and choose it
Right before you lose it, I'm a hit you with my music
I'm frying up shit sizzling like cyanide
Watch me go inside, ""Please give me room, yo step aside""
Ha, those who commit the ultimate crimes
Bitches run around like snitches out there dropping dimes
Get your shit drawers up out my hammer
Young survivalist represent the next Black Panther

[Verse 7: Buckshot]
I stepped in the jam with the guard on my side
And the guard S.T. is still waiting in the ride
So I stepped to the DJ and told the DJ
""Yo, throw the wax on"" ""How many emcees must get dissed""

[Verse 8: Layzie Bone]
Putting your shit to the pave, ending 'em meeting the gauge
Live in the land of the brave, crazed, dazed, gotta blaze, amazing, nothing phased
Bone, my deadly fist of brothers, ruggish, never did take no losses
Put 'em all in a coffin, you dearly departed, better off

[Verse 9: Wish Bone]
Living the psycho path so I'm down with a buck and a blast and getting my chance
You niggas are fearing my sawed-off
Blew thee to rest, so fast to blast
So if you, thinking defeat, you need, to best, be packing your shit, you bitch
Not that it makes a difference, cuz, when we a done with the quickness

[Verse 10: Krayzie Bone]
Now Krayzie Bone is buck, buck, bucking em once a
Gain enough to pick a defender
They try to contend us, see, all they gon' win is that Mac-10
There's never another to go with a brother, while smotherin' suckas been gon' undercover
We leave em in gutters, ain’t gonna get caught. But who was the sucker that squealed on a murda?

[Verse 11: Bizzy Bone]
Creep with the street, sweeper, better R.I.P. and pray
The bullet don't put in much work but I'm a sure, with, shot
Puttin' the bullets just where it hurts, and um
With a me tech'll slip up one on the popos, Bone, Bone
Better be nothing to me, you set up, wet up
Get 'em on the get up, Bone won't let up

While my peoples is poppin' bottles up in Sue's Rendevous
Fuck that! Spun the U-ey, lost a hubcap
It's back to the shack, came back in a ""What's that?""
Straight from Paris, checkin' Gaby's new baby carriage
Perry Ellis, auburn cherry reddish
Fresh out the dealer, got the TEC for the squealers
Wear a vest for the killers, nothin' less, ‘cause it's realer
In the Big Apple, where it's quick to get your shit tackled
Enemies spit at you, best friends kidnap you
Trust no one; got beef, bust yo' gun
You don't need no one talking 'bout that you owe him
I'ma go for dolo; Scarface without Manolo

[Verse 1: M-1]
One thing bout music when it hit you feel no pain
White folks say it controls your brain
I know better than that, that's game
And we ready for that
Two soldiers head of the pack
Matter fact, who got the gat?
And where my army at?
Rather attack than not react
Back to beats, it don't reflect on how many records get sold
On sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
Whether your project's put on hold
In the real world; these just people with ideas
They just like me and you when the smoke and camera disappear
Again the real world; it's bigger than all these fake-ass records
When poor folks got the millions and my woman's disrespected
If you check 1-2, my word of advice to you is just relax
Just do what you got to do; if that don't work then kick the facts
If you a fighter, rider, biter, flame-ignitor, crowd-exciter
Or you wanna just get high then just say it
But then if you a liar-liar, pants on fire, wolf-crier, agent with a wire
I'm gon' know it when I play it

MC's get a little bit of love and think they hot
Talking bout how much money they got;
Nigga, all y'all records sound the same
I'm sick of that fake-thug-R&B-rap-scenario, all day on the radio
Same scenes in the video
Monotonous material
Y'all don't hear me though
These record labels slang our tapes like dope
You can be next in line and signed and still be writing rhymes and broke
You would rather have a Lexus or justice?
A dream or some substance?
A Bimmer, a necklace or freedom?
Still a nigga like me don't playa-hate, I just stay awake
This real hip-hop
And it don't stop 'til we get the po-po off the block
They call it...

[Chorus: dead prez]
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop

[Outro: dead prez]
DPZ got that crazy shit
We keep it crunked-up, John Blazed and shit
Uh, DPZ got that crazy shit we keep it crunk up
John Blaze'd and shit what
Uh, DPZ got that crazy shit we keep it crunk up

[Intro: André 3000]
One, two
One, two, three, yeah!

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (Whoo!)
Like a million elephants or silverback orangutan
You can't stop the train
Who want some don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Bet I'll be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9 Anno Domini, anything goеs
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequеnces are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell (Hot!)
Get a life now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer
Soul gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always more (Ha!)

[Chorus: André 3000 + Morris Brown College Gospel Choir]
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend dying to geek
OutKast bumpin' up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac, 'bout 5 niggas deep
75 MCs freestyling to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Should've bought an ounce, but cha copped a dub
Should've held back, but cha throwed the punch
Supposed to meet your girl but cha packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, ""Control""
Like Janet, Planet, Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pity pat rappers trying to get to five
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride (Ha!)

[Chorus: André 3000 + Morris Brown College Gospel Choir]
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!

Bombs over Baghdad!
Bombs over Baghdad!

Shit
Feel this

If your hoped we wouldn't make it, fuck you (fuck you)
Talk with a heart full of hatred, fuck you (fuck you)
And you said we wouldn't cake it, fuck you (fuck you)
Only my man blood is sacred, cocksucker, fuck you

Yo, everybody's a snake
That's why I try to keep the grass cut
So I can see 'em when they coming
Then I heat they ass up
'Cause' them niggas that you went to school with
Will catch you while you in your new whip
And turn your brains into Cool Whip
Niggas that you running round getting ass with
Ain't gon' help you do nothing but carry your casket
Got the nerve to ask Kiss why I smoke so much
And how I'm such a young nigga that seem to know so much
While you was running round pumping for niggas
I was listening
And you still pumping for niggas
I'm coming through visiting
You heard, L-O-X came through in a yellow Lex
And hop out with the Air Force One's with yellow checks
And you liable to see me Dolo, icing the Rolo
Burner under the Polo, a lot of y'all is homos
Funny style niggas never down with me
Type that go to the bathroom, sit down and pee
I'll empty your house, back of your cribs, smacking your kids
Bullets going through your leather, cracking your ribs
Don't even hit me on my hip if I ain't give you a call
And I ain't got a home phone number, I live on the road
Now I'm getting bigger checks, conference calls with bigger 'xecs
Bigger bracelets with bigger begets
Fuck y'all

All I do is get high, and think of faving you all
Motherfuckers hit 'cha knees and just pray to the Lord
I'd rather die today than live tomorrow
Then watch you crab motherfuckers just steal and ball
Put in my work, you might get put in a church
Funeral time, everybody kissing the corpse
Learn the ropes, stone rip if you soft, you pissing me off
Call me S.P., and I spit on your boss
You can die cause this shit might happen to me
But I'mma still happen to be, packin' the three
Fuck with bitches that be wrappin' the keys
And the niggas that bug over drug money, clappin' the D
Shoot in the breeze, nine in the boot, full of trees
One in the morning, catch me with a gun on the corner
Let you know it's all real and you can front if you want to
I understand, fuck it dog, die in the can
I say you pussy, you won't die for your right-hand man
As well as your left, niggas trip, fell into death
They touch you, only thing else to say is fuck you

A-yo, y'all niggas ain't hardcore, all my niggas is homicide
What you know about getting shot, letting the drip dry
Letting the spit fly, seeing sparks whiz by
Putting a MASH on niggas like Klinger and Horgi
So soft you smushy, I blast 'til your shit is gushy
Should be the head Cat in the Broadway play, you pussy
Fuck with Sheek, Ouija board spell ""Death""
You can talk that beef shit, I hope that deep shit
Be as deep as you inside the fucking cement
Or you can deep sea dive, with no scuba gear
I'll drown you with your snorkel on, bitch, breathe out of there
Whole team rich, never seen a summer like this
Baking hot, and you can sled ride down my wrist, neck, and hand
When it comes to coke, I can make a snowman, shit
Play in this shit make a angel with it
And I don't give a fuck about that 380 that y'all share
Between the 10 y'all with the same 8 bullets from last year
When I bust I use snubs, denim flee in the spot
The hand I write with need a oven glove, my shit so hot
I want the most, Roley only work when it's next to my post
Fuck a present gimme a yacht master, regular bezzy
Then I'm good when I'm in the hood and I'm on the block
You got a gut feeling about shit, nigga, that means you shot, what

If you hoped we wouldn't make it, fuck you
Talk with a heart full of hatred, fuck you
And you said we wouldn't cake it, fuck you
Only my man's blood is sacred, cocksucker, fuck you

I'll tell you in your face, fuck you
Pull it off my waist, hit you up, fuck you
And watch you die on the street, fuck you
Whoever feel sad at the funeral, fuck them too

Drinkin Henn and acting like it do something to me

Shit, relax your mind, let your conscience be free
You're now rollin' with them thugs from the R-O-C
Sigel-Sigel in the house! Uh-huh, sick bastard (Yeah)
Get your wig pushed back by the wig push-back-er (Ugh, ugh)
Memph' Bleek in the house! Still here, never left (Ugh, ugh)
Still bust, more or less, still puff, BITCH! (Ugh, ugh)
Young Hova in the house—Jigga! (Yeah)
Cris' sipper, six-dipper, wrist-glitter, nigga!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & Beanie Sigel]
Hold up, love
Every time you see Jiggaman, I'm rolling on dubs
Don't forget about them blades, shit, chopping it up
It's the motherfucking Roc, bitch, who hotter than us?
Jay-Hov, 'bout to change my name to Jay Peso
But in the meantime, call me William H., though
On the platinum Yamaha, got the engine gunning
Throwing it up like liquor on an empty stomach
{*Cycle whizzes by*} Y'all don't hear nothing?
Who that, Mack? Naw, dawg, that's M. Bleek coming

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek & Jay-Z]
Who the FUCK! want! what?!
Catch Bleek in South Beach out of the reach of the police
Gat on my lap (Yeah), bitch on my back (Holla)
'Gnac in my pocket, smoking that sticky chocolate (Ooohwee!)
Holler if you want drama with...
The Dynasty; Amil, Bleek, Jigga, and...

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Sigel—Desert Eagle, dawg, who else but me?
Roc Airs, Roc-Wears, bandannas and white tees
Me without a gun, dawg? Unlikely
You know I keep the heat right under the wife-beat'
Three-X tee, I'm Lincoln now, you can't see the pound
Got a little gut, so the gat sit tucked (Fuck...)
I run wild, gun high, L.A. style
Bang the Roscoe 'til the sunrise; plus, I stay dumb high
Whether block shit or rock shit
Club shit or drug shit, I pop shit—I got shit
Get Sig' any track, I'ma spit the talk to it
Down South gon' bounce; Crips gon' walk to it
Get a ounce, get a woods, everybody spark to it
Every dawg, every Blood in the hood, bark to it
Get the ounce, get the 'Woods, everybody spark to it
We can smoke in here, put the choke in the air (Yeah)

[Chorus: (Static Major), Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel, & Memphis Bleek]

Cris' sipper, six-dipper, wrist-glitter, nigga! (Yeah)

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
I wear more bling to The Source and Soul Trains
More chains than rings, niggas won't do a thing
I bangs the four-four in plain daylight; I'm deranged
Spray right at your brain; by the way, this is Hov
One-shot Dillinger, one shot killing you
It's only one Roc La Familia
Sigel lock Philly up, Brooklyn is me
Matter-fact, the East Coast—fuck took it from me?
Fourth album, still Jay, still spitting that real shit
Volume 3, still sold more records than Will Smith
Can't call this a comeback, I run rap, the fuck is y'all saying?
Five million? I done that, and I've come back
To do it again! (Uh-huh)
Ex-sinner, Grammy Award winner
Balling repeatedly, highlights on SportsCenter
Please repeat after me—it's only one rule:
I will not lose!

Yeah, you pronounce my name (Kweli), any questions?
I bring many blessings with my man Hi-Tek
And he from the Natti (Natti)
We make the sky crack, feel the fly track
Get your hands up like a hijack
Fists in the air for (Kweli)
Keep 'em there like
Natural mystic or smoke when the spliffs lit
It's a revolutionary (Party) word
They ask me what I'm writin' for
I'm writin' to show you what we fightin' for
Say ""Tah-leeb"" or ""Talib"" (Talib)
If it's hard, try spellin' it phonetically
If not, then just Let It Be like Nina Simone
You probably (Probably) don't listen, B
Even when we suffer losses, I count the victories

""Stop cryin', be strong for your momma"" is what I had to say

Back in the day when me and moms first parted
Hi-Tek from the beginnin', I stayed advanced
A young chameleon, adapt to any circumstance
Peep game, nigga, never been a lazy nigga
Stayed on my hustle, concentrate to get the paper bigger
Stay focused, while other cats stay hopeless
While niggas stay high, I stay lower
Stackin' my chips to get a foreclosure
This shit ain't over
Goin' for the gusto, keep getting that provo
It's Hi-Tek (and Kweli) on the track like Flo-Jo
Bet you ain't even know I had flow, though

Say my name, say my name (Kweli), like Destiny's Child
Shine bright like my girl heavenly smile
Or a suit on Steve Harvey (Harvey)
We tighter than them jeans that huggin' black hips 70's style

Who you know who can spit at the Sig

[Hook]
Nigga the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth

[Verse 2: Beanie Mac]
Ain't nothin changed with Sig I'm still stuck in the kitchen
So what I'm signed, that's fine still stuck in position
You motherfuckers know me well, couple court cases from jail
Couple 4-4 shells from hell
Stuck on this mission, go home, my girl fussin and bitchin
Motherfucker won't you change your life, I'm thinkin
Motherfucker won't I change my wife
Ignorant bastard laughin like fuck the rap shit
It's just another hustle, another way for niggas to touch you
Now they know the face of Beans
Now they, see my face on screens and I ain't even chase this dream
I feel sorry for those who did
Y'all niggas can't stop the BOL, whether rock or raw
I'm slingin coke in a Roc velour
You niggas know what block I'm on, Glock in palm
You wanna get shot, karate chopped or stabbed this song
Motherfucker

[Hook]
Nigga the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth

[Verse 3: Beanie Mac]
Black Friday management, and Roc's the label
And I still hit you niggas with shots that's fatal
That bullshit vest can't save you
I had a doc open you up from chest to navel
See my face on cable, and have flashbacks of that cold ass table
And them hoes I gave you
I'm that nigga that'll come and pour salt in your wound
At the hospital, while the cops guardin your room
You gotta see what I've seen, look where I've looked
Touch what I've reached, and take what I've took
You gotta go where I've gone, walked where I've walked
To get where I'm at to speak what I've talked
You gotta lay where I've laid, stay where I've stayed
Play where I've played to make what I've made
You gotta move what I've moved, use what I used
Use tools how I use, use fools how I use

[Hook]
Nigga the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth

[Eve]
Some people blonde peeps red benji something moving quickly
Out of town, how they gonna find her moving swiftly
5 steps ahead of the best, well that's nothing
20 steps ahead of the rest they left something
And I base not, want not, can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title 'hard'
Me, pick of the litter I was born to bubble y'all
Born to chain game, shit born to stand guard
Play games, you left nameless, fame ball
Promise that it's never painless, nigga be hard
Come and hope you can take the heat nigga, let's start
Strong as a stallion, babe you got a dog
And she feminine with pretty women friends, all dimes
Timberlands is how I like my men in all mines
Ruff Ryde, you nigga hard head soft spine
Pass the word, must have stacks to cross lines

[Chorus]
Don't want your dough, I don't want your car
Don't want your jewels, no not at all
With them other broads you might rule it all
Not with me, sorry boo I got it all

Don't want your dough, I don't want your car
Don't want your jewels, no not at all
With them other broads you might rule it all
Not with me, sorry boo I got it all

[Jadakiss]
A chick is a chick a nut is a nut
And they always keep an attitude until you butter them up
Since I ain't gotta buy you stuff
Who's gonna hold you down if they try to run in here and tie you up
Now don't start flippin it, everybody know
We been had dough, ya just started gettin it
Money might make you grown
But you still need a dog to take you home and make you moan
You ain't gotta see the bank for loans
All I do is party and bullshit like when Frank was home
And you got it all boo, I got it all too
A four, five, and a six, and they all blue
And I don't care what she thinks
If I offer you any ice love it'll be in a drink
And instead of talking about what you got and all that
Just make sure when I hit you, you call back

[Chorus]
Don't want your dough, I don't want your car
Don't want your jewels, no not at all
With them other broads you might rule it all
Not with me, sorry boo I got it all

Don't want your dough, I don't want your car
Don't want your jewels, no not at all
With them other broads you might rule it all
Not with me, sorry boo I got it all

[Eve]
One touch will make a nigga blush on site
Grown men create a crush, nails they bite
It's a game, try to catch me, but only if you can
Takes a lot to impress the bombshell, don't want a man
And it ain't about the dough baby, Eve alright
Cause if Eve want to fly away, Eve take a flight
Eve hungry for a meal, baby Eve get a bite
Be nice and you might get to see your daddy's life

[Jadakiss]
Ma, I'm glad that you got it all, more for me
And I don't gotta pay for the puss I score for free
And the same thing I pulled on them I pulled on you
C'mon now, how you think I pulled your crew
Got my own crib so you can't kick me out
I call one of your friends to come twist me out
If you know Jada- then you know what -Kiss be about
Just for fun I hit the bank and pull fifty out

[Chorus]
Don't want your dough, I don't want your car
Don't want your jewels, no not at all
With them other broads you might rule it all
Not with me, sorry boo I got it all

Don't want your dough, I don't want your car
Don't want your jewels, no not at all
With them other broads you might rule it all
Not with me, sorry boo I got it all

Don't want your dough, I don't want your car
Don't want your jewels, no not at all
With them other broads you might rule it all
Not with me, sorry boo I got it all

38,Gravel Pit,The W,Wu-Tang Clan,2000-11-20,291266,39,"

[Intro: RZA]
1,2, 1,2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground, I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga

[Hook: Paulissa Moorman]
Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it

[Verse 1: Method Man (U-God)]
Ha, holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse
(I'm the kid with the golden arms)
And I'm the motherfuckin Hot Nicks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin
Hey, kid, walk straight, master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough
Remember what Ol' Dirty said: ""I'll fuck yo' ass up!""
Now listen

[Method Man over hook]
Back, back and forth and forth

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
E with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks, rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout

[Verse 4: U-God]
Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, grab the Tecs and loot this
Executing, shaking all sets, and I'm breaking all hecks
I'm taking all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits
On the go, check the flow, saying Wu don't rock shit
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit

[Hook 2: Paulissa Moorman]
Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb
Oh Lord ! Don't take away my stumbling blocks to lead me around

[Outro speech]
Yakub, maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now. Your presence here effects the mind of my people like a fever. You, Yakub, are the bearer of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine diseases, evil, corrupt, porkchop-eatin' brain!

Yeah check it out (Get out of here)
Such a remarkable sound
Busta Rhymes (Get out)
Comin' through, get down (Get out)
What's the deal now (Get out of here)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Are you ready to get on? (Who, me?)
And cause such a reaction that the mothafuckas go (Ooh wee)
It's like a group of happy children
Yo, it's such a feelin'
To see all of my live nigga's carry on now
Oh see how I be gettin' so passionate
I get a thrill even when I bust my gun off by accident
The God bless glory, success story
Whiteboy Billy put a stash up in my armrest for me
The way I fucks it up, it's like a fuck-fest for me
I get on last and demolish everything before me
We run shit and that's a fact now, you're whack now
And ain't no fuckin' turnin' back now, so relentless
I won't even let you niggas finish a fuckin' sentence
Call for my niggas like a school attendance
And then I strike with a fuckin' vengeance
Finger on my trigger
Figure I'll blast every last one of you bitch niggas

[Chorus]
So (Get out)
Bitch nigga just (Get out)
You need to just (Get out of here)

[Verse 2]
The one world alliance
Flipmode the most reliant for the thorough guidance
On how to get most of this money like a secret science
Only the live nigga's allowed, there's nothin' you can do
Frontin' with your crew while you talkin' to corny bitches too
Nevertheless, address the cheddar for the treasure chest
And bless the spot before the thugs protest, one time
I hope y'all know just what the motherfuck you dealin' with
With so much platinum for the street, you thought I was a silversmith
We phat now, so look at how we brought it back now
And made it possible for street niggas to hold a stack now
And become the wealthiest, healthiest
And bring the fire that will reach about 1000 degrees celsius
Hold on, banker's money better roll on, or sing a broke folk song
My nigga's so long he paid with a big brim hat, just like a lampshade
And bounce, wildin' in the truck, the joints my nigga Ramp made
We be them new millennium prime time niggas
Walk a fine line, niggas sippin fine wine niggas
Now, if you cross the line and fuck around them blind niggas
With so much pressure it's like we did the illest crime, nigga
What? You know I'm like a loco man, noble man
Turned global man, rippin' bi-coastal like a postal man
And when we come, you know we came to get it
And what you need to do is bounce if you ain't fuckin' with it

[Chorus]
So (Get out)
Bitch nigga just (Get out)
You need to just (Get out of here)
Police'll try to close the club (Get out)
You really should (Get out)
You need to just (Get out of here)
Bitch, if you ain't got your own dough (Get out)
You need to just (Get out)
You really should (Get out of here)
If you frontin' like you really live (Get out)
And you know you not (Get out)
You need to just (Get out of here)

Get out, get out, get out of here
Get out, get out, get out of here

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
What's the problem shorty?

[Shorty]
Yeah whattup man
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me

[Beanie Sigel]
Alright; hold on - Hova, line one

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, ""Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggas don't know a brick from a bite
They keep buying hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life""
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

[Shorty]
Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'mma roll with that one

[Jay-Z]
Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
Jigga Man, holla {*click*, *dial tone*}

[Beans] 1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy

[Chris] I know you well connected dog
Let me holla at somebody real
[Beans] Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on
Bleek, line two

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You new in town, no red and blue in town, that's gangs
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggas who gettin it - DEAD IT
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it
Get in, get out - that's a O.G.'s classic
900-Hustler, you pass it around
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out

{*click*, *classical type music plays*}
[MDKHN] I know this nigga ain't just put... put me on hold, man! This bullshit-ass elevator music, man
[Beans] Free, pick up line five

[Verse 3: Freeway]
First things first, watch what you say out your mouth
When you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers
Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch
When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out
If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state
Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (ho!)
Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)
You stoppin dough when we clutching the gas
I know you heard ""Friend or Foe,"" this ain't different from that
Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like
Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo
Until you up stay away from them dice and whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Cause boys want three bundles two streaks and pipe for sure
And if it's tight, then he might come back for more
Nine and four, everyday back and forth
Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler
Pass the number til you're stackin balls
Tell you how to weigh shit wet and package more
I take cash or write the check out to F-R

[Intro]
Oh, y'all niggas killers now—oh, word?
Catch you coming out your fucking crib, nigga
Yeah, catch a fucking bullet, nigga

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills
Peel on Ducatis and other four-wheels
Write a book full of medicine and generate mils
Tour the album, only for more sales
We used to catch those on the block with crills
Now, it's paid shows, promoters post up bills
Sign deals only if the math is real
If we can't match numbers, then you can't have the Head Nigga In Charge and shit
Live-nigga-rhymes artist
Pardon, P-dub shines regardless
Remorseless, haunt niggas like poltergeist
My advice, 'fore you get like that, is think twice
Before you move on it, put jewels on it, who want it?
Loose niggas make the news when we start forming
Snatch stripes off a nigga's uniform often
Don't embarrass yo' delf, you way out your jurisdiction
While niggas bullshit on the grill
I don't fuck around, dunny—it's most real
I keep it thoro, nigga

[Break]
Yo, let me back up for 'em, lemme back up, yo, yo

[Verse 2]
While niggas bullshit on the grill
I don't fuck around, dunny—it's most real
I gave birth to your whole style and feel
How do it feel to hold my dick in public?
Cockblower, duplicate rap cloner
It's me and you do it live on stage for dolo
I smack niggas like you, smash niggas by the tools
Grab niggas by the throat, show and prove
Rhymes cocky, crazy ill, mad rowdy
Did a buck off of my shit and wrapped your Audi
Temperamental, I snap quick, very touchy
Ayo, my attitude is all fucked up and real shitty
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
You feel different, nigga, see me
I throw a TV at you crazy, bitches say, ""P, you crazy""
A pain in the ass—nah, but fuck you, pay me
I'm no shorty, nigga, I stop your glory
I'm a thorough street nigga for real, you just applaud me
Avoid P, man, take your baby mom's advice
I'm nothing sweet, ill with the guns, you pay the price
When you see me in the streets soldier, salute me
You just a groupie, oh, you gangsta, then shoot me
Who gives a fuck really, I miss my nigga Twin
Kill me so I can join the rest of my force up in the heavens
You rap niggas make me laugh, y'all crazy ass
And I don't give a fuck what you sold, that shit is trash
Bang this, 'cause I guarantee that you bought it
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
I keep it thoro, nigga

[Verse 1: Lil' Bow Wow]
Hair nappy but I'm happy, pocket full of dough
From the C-O, representin' So So
The girls recognize and these niggas do too
I'm the flyest thing walkin' through junior high school
So make room next to your little Backstreet poster
'Cause Bow Wow's here and it's over! Ya heard?
I'm this, I'm that, I'm all of the above
In a big body shotgun, ridin on dub's
I've been seen with the baddest, heard with the best
And I got it locked down from the East to the West
Look at my eyes, ya know; I ain't playin'
That's why all through the streets
All I hear niggas sayin' is

[Chorus: Lil' Bow Wow]
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
And all my girls around the world that love
How it's going down, say
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
And all the girls around the world that love
How it's going down

[Verse 2: Lil' Bow Wow]
Now that the gate's wide open, it is I who they runnin' from
Little with the ill crossover like Iverson
In 2K, my way, I'm the first to rock
First to drop, ice in the bezel of a G-Shock
Like B.I.G. and Pac, I'm hard to forget
What makes it even worse, I'm just getting started
Yeah, that's me that's got your daughter in a frenzy
Yeah, that's me that's got her arguing with her friends about
Who gon' get me when they see me
Sayin', ""Do you see him?"", ""Ooh, he the man!""
Thirteen, game locked, don't trip
All that and a bag of chips; ""Hi! My name is..""

[Chorus: Lil' Bow Wow]
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
And all my girls around the world that love
How it's going down, say
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
And all the girls around the world that love
How it's going down

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg & Jermaine Dupri]
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Woof, motherfucker, the Dogg came to play
Calgon, Calgon, take me away
I'm in the dirty-dirty with my nephew J
Dizzy, izzy, boy, we getting busy
With Lil' Bow Wizzy, this shit is off the heezy
I threw him like a Frisbee and yeah, he came back
Like a boomerang, Dogg Pound gang
Hundred-thousand dollar chains, what you say, JD?
Bling, bling, money ain't a thang
Ya ask me again and I'ma tell you the same
I'm flippin' on these niggas while I'm trippin' on these niggas
Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck four
You standin' on the wall, nigga, bust a ho (Bus)
But you can't trust a ho, it's good game
Now all my niggas represent your thang
Put it up, now click-clack it up
And all the niggas, bag it up
'Cause I wanna smack it up
We do it to ya Doggystyle (Doggystyle)
Big Bow Wow in yo' mouth, bow wow!

[Chorus: Lil' Bow Wow]
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
And all my girls around the world that love
How it's going down, say
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Where my dogs at? Bark with me now
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
And all the girls around the world that love

[Intro]
Momma
I know you said that you wanted a record you could listen to
With no cussing and shit
I tried
But I still gotta do this

[Verse 1]
Yo
Jingle jingle
We've got the lingo
With so much heat, it's hard for us to pick the first single
It don't matter cuz I'm underground anyway
Rich balling, bitch call and fly any day
You dirty niggas y'all too whack to dance
Y'all need to ease up off that now before y'all splint y'all pants
And leave that up to my niggas, young fly niggas
Getting down, do or die niggas, don't try niggas
I changed my mind I don't, want your bitch
Cause sorry ass women just, don't get rich
You could keep her
I'd rather have a fifi bag because it's cheaper
You can't come up for air now
I gets deeper
And my hold is so cold, it's a sleeper
So pass the reefer
And to you false balling niggas just grab your crotches
But if you paid nigga pat your pockets

[Hook]
And for sure
You've got yours
I've got mine's and we're balling
So call up everybody
Let's pitch in ona party for sure

[Verse 2]
Alright
Somebody bring the potato salad
Let's take a ballot
On who gonna invite the hoes that make the party valid
Cuz we don't need a whole crib full of dudes again
And here come the police with them big black boots again
Kicking niggas out
Hand cuffing and stuffing a gang of Jackie's chicken in they mouth
Anton & Sean pitching a fit
Cuz somebody rolled her bud in a henny blunt and won't pass the shit
Who keeps turning the lights on?
Why the music keep skipping?
And why these dirty khaki niggas tripping?
I don't know I'm Quik and I'm still delighted
500 dollars worth of white star
About to hide it
Cuz y'all ain't drinking mine up
You better drink that E&J and Paul Masson and the rest of that wine up
You party haters need to stop it
I think we really about to pat your pockets

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey baby
My girlfriend left me today
So which one of you old raggedy ass bitches wanna come in here and play?
That's what my homie told and try to cop the cancun
Then I caught him in there hunching in my downstairs bathroom
And in the kitchen and up in there on the dancefloor
By the big screen t.v. where your pants go?
Some of you niggas I swear
I try to throw y'all raggedy asses' a party
And y'all don't even care
Cigarette burns in my plush
Empty beer bottles in the brush
And my bitch acting like a lush
Boy what else could go wrong?
Somebody kick the extension cord out
[Music stops, DJ Quik talking]
Move!
Y'all gotta be some of the clumsiest muthafuckas
[Music starts up again]
To the sounds, now it's on
Y'all done fucked up
Get out, get on
Speed up nigga
Get up, take your weed on
Yea nigga, the drunk nigga said it
Your pockets, that's where I'm heading
Kick up

Who them girls you be with when you be ridin' through?
Man, I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues, breakin' the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin' a cruise
Tell me who's your weed man, and how do you smoke so good?
You's a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag? What you got in that bag?
A couple of cans of whoop ass, you did a good-ass job of just eyein' me, spyin' me

You must have eyes on your back 'cause you got money to the ceilin'
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin', the better I'm feelin', the more that I'm chillin', winnin', drillin' and killin' the feelin'
Now, who's that bucked naked cook fixin' three course meals?
Gettin' goosebumps when her body taps the six inch heels
What in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?
A couple of gats, a couple of knives, a couple of raps, a couple of wives, now it's time to choose

Now, tell me who's your housekeeper, and what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place at a similar pace, so shake, shake it

[Intro: Teflon & Eve]
It's about that time, y'all
Ruff Ryders, you know
Teflon, Eve, woo
Yo, yo, yo
They wanna know

[Chorus]
Who's that girl? (Uh, yo, yo, c'mon, c'mon)

Who's that girl? (Uh, what's my name, yo? Yo, uh, what's my name, yo?)
Eve's that girl (Uh, uh, c'mon, c'mon, yo, yo)

[Verse 1]
Can I turn you on by my word spell?
Look into my eyes, think I want you, can't tell
Me, I keep it sexy, daddy, so I can't fail
Keep it gangster for the cowards, so I give 'em hell
Call me misfit, lips spit a gang of trash
Wrist glist' now 'cause I made a gang of cash
Light glam, still street with the durag
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that? Huh
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed, game don't run me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty, so be it, I'm supposed to change?
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't fuckin' with my mental
Natural born hustlin' bitch, check what I been through
Got mine, took it from you, and now you slot mine
Exec to my own shit, dawg, I'm ownin' dot-coms

Who's that girl? (C'mon, c'mon)
Eve's that girl (Uh, yo, yo, yo)
Who's that girl? (Huh? Uh, uh)
Eve's that girl (Yo, yo)

[Verse 2]
I can understand why they're scared of Eve
Thought I did it one way, ain't prepared for me, huh
Mad 'cause an image I don't care to be
Realness, real shit, spit reality
Attitude rude, that's the Philly in I
Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life, breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on they wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listenin' to other shit? You got the best here
Come on, try your luck, shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin', vouch for my behavior
Same way they get down, I get down for this paper
Sixteen mean from my pen, so you can test her
Still need to know who I am, then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line, my world, my way, any questions?

[Chorus]
Who's that girl? (Uh, c'mon, c'mon)
Eve's that girl (Uh, yo, yo, yo)
Who's that girl? (Uh, say my name, y'all)
Eve's that girl (Yo)

[Verse 3]
Power moves is made every day by this thorough bitch
I'ma get this bank any way that I do this shit
I was born to shine, and most of y'all's borderline bullshit
Know exactly what I want for me, you cats is clueless, though
'Spose the flow through my hands like water
Keep stocks growin' for my son or my daughter
Eve want her own cash, fuck what you bought her
He spend, you owe, that's what mommy taught her
So hardball is played, won't starve today
Song after song I write, so I get paid
Thought I wasn't followin' up with the second round
Now, bitch, swallow it up while I shove it down
Make 'em love me over again and over your name
Bet you they get over your style and over your fame
Why you lookin' sad at me? I ain't to blame
Back to plan B, baby, I can feel your pain

[Chorus]
Who's that girl? (E-V-E, y'all, uh, uh, now say my name, y'all)
Eve's that girl (C'mon, uh, uh, uh, c'mon, c'mon)
Who's that girl? (Uh, E-V-E, y'all, c'mon, now say my name, y'all)
Eve's that girl (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Who's that girl? (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Eve's that girl (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Who's that girl? (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

52,Letter 2 My Unborn,Until The End Of Time,2Pac,2001-01-01,235333,56,"

[Intro]
To my unborn child…
To my unborn child
In case I don’t make it
Just remember, Daddy loves you

[Verse 1]
Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile
In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
Tryna earn every penny that I'm gettin'
I'm reminiscin' to the beginnin' of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My mama was a Panther, loud single parent, but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house
‘Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin', so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin' revenge for the agony they did to me
See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure gettin' better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child

[Hook: Natasha Walker]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‘Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

[Verse 2]
Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty for bein' anxious
Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
It's hard to face this cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin'
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate?
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?
Dear Mama, I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child

[Hook: Natasha Walker]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‘Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

[Verse 3]
Dear Lord, can you hear me?
Tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love?
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?
‘Cause bein' black hurts, and even worse if you speak first
Livin' my life as an Outlaw – what could be worse?
‘Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who'm I kiddin'? I'm a thug 'til I die; I'm a rider, mane
Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein' there
Just know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World
Bless the boys and all my little girls
To the Lord: I'm eternal, restin' in peace
Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child

[Outro]
Please take care of all my kids and my unborn child
To my unborn child…
This letter goes out to my seeds
That I might not get to see ‘cause of this lifestyle
Just know your daddy loved you
Got nothin' but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had
‘Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age, you’ll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I’ll see you if there’s a ghetto in Heaven
If there’s a Ghetto Heaven, I’ll be there waitin' for you
Heh heh, take care, run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know sometimes there’s confusion
Rules of the game is gonna get you through it all day every day
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Friends come a dime-a-dozen
Be an individual, work hard
Study, get your mind sharp, trust nobody

You don't wanna bang with me

Yo, if they want it, cowards get it
They still wonder how I did it
Now y'all with it, these niggas see how I spit it
Huh, these bitches see how I kit it
You can hear my coupe a block away
Bitches be yellin, ""Let Me Ride"" like they Snoop and Dr. Dre
I keep spittin, them clips copped on those calicos
Keep shittin, with ziplocks of that cali dro'
Keep hittin, and shift blocks for that cali dough
Keep gettin, my tip rocked by them cali hoes
It's William Bonnie, stealin' mamis
Dance closely, even though they feel the llamies
I ain't tryin' to send police to ya res'
I'm tryin' to put this piece to ya chest
And you in peace wit the rest
You can release to the press - this how G's ride
From the North to the South to the East to the West, let's go

[Fabolous] + (Nate Dogg)
Yo ma, I got you stuck off the realness

In them trucks wit the wheels glissed
In V.I.P, with buckets of chilled Cris'
'Click, click', who the fuck wanna feel this?
I still got them blocks movin, and the system in my truck
That can make it feel like the block's movin'
My 6-4's, wit the wheels and the shocks movin'
Them boys in blue with the shields and the Glocks movin'
(You can't deny it) I'm the same ol' G
The Guc' frames got the same gold G
Duke can you frame O-3, 'cause if you see me on ya corner wit a 40
It ain't gonna be named Olde E
I might be in Chuck T's, or the Chukka's
And if your duck cheese I'mma fuck her, duck these motherfucker
Ghetto Fabolous, nigga I ride 'til I die
Hollerin' 1-8-7 when I ride through the Stuy, fool

[Nate Dogg]
It ain't really dat hard, to get fucked up
Its really quite easy, just step up
I'mma knock him so hard, on his butt
Just like he been drinkin', like he drunk
The fat bitch stood up, just stood up
She bout to be singin', turn it up
You won't hear a thang, know you won't
You too busy sleepin', won't wake up
You can't deny it

[Fabolous]
The kid pull the four out a little quicker
You might end up the reason, ya homies
Will have to pour out a little liquor
Every stack that a draws out a little thicker
I get brain, kick the whores out a little quicker
You kids rap; that's cool
But the kid's wrapped in jewels, the kid clapped that tool
Kidnap that fool, you don't wanna wake up gettin told
That ya kids trapped at school
When the time's right, I'mma put this nine right
To the left side of ya head, push ya mind right
It's still nuthin' but a G thang, I thought you knew
And I'm bout to do the numbers that they thought you do
Still don't know me, still jump in a Lex
The chain so icy, I got chill bumps on my neck
The NARCS heard, how the krills pump in the 'jects
Still bump in your decks, still dumpin' the TEC, still

Frustration, baby, you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me

Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, 16's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes

I knew I had to give you more, it's only been a year

Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Glocked down, blasters, sets while I mash out
Yeah, nigga, mash out, D-R-E, huh
Backtrack, make that, E-V-E
Do you like that? (Ew) You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe, I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, tension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn, she much thinner know now I'm complete (Uh-huh)

No one scared of getting dirty 'cause we came from the mud
And we hungrier than ever, he rise, she rise
We rise together, birds of a flock
More like birds of a feather

When we giving up? Never
Scratch it off your wishlist, mark it on your calendar
A-town players never play wit' no amateurs
Eighty thou' strong and the fans all screaming

It's been heavy on my mind since '99
See, I've been putting it down here since '83
Since William Andrews and Bartkowski
When Fulton County stadium was the place to be
If you rep the A-town, then you feel just like me
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballin-ist Player
Make my own rules and call me the mayor
Tail-gating in the parking lot, it's like the club
The energy, the brotherhood, everybody rise up
Together, we rise on the rest

Around the city, all sides

Rockin the fur coat bringin the blue fox out
Diamonds light up the block, runnin the blue rocks out
Whylin till all of my crew knocks out
Get yo' ass up on the floor
Huh, throw ya hands if you wan't some more
Baby, wiggle your crotch out, huh
And peep the way we be blowin them spots out

Bring your crew, 'cause we don't care

[Verse 1]
One more time
I gots to hit the streets off
Make the streets talk, let 'em know it ain't a sweet walk
This gon' be
The only joint made this year that'll knock 'til 2003
And y'all gon' see
That the hottest nigga out there was, is, and will be me
Just like that
I can go away for a minute
Do some other shit, but bounce right back
And when it's on, I'm coming strapped
With some shit that'll spit from dusk 'til dawn
And when you gone
Ain't no coming back in the morn'
Like that shit was a dream, nigga, you gone
That's for real
Creep niggas like a SEAL
Tote the steel, stick a nigga, make him squeal
Oh, my God
Those can't be the last words of your man
Damn, your man was so hard (Come on)

Straight up, niggas is dyin'
Yo, what the fuck is you cats doing?
Running around like this, like you won't get stuck?
Yo, that's my word

[Verse 3]
Bring the noise
And you better come with niggas you don't give a fuck about
'Cause you gon' lose your boys
'Cause we don't play
And the silencer will silence any cocksucker with somethin' to say
Dog for life
Whether I'm on or off the leash, I bite, streets are my life
Click, click, boom
Another life taken too soon, another mother had a funeral
Still waters run deep
And the pain is forever alive inside, makes it hard to sleep
But I keep goin', goin'
Shit, I'm always careful when I walk, I'm always seein', knowin'
The dog gon' live
Stay walkin' the wire, over the fire, when I can, I give
The dog is good
And how it's stayin'
Dog gon' fuck with the hood 'til dog fuck with the wood

Bring it, what?

Yeah, Bad Boy motherfucker

[Puff Daddy]
That's that shit right here, whom shall I fear
Throw your guns in the air
Socialize, get down, let your soouull lead the way
Cause i'm that enemy that you can't see
But you wanna be you ain't shit to me
Playa, It ain't hard for you to get to me
Playa, my real dogs they'll spit for me
So if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart
I've seen em come and I've seen em part
You ain't want beef then why did you start?
Front from the light catch shots after dark
Suffer, duck or you'll catch these
On the spot, red dots make em all believe
Ain't nobody kicking the rhymes like these
See I do the things that they can't achieve
So don't start bassin' I'll start placing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
More hotter than the sun
I'm living on the run
Because i'm public enemy number one

Chorus:
One, One, One,One (Make it hot, daddy, make it hot)
One, One, One (Make it hot, daddy, make it hot)
One, One, One (Make it hot, daddy, make it hot) (Bad Boy Motherfucker)

[Puff Daddy]
Let me ask you, what you got against me?
Is it my girl or is it the Bentley?
Is it my house or maybe its all three
I just came up and you're all against me
But ask yourself, why is he number one?
Now ask yourself, who's done what he's done?
Then ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?
You think its a game you shittin the wrong one
Always with God and I don't swing solo
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo
Wanna see me out, but I just won't go though
Pretty young things wanna have my photo
One in the room hangin' on the wall
In rememberance that I rocked 'em all
Got no time for those that think small
Grill me in the club cause they can't ball
Hate shot callers
Hate them ballers
Back in control now I call orders
It's no fun fleeing under the gun
Cause they got me public enemy number one

Chorus:
One, One, One,One (Make it hot, daddy, make it hot)
One, One, One (Make it hot, daddy, make it hot)
One, One, One (Make it hot, daddy, make it hot) (Bad Boy Motherfucker)

[Puff Daddy]
Suckers, liars, court testifiers
Wanna infiltrate and break my empire
I spit lines, hit rhymes
Keep dimes sweating
Giving them the juice that they're not gettin'
A bona fide playa, now who got the flavor
A non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the life saver, the New York mayor
Before you try me, you better say your prayers
My word to the wise is: ""Do not try""
Do you know that i'm gone then say don't die
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme
Thought it was over but I crept from behind
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind
Almost 2000 and running out of time
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines
A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine
Soldiers in position all on the front line
Don't make a move till I give them the sign
Known as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son
I'm public enemy number one

Chorus:
One, One, One,One (Make it hot, daddy, make it hot)
One, One, One (Make it hot, daddy, make it hot)
One, One, One (Make it hot, daddy, make it hot) (Bad Boy Motherfuckers) x 4

Make it hot, daddy, make it hot
Make it hot, daddy, make it hot
Make it hot, daddy, make it hot
Make it hot, daddy, make it hot

Uhh.. uh-oh, uh-oh
Tch-tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka uhh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Tchka-tchka uhh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Say what, say what? Freaky freaky uhh
Tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka Bubba

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Shit I ain't choose to rhyme; rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin' - like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now, but it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer? That sucks for you
'Cause this is Bubba's moment - I put my mother on it
I said my momma; it seems as if I love her don't it?
So buckle up, cause it's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's, and my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk - gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside
This is complicated - at least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits
But until that day, y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw you crank it cause I just leap through you
What you need to do, is just admit you love me
The South has always been Dirty but now it's gettin' ugly

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Though I am country, don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger, with every song I hear
'Cause y'all been bullshittin', spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and came with somethin' that truly matters
On goes the saga - of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrow, if I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now; I hate it came to this
How else can I say it I don't speak no other languages
I'm fairly ripped now, so this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha? That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem' bows - fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just forget what we discussin'
This that new South - take a picture of me
'Cause I'm a fuckin' legend, and this is gettin' ugly

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Now this thang is jumpin' - ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special, this whole moment came from nothin'
Now you see it triples; I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets hatin' broads clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live, you with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin', then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law - they can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions; I wanna see you wylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight - know he was smilin'

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly, ugly, ugly
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get ugly - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

[Outro: Timbaland & Missy Elliott]
Ha ha, it's gon' get (ugly - in here!)
Thck-thck (Huh, in here! Huh, in here!)
It's gon' get (ugly - in here!)
(Huh, in here! Huh, in here!)
It's gon' get (ugly) say what?

I'm the most critically acclaimed rap bitch in the game
Coast-to-coast, stash the gat in holster girl
Dark-skinned Christian Dior poster girl
I'm a rockin' Timbs bitch and a Gucci loafer girl
Niggas say I'm too pretty to spit rhymes this gritty
Fuck y'all thought? Be dancin' around in suits like I'm *****?
Pretty, show niggas how we run this city
Respect my name, Boogie, nigga, stay in ya lane
Like The Hurricane, rains on bitches like Sugar Shane
And dare one of y'all rap bitches to mention Fox name
What's beef? Beef is when bitches think it's sweet

Sometimes I feel like I'm just too fuckin' real
I love to stack riches, no disrespect, y'all
I respect the rap game, but I don't fuck with rap bitches
I'm speakin' from my heart
It's not that I'm too good, I'm just hood
Been like this from the fuckin' start
Since I bust my gun in ninety-six
Y'all ain't never see me flick up with them fake-ass chicks
Bitches smile up in your face, turn around and pop shit
You a industry bitch, I'm a in the streets bitch
I might breeze through Prada, Chloe or Tiffs
But, other than that it's just me and my six

My moms and pops mixed it with the Trini' rum and whiskey
Uh, proper set off
Six sped off, gats let off, I speak calm
Gangsta and pose off like Screechie Dan, bwoy
Who y'all know rock Prada like Fox?
Pop bottles in the back of the cellar with Donatella?
Cartier wrist wear, Pasha cage face
Y'all niggas stand in line just to get a sneak taste
Act like y'all don't know I keeps gat beneath waist
And like a hundred thou', each crib in each safe
When Fox come through she ah go dun di place
I'm like Marion Jones, what? Who the fluck wan' race?
Listen, never trippin', never catch Brown slippin'
Fuck, y'all only nice around mics like Pippen
Shit, to all my thugs that's Bloodin' or Crippin'

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

[Verse 1]
Denzel said it first
Never seen a moving truck followed by a hearse
Never seen heaven, only hell on this Earth
My pain is so deep, on swell finna burst
I hit the block, ready to rock on anger
Override danger
Deal with devils, saw angels
I’m on edge, whole hood is incarcerated
Cataloged by the loss so I’m staying faded
Unbearable, being in the physical
I need a miracle, ain’t even spiritual
Looting and violence, they say that I’m violent
I’m on survival mode, I’m so defiant
My health dwindling, got chronic stress
High blood pressure, accelerated death
Accelerated aging, accelerated debt
All of my people fading, ain’t nobody left

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna suffer, I wanna prosper
I want mine now, I want options
I wanna live long (but I doubt it)
I wanna live long (yeah I doubt it)
I don’t want sorrow, I wanna thrive
I want mine now, on the rhyme
I wanna live long (but I doubt it)
I wanna live long

[Verse 2]
In the hood, it’s like a melting pot
Not caring if hell is hot
You can get wet up under umbrellas from a felon shot
I don’t see the man with every dream taking lessons from a fiend
And the business ran by greed
Where employees probably bleed when they cracking out
Listen and see if you point the problem out
Being there is walking, smiling, buying whole islands now
Brothers I grew up with, hearts stopping, they dying now
I ain’t gonna sit and deny, I’m watching my diet now
I’m pissed they let police pull a pistol, pop us, then buy em out
But sip expensive name brand liquors and spending large amounts
I ain’t had no trust funds
Our parents don’t even trust us
From stealing out they purses and wallets before the bus come
Whites call us thugs
We live and thuggin’ for fun now
Learn to be so high
We feel depressed when we come down
Where we made it from where we used to be is like from the wake to the eulogy
This feeling I deal with is nothing new to me

[Bridge]
I don’t wanna suffer, I wanna prosper
I want mine now, I want options
I wanna live long (but I doubt it)
I wanna live long (yeah I doubt it)
I don’t want sorrow, I wanna thrive
I want mine now, on the rhyme
I wanna live long (but I doubt it)
I wanna live long (yeah I doubt it)

66,X,Restless,Xzibit,2000-04-02,255640,60,"

[Intro: Xzibit]
Yeah! Ladies and gentleman
Broadcastin' live to you and yours
It's Mr. X to the Z, Xzibit
Yeah, bouncin', c'mon

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
The first day of the rest of my life
X stand behind the mic like Walter Cronkite
Y'all keep the spotlight, I'm keepin' my rhymes tight
Lose sight of what you believe and call it a night
This ain't the light-weight, cake mix shit that you're used to
Teflon territory you just can't shoot through
You gon' shoot who? (Who?) Not even on your best day
Rollin' the Wild West way, givin' it up
Leavin' the whole world stuck not givin' a fuck
Laid in the cut, now we break through in the rut
Hennesey and orange juice baby fill up a cup
Quick to grab Mary Jane by the butt and squeeze
Loosen up, let your hair down and join the festivities
Overcrowd the house like lockdown facilities
Bitches be quick to give me brains while the pistol range
Goin' up and down my dick like the stock exchange

[Chorus: Xzibit & (Dr. Dre)]
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Ever since Xzibit could spit, been on some pimp shit
Approach every woman like a potential mistress
Shine bright, make sure that X stay tight
Cause tonight I might meet my next ex-wife
Mr. Big Chief Reefer, Xzibit use his dick like a Visa
I run it through and money come out
Runnin' your mouth, I'll have somebody run in your house
Borrow your spouse and have a little fun on the couch
Now you know that it was bound to happen
I came to give you what you lackin'
Whenever you hear them other niggas rappin'
Rockin' chains, stadiums, paladiums, cracked craniums
My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium
Drop-top tinted on twenties
Usin' rappers like crash test dummies, stackin' real estate and money
It's funny how things change overnight when you thinkin' right
I beat the odds like Ike beat on his first wife

[Chorus: Xzibit & (Dr. Dre)]
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
What an event, we hardcore a hundred percent
Makin' it stick, Los Angeles proudly presents
The real deal, how does it feel? No special effects
Yank the chain off of your neck, demand the respect
Now all your conversations sound strange to me
Seem like everybody around me done changed but me
I stand alone on my own two feet
Stab a track, strangle the beat - Restless, no time for sleep
Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grimm
It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend
Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)
Call Doc, bounce to the spot and slide right in
I ain't tryin' to see nothing but progress, regardless
Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious
Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle
Hennessy, rock plenty of ice, make it a double, and scream

[Chorus: Xzibit & (Dr. Dre)]
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family
(X) Rearrange the whole game with my rugged sound
(X) Won't even say your own name when I come around
(X) Stay on top but remain from the underground
(X) to the Z and we all in the family

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
So there you have it - A-B-C, D-P-G-C
X to the motherfuckin' Z
Mr. Xuberant, Xtravagant, Xtrordinary, Xciting, X-a-lotta
XO with a little bit of Xtacy
X-ing your bitch-ass out if you tryin' to test the G
And what's the recipe? Xcalibur weaponry
And we shoot Xceptionally
That there is hot - X marks the spot?
Fuck naw, X spots the marks
Xclamation point, niggas!

67,Izzo (H.O.V.A.),The Blueprint (Explicit Version),JAY-Z,2001-09-11,240626,59,"

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, let's put our hands together for this dynasty
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
To the eighth wonder of the world
The flow of the century
Always timeless
Hov
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
I appreciate that
Uh

[Verse 1]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese, I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch

[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up (Holla at me)

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let 'em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady, it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raisin' the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks

[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up

[Verse 3]
Yeah, Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack (Yeah)
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy

[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up

[Outro]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

[Verse 1: Havoc]
It be a buck-fifty, your chance of runnin' is ifitty
Slugs that leave niggas drugged like a chick slip the Mickey
I'm so on the low it'd take a Navy Seal to get me
When I surface, if not chips to Benz is the purpose
On your team I'll pull the curtain, a beautiful hurtin'
'til my eyes see the blood, that mean the creep start workin'
Niggas never learnin' that they eyes keep lurkin'
Have ya janitor pumpin' your X5 murkin'
Skid marks the street, your heart skips a beat
Beef? Nigga overcook that meat
Get no sleep, only rest is in between the blink
My life story was written in blood, permanent ink
Killer instinct, R.I.P. 'em
Gotta think like that cause forever I be needin' 'em
Plan flawless, mistakes never repeatin' 'em
Some love, some hate me, bitches in the head beatin' 'em
Niggas wanna ride by the crib all slow
We clap mothafucka, want a real rap show?
Fiends are rushin' when the mack blow, dead in my castle
And in the blink watch how quick life pass you

[Chorus: Vita]
What's wrong with mothafuckas when will they ever learn
Keep playin' with that fire and that ass is gettin' burned
Fuckin' with semi-autos, one foot is in the grave
We givin' all of y'all somethin' to be afraid of
What's wrong with mothafuckas when will they ever learn
Keep playin' with that fire and that ass is gettin' burned
Fuckin' with semi-autos, one foot is in the grave
We givin' all of y'all somethin' to be afraid of

[Verse 2: Big Noyd]
Let me tell you how it's goin' down, it's on now
Niggas used to love me, now they wanna hate me now
I'm that same nigga with the tech, holdin' the spot down
Except I'm pushin' a Lex, lettin' the top down
But wait, you don't think I live a pop life now
That's hate, you could get popped right now
Me don't play, I keep a gun around my way
And I'm a fuckin' drama king like my nigga Kay Slay
Sex, drugs, money and murder all day
It's rules, guidelines and codes, we obey
Don't even trip, IMD the set I claim
Infamous Mobb Deep nigga, ready to bang
Nigga don't think shit stink, then shit hit the fans
So I don't slip, I'mma shit with my gun in my hand
It's a thug thing y'all niggas wouldn't understand and
Y'all keep guns we keep our shit bangin'

[Chorus: Vita]
What's wrong with mothafuckas when will they ever learn
Keep playin' with that fire and that ass is gettin' burned
Fuckin' with semi-autos, one foot is in the grave
We givin' all of y'all somethin' to be afraid of

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
You a bitch-ass nigga, I'll have you killed
All they had was your picture at the funeral
No casket, you bastards be missin'
My jewels, my whip, my rims we bitchin'
My guns be the heat that'll make you blister
My mens, my Timbs'll stomp you niggas
No shit, no clip, don't fuck with us
It's no problem, I bring it to the best of them
From the old to the new and the rest of them
No love, just slugs for ya body, dunn!
Just pain, just sufferin' and worst than that
You let me get my hands on you so I'm takin' advantage
And that shit that you pulled ain't do me no damage
You don't know me, nigga, but we bout to change that shit!
Wrap that nigga up like a package
Fuck all them niggas; buck all them faggots!

[Chorus: Vita]
What's wrong with mothafuckas when will they ever learn
Keep playin' with that fire and that ass is gettin' burned
Fuckin' with semi-autos, one foot is in the grave
We givin' all of y'all somethin' to be afraid of
What's wrong with mothafuckas when will they ever learn
Keep playin' with that fire and that ass is gettin' burned
Fuckin' with semi-autos, one foot is in the grave
We givin' all of y'all somethin' to be afraid of

[Outro: Vita]
Yeah, QB (Yeah)

Laugh when you cryin', cry when you laughin
But ain't nothing happenin', a girl got a little uptight
Turned off the light and then started crashin'
The radio blastin' ""Between Me and You""
But, you ain't on the low with that freaky thing you do
Girl I thought you knew (what I do), know I know

Teen drinking is very bad
Yo I got a fake ID though
Yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, yo, 2 step with me, 2 step with me

[Verse 1]
1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to poppin we do shit for fun
You ain't got one nigga you betta run
Now I'm in the back gettin head from my hunz
While she goin down I'm breakin down what I done
She smokin my blunt sayin she ain't havin fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none

[Chorus]
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

[Verse 2]
2, here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5
Now I'm lookin at shorty right in the eyes
Couple seconds passed now I'm lookin at her thighs
While she tellin me how much she hate her guy
Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
If you 21 girl that's alright
I wonder if a shake comin with them fries
If so baby can I get em super sized
Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2
She started feelin on my johnson right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin that's cool
But instead of 1 lifestyle I need 2
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with a crew
You know how I do but I guess one gotta do

[Chorus]
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy
Everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

[Verse 3]
3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6
Self explanatory I ain't gotta say I'm rich
This single man ain't tryna get hitched
Liquor wasted on me man son of a bitch
Brushed it all off now I'm back to gettin lit
Goose and orange juice man this some good ish
Homeboy trippin cause I'm starin at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin at my clique
Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club on the set Kwon cut out them trees
Dude I don't care I'm a P.I.M.P

Now everybody in this bitch gettin tipsy

71,Let's Get Dirty (I Can't Get In Da Club),Malpractice,Redman,2001-05-22,235533,42,"

[Intro]
Attention, all you niggas, all you bitches
Time to put down the Cristal
Time to take off the ice for a minute
Time to throw a little mud in this motherfucker
Turn me up some
Yo
Oh shit, who those motherfuckers coming in here?
No, it can't be (Yo)

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo, give me some room, I'm throwing elbows
Timberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them?
If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'ma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black when I'm making the moves
Similar to the new PlayStation 2
I can't help it if the club only packin' a G
And the fire marshal wanna shut it down at three
And you ballin' ass niggas, who's dressed to kill
For the hoes showing the toes with extra heels (Man)
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a car load of bitches charged on Belvedere
My niggas hit the cells if the line is thick
So I drive the 500 through the door of the bitch

[Interlude: DJ Kool]
Yo, Red, what's up, man?
Ayy, they ain't trying to let you in the club
Yo, DJ Kool to the rescue
We gon' break this joint down
Ayo

[Chorus: DJ Kool & Redman]
If you pumping this one in your truck (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
And you really don't give a what (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody get your hands up (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
If you ain't come to party shut up (Let's get dirty, come on)
Say let's get dirty

[Verse 2:Redman]
Yo, security patting my legs and waist
But if I vacate the place, it'll be (Stay down)
All my niggas in the huddle, on the count of three
We gonna bum rush the tunnel with a pound of weed
Cut the light on, you see it's Brick City in here
Blazing like Biggie passed us a semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out
I'm outside of the line and I'm acting a fool
Like a three o'clock bully waiting after school (Punks)
I've been in this line for hours
I even killed the time by helping my man pass out fliers
Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in
Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in
Jump, move, crash, smoke, drink
Shake that ass thang, the fuck you think?
Papa Bear at the table, and the porridge is pouring
Since Def is the label I belong in a morgue
I'm walking half dead, acting senile
With bigger niggas from jail than the one on ""Green Mile""
I'll huff and puff, blow the club down
I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed uptown

[Interlude: DJ Kool]
Yeah, that's right, we up in this joint now
Ayo, we getting ready to take over
Freddie, you grab the mic, I'ma grab the turntables
We gon' rock this joint, baby

[Chorus: DJ Kool & Redman]
If you got up in the club free (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
And you drunk up in the V.I.P. (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
If you swingin' from them club nights (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
And you like to start them club fights (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
Everybody wave your hands now (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody jump up and down (Let's get dirty, come on)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody come to wild out (Let's get dirty, wild out)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
If you a big dog no doubt (Let's get dirty)
Say let's get dirty
Everybody wave your hands now (Let's get dirty, put 'em up)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody jump up and down (Let's get dirty, come on)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Everybody keep it going now (Let's get dirty, keep it going)
Say let's get dirty (Let's get dirty)
Just a little bit louder now (Let's get dirty, louder)
Say let's get dirty, come on, come on

Fabolous, Jagged Edge, don't be fool, I'd rather have you ma'
Than everything, I'd give it all, just for you, yeah
You're the one baby girl, I've never been so sure(butt sex ahh)
Your skin's so pure, the type men go for
The type I drive the Benz slow for
The type I be beepin the horn, rollin down the windows for
Never been no whore
So to get you in closed doors, I buy you everything in those stores
This, that, and those yours
As long as Fabolous the only one you let that grin show for
You ain't gotta spend no more, I'm a put a rock on your hand
You ain't gotta say ""we just friends"" no more
I shine, you shine, it never been no flaws
I ain't like most who just wanna get in those drawers
'Cause every king need a queen
And with me and you girl I ain't tryna let a thing in between
It ain't a thing, nahmean, chicks hate, show 'em the ring and the green
And let your middle finger be seen, it's on

(Chorus - Jagged Edge)
Girl I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream (my dream)
All, anything to have you on my team (I don't care baby)
All, baby girl I'd trade it all (I'd trade it, yeah)
Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring (oh yeah)
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl I'd trade it all

Uh, don't front ma', you know the way I ball's to pick and roll
Like Stockton and Malone when we play the mall
I be goin out my way to call
'Cause I love the way your hips make your jeans seem like they too small
Them see-through tops with your titties exposed
When you kick off them shoes there ain't bitty whose toes as pretty as those
That blonde hair look good, straight down, bun or the braids
And I ain't gon' talk about them light-browns under your shades
Bust right, thus tight
Got a thick set of thighs and struts like......uh
Yo' the game taught this brother to mack
But I think I slipped when I saw them full lips covered with Mac
You got everything that others would lack
Along with the F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S
Your patience I personally admire
'Cause I started out a player now I'm 'bout to have my jersey retired
For real

(Chorus)
There ain't no ""mights"" or ""maybe""
I done did wrong, so I'm a make sure it's right for my baby
You know how tight that my day be
And how long and stressin them flights to L.A. be
Ain't no rumor gon' get back to your friends
Before I let a nigga disrespect you I be back in the pen
Front to back you a ten
You got me thinkin 'bout puttin a car seat in back of the Benz, uh

Uh-huh, you know where I'm taking this
I'm taking it right there, they leave me no choice

[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
She said she was a model for a year and a half
And if she took her pins out
Then her hair would drop down to her calf
I knew her man, he was just up North
And would've got left up North, but he was the chef up North
Anyway I'm K-I-double
All I do is get dough, spit flows, try to stay out of trouble
If you ready we could move, just lose your man
Or hit the dance floor, I'll show you how to do my dance
Or I might let you play in the garden
Or sit up in that white thing and listen to the greatest of Marvin
The estate got 6 locations
Take so long to get to the front once I missed probation
And I hate to brag
I know ya man really wouldn't like the Beretta but he'd hate the Mag
And yeah here go a blank check, rock yourself out
But in the mean time girl - knock yourself out

[Hook - Pharrell]
Oh you modeling momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
What you wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancing? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)
Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out)

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
Now you can knock yourself out like you boxin yourself
Or you can get real freaky, start popping yourself
And my watch got so many rocks, when you look at the time
It's sorta like you watching yourself, uhh
Front if you want, I puff a few blunts
And take a cruise in a Porsche with the trunk in the front
She had the Jocko Broshure sandals, told her hop in
The coupe blew her mind when she couldn't find the door handles
Attitude very high maintenance; check this out ma
I'm running out of my patience
Don't sleep with me? Then don't speak with me
And never talk bad about niggas that eat with me

[Hook]
Oh you modeling momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
What you wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancing? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)
Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out)

[Verse 3]
Ayyo, honey know I'm waiting to leave
Keep dancing, cause I like how that ass shake in them capris
I'm like Big with the murder mamis up in Belize
But I'll still fuck a chickenhead like Lil' Cease
I don't care if they model, bet they all goin' chill
First nigga to cook base on a Foreman grill
And you might win some, but you just lost one
Kiss miseducates 'em like Lauryn Hill

Oh you modeling momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
What you wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancing? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)

Herky got my quarter-0 sack and blunt papers
Quick to rip and rap roll that, my life saver

Y'all be hatin a lot 'cause we makin a lot

It's V.I.P. parkin, walked in sparkin
Ain't nobody chargin, feelin like a sergeant
They all linin up, all nines and up
And I better make my choice, the nights windin enough
Long skirt, cornrows, she's fine enough
Dressed in black, black suit and my brim be black
With a Cardinal bird on it, my team gon' blow
Nigga, I put my word on it, my team shoots well
That's if I had Kerr on it, no standin in line (who, me?)
My coat got fur on it, I'm a slide right in
And I keep a room key, ain't no need for no pin
I got Sugar Daddy partyin wit' me, man, bring mo' friends

(Nelly)
Check it
It ain't my fault I was born with Country Grammar and talk, ma'
No ma', I ain't hurt, that's just my walk, ma'
Slight limp son, you know, to Simpson
I keep it burgged out, play your cards right you get some
Call me Kane when ya sayin my name, the lips numb
I'm talkin brains in the back of the Range, (been done)
I be's like only five-ten, weighin one-seven-one
But if you close your eyes, swore you're gettin crushed by a bum
Be like ""oh Nelly, can I call you Mr. Hanes?""
Whichever one just made you came, then that'll be thy name
The one they couldn't tame, I ain't speakin from the vain
I'm speakin from the change, the rapper and the chain
The high rise, overlookin ducks and thangs
I can see you're fascinated by the trucks and thangs
On Q, when she hopped on the tip my man
She must've been a vivrant thang, a vivrant thang, ay
All my niggas, if you wit' me let me know, (why?)
Who keep it hotter in the night than in the day (I)
""You boys for real"", ""you fakin"" at the same time
Gotta set the game tight 'cause some a y'all ain't playin right

Ever since that Country Grammar shit, you know, this has been the life
]Man, I don't know, I've been thinking
I don't man, like, everywhere I fucking go

If she head for the stash, I always got this pistol with me
Constantly we bustin' to a hell of a beat
Then we came - then, we, came, cause, the bass'll knock you off of your feet
Just that deep - just, that, deep, I, betcha we be movin ya feet
Voice kinda mellow, place from the ghetto
If you still want some more, go and get the fuckin CD

I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...
I got love... I got love...

78,Renegade,The Blueprint (Explicit Version),JAY-Z,2001-09-11,337760,57,"

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a

[Chorus: Eminem & JAY-Z]
Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?), anything (Anything)
Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to holler about anything
(Anything?), anything (Anything)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan, my pops left me
And often my mama wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?), I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfuckin'

[Chorus: Eminem & JAY-Z]
Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?), anything (Anything)
Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to holler about anything
(Anything?), anything (Anything)
Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
'Cause I'm a renegade
Never been afraid to talk about anything

Renegade, never been afraid to say

Makin it happen, wit snappin to avoid that - anchor
Hook me up with plenty tracks to keep a playa rappin
So put my city on the map
Hook me up wit million dollar vocal cords

Wastin time just to figure out, without a doubt, that we stackin

The way you move to the music - it make a nigga wanna
Take you up outta here, go somewhere, loose it
And your physique is off the chain
It's gonna be hard gettin you off the brain
I mean we could take a drive in the X5
The way you boogie on the floor, know that sex slide
You's a dime piece, I'm tryin to see somethin
Suck your t's and in your front and lemme squeeze somethin

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I got a few hours left 'til a nigga jet
And I'm hopin that it's you that a nigga get
Hear them callin out ya name, I geuss ya showtime
Get'cha money shorty, lemme see you pole climb
Toes out, back showin off the tat-toooo
Fuck the dumb shit, a nigga had to snatch youuuu
Lookin as good as ya smell, pay your own bills
Ask officer, cuz your pushin your own wheels
Yea I'm feelin you tryin to see the deal with you
What's goin on, later on, can I chill with you?
We can do anything that you wanna do
You know the way a nigga feel, all I want is you
Get ya dance on
Love the way you make the moves with no pants on
Let's ride!
Bounce to ya man's song
Let's get to goin, it's goin on before the chance gone
Next stop

[Hook x4]

[Mr. Cheeks]
Yo, turn with me now
Do my thing, hey swing with me now
Bink dawg now, one shot deal shit
Keep it tight, and this is how we steal shit
It's that real shit, it's that new shit
How we come thru shit

85,Until The End Of Time,Until The End Of Time,2Pac,2001-01-01,266506,56,"

[Produced By: Johnny J & Trackmasters]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

86,I'm Serious (feat. Beenie Man) - Club Mix,I'm Serious,T.I.,2001-10-01,207600,30,"

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, take a good look at me - now picture me unhappy
No cash and outta fashion, not flashin'
Picture me doin' bad even if I wouldn't rappin'
Picture me even breathe on the mic not snappin'
I'm fire hot not lukewarm, my arms frozen
Picture me in a room full of hoes unchosen
Picture me with no P.O. and no 'dro
Picture pimps walk with some broads and ain't gettin' no 'tho
L.A. gone and I ain't gotta deal no mo' (Picture that)
A Ghet-O-Vision ain't real no mo' (Picture that)
A T.I.P. ain't worth a mill' no mo'
He still so-so (picture that) he still po'
***** picture that, or matter fact, picture T.I.P
Gettin' anything other than rich
Now can you picture this, young, pompous, arrogant son of a *****
Labelled as anything less than the ****, I can't see it

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Pull up in a blue coupe that's damn near clear
And Polo gear that won't drop 'til next year
Be like this here, Cartier frames and Piaget wristwear
T.I.P. your majesty's right c'here
Notice when I came the dames disappeared, ya lames listen here
To play me, ba-by, hey he
Gone need a track from God featuring Jesus or Jay-Z
Go on floss, ball but where it cost
Smile for the cameras, take your shirts off
Y'all ****** actin, take ya skirts off
Hoppin' Bob-ass ***** and he don't wanna work, boss
I'm gettin' sick and tired of these phony renditions
Wonder why I don't consider them no competition
There's no vision - little ambition
How I feel about these ******, am I worried? Are ya kiddin'?

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Some ***** wonder what my goal is
They think it's goin' gold havin' **** sweatin' me
**** that, I'm in it for the longevity
Picture me as one of the greatest that'll ever be
Comparin' me to 2Pac, B.I.G., and Jay-Z
Work with legends like, Organized No-I-Z, and J.D
Neptunes, they even flow on one of Dre's beats
Fly to Miami, chill with Luke and we can trade freaks
I freak shows, just peep **** under shade trees
Huh, but KP say just keep it top-notch
And make sure that the club is jumpin' like it's hopscotch
Floss rocks and in the summer keep the top dropped
Ten thousand dollars worth of clothes when I go shop
In the Impala on them Vogues so the **** jock
Especially when I rock that linen suit with no socks
In Polo skippers, they undo zippers
And they shows ****, the sure shot
I'm serious

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Outro: Beenie Man]
Well it's a Neptunes sound (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Zagga-zagga-za, na-na-na-na-na (T.I.P.)
Whoa na-na-na-na (Beenie Man)
(Zagga-za-za-za, Oh we dat ****)
An a ziggi-ziggi-zagga (Bad man sittin')
Straight from Jamaica (Alright lemme give this to ya)
Alright lemme tell them somethin' (See it's goin' down)

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Je t'adore, JAY-Z
Course I love you
I love all y'all
For real

[Chorus: Biz Markie & JAY-Z]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at you when I come off tour, yeah

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
I got this Spanish chica, she don't like me to roam
So she call me cabron, plus maricon
Said she likes to cook rice, so she likes me home
I'm like, ""Un momento, mami, slow up your tempo""
I got this Black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talkin' out her neck, makin' her fingers snap
She like, ""Listen, Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me""
I got this French chick that love to French kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
Ma cherie amour, tu es belle
Merci, you're fine as fuck, but you giving me hell
I got this Indian squaw, the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather?
She said, ""All you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me, you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough""
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian, and Black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken, damn, I'm getting fat
Arroz con pollo, French fries and crêpes
An appetite for destruction, but I scrape the plate, I love

[Chorus: Q-Tip & JAY-Z]
Girls, girls, girls, girls (Uh-huh)
Girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at you when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls all over the globe
I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce-zeros
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll, come on

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I got this young chick, she so immature
She like, ""Why you don't buy me Reeboks no more?""
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough, she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the narcs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma, she's always on the scene
Goddamn, she's fine, but she parties all the time
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat-back love
So I had to introduce her to the mile high club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project, and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills, and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first-class seat, I love

[Chorus: Slick Rick & JAY-Z]
Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at you when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls all over the globe
I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce-zeros
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I got this paranoid chick, she's scared to come to the house
A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out (What you doin', daddy?)
Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that gets shit through
Got this weed-head chick, she always catch me doing shit
Crazy girl, wanna leave me, but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
'Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like, ""Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?""
I'm like, ""Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked, and now you want half""
I got this ho that after twelve million sold
Mami's a narcoleptic, always sleeping on Hov
Got to tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow
I've got so many girls across the globe, I love

[Outro: JAY-Z, Biz Markie, Q-Tip & Slick Rick]

Common... Common...

[Common]
Yeah, yeah
Hi-Tek

[Verse One]
Free the rhyme or risk a dig into a deep sound abyss
Unit in the stash the beats and never found the shit
Experience like Hendrix, keep my sound enriched
Cats ask about my stitch, to me they soundin bitch
In my sounds the glitch of hatred, for cats who ain't make it
I'mma give it, as far as you can take it
Tried to take the safe way, told you there's a gateway to skinny
Many can find it but few can climb it
I'm open-minded like a pothead
Doin what I gotta do to keep the spot fed
In the climate, of locked dreads, corn-rows, torn souls
Worn hoes, who been molested by they uncle
I bundle, amongst you cold mother-uckers
The world is bitter, like baby mothers
Look how far El Dorados and wine bottles drug us
Least God and the sun love us, it's the Sun God

[Verse Two]
Everywhere is broken glass
Nephews smokin squares, nieces smokin grass
Try not to say shoot around my daughter, she already know the blast
Catchin the future, don't know who threw the past
It's the, year of the snake and the hidden dragon
Niggas is fake like bitches braggin
Listen to the ocean and the stars, keep my vision in motion
In motion like cars
I'm down to Earth, at times I feel closer to Mars
The world is yours, I'm hopin it's ours
Some say the Gods is crazy, I see God in our babies
Child of the sun, I allowed it to raise me
(.. from a distance) niggas tried to appraise me
I'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me
My days be spent, behind dream's tent
Through the sun the divine being is sent
It's the Sun God

[Verse Three]
Letters from prison sayin we need a better religion
I'm a rebel that listens from a eighty-seven position
I can't crystalize the mission lies within
Born to die even in death we begin
It's heavy 'jo learnin what we already know
And carry low swing on a chariot slow
Brothers stick though remindin me of revolution
If the drama comes I'mma have to up Papa's gun
It's the Sun God, yeah

[Intro]
Fuck Jay Z!
(What's up, niggas?
Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dog
You? What?!)
Fuck Jay Z!
(You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga)
Fuck Jay Z!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive
Who's the best: Pac, Nas and B.I.G.? Ain't no best
East, West, North, South, flossed out, greetings
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne!
I got this locked since '91, I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music
Check it

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Interlude 1]
Ayo, pass me the weed!
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel
And kiss the motherfuckin' ring!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint (Dick!)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G
Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live?

[Interlude 2]
I… will… not… lose
God's son across the belly
I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
Ill Will, rest in peace!
Let's do it, niggas!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you, ‘cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child?
Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot ‘cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now ‘cause of your looks?
Negro, please! (Ha!) You no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane
To Irv, to B.I.G. – and Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha!
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z – damn, you on Jaz dick!
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss!

Salt n Pepa, Lyte, EPMD, LL, Run-DMC
KRS-One, Rakim
Most of them artists used to dance
And still get respected in the street
Don't be scared to Bankhead or Bogo
Or move as far as sold Michael Jackson 43 million
Shoot, errbody have the zipper jacket
And half of these thugs have the glove to match, ya feel me?
Yo, it's ok though, if you wanna be hard and ice grill
And Harlem Shake at the same time, whatever
Let's just have fun, it's hip-hop man, this is hip-hop!

[Intro: Jay Z]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B holla

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Chorus: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Chorus: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, Shorty, I know what you need
I got everything you need
I promise I ain't gon' hold out neither
I'ma give it all to you, baby
It's burnin' on, bust it

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

[Verse 1: Spliff Star]
We been together for a few years, shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road, hardly ever home
Always busy this, busy that, can't talk on the phone
I know you aggravated, walk around frustrated
Patience gettin' short, how longer can you tolerate it?
Listen, Ma, I'm just motivated
I do this for us, stuck on the grind, tryin' to elevate it now

[Verse 2: Baby Sham]
Ayo, to really be honest you stuck with me through my whole struggle
Can't even express through words how much the kid loves ya
I'ma stand as a man, never above ya
Well, I could tell that you different from most, slightly approach you
And the ill shit about it? We don't sex every day
But when we sex, we tease in a passionate way
I love the way you touch it, those little elaborate ways
Got the god feelin' released to relax for the day
It's on you, Ma

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you

I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Shh, Mami listen
I feel your love for me, baby, and how it move through you
I been longin' for the moment to talk the truth to you (Listen)
I'm never home, I always get up and go
Puttin' you through the unnecessary rigmarole
I never meant to put a thousand pounds of stress on your head
I love the way we sleep and how we always cuddle in bed
Baby, I stay embracin' your patience, sheddin' your tears with me
I ask you, my mami, please continue to bear with me

[Verse 4: Rah Digga & Mariah Carey]
We started out broke, constantly on the roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from loosies and buses, and fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed, still got each other back (Yeah, yeah)
Word is bond, never screwed none of these industry cats, boy
We like Scull and Mulder, walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game, watchin' our seeds gettin' older (Yeah)

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you (I'll give it to you)
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it (Gonna give it to you, boy)
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

[Bridge: Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey]
Yes, you know I'll die for you (Uh)
And you know I'll ride wit' you (Come on)
I will always try wit' you (Uh)
And give you my love and cry wit' you (Let's go)
I will climb a mountain high (Uh-huh)
Until our love will touch the sky (Uh)
So baby come and get more close to me (Mariah)
'Cause this is where your love is supposed to be, baby (Tell 'em)

[Verse 5: Rampage]
I pull up to the house in a yellow Lamborghini
It's been a few months in PA, you haven't seen me
You lookin' good in that Gucci bikini
38 carats, your ring lookin' freezy
No matter what I do in the world, you never leave me
Fall back, Ma, I'll make your lifestyle easy
I appreciate the things you do to please me
Lookin' at my daughter, you'll never do me greasy

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

Flash Cartier when you open up the door - slide these on baby
So butter, still relate to the gutter
Just your lifestyle's different, spirit uplifted
Fell in love with a cat who's gifted
Turn you back to paradise, damn I missed it
Pop a bottle, light a purple candle

Pour bubbly, glow from the flame make your skin shine lovely

Take you to your peak I know them other cats don't
And it won't stop - this is beyond paper
First I get your mind right, then I might drape ya
Never pimpin, raise my girls well
Young thoroughbreds get schoolled by Uncle L.L

Minimum, ten percent go to God first
Lay back baby, close your eyes
Ice on the pinky finger froze your thighs
So much shade baby, the waterbed fries
Walk around nude in the suite yellin, ""Recognize!""
Do your dance, baby pour me a class

Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious

What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)

The only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash so I could roll up
Hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)
You got beef with Styles P, I come to splatter the hood

[Chorus]
""I get high - high - high - high"" (Every day)
""I get high - high - high - high"" (Every night)
""I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory"" (All the time)
""HIGH on your memory..."" (Every day)
""I get high - high - high - high"" (Every day)
""I get high - high - high - high"" (Every night)
""I get high - high - high - high"" (All the time)
""High-ighhhhhhh...""

[Verse 2]
Aiyyo I
Smoke like a chim-in-ney {*inhaling*}, matter fact I
Smoke like a gun, when a killer see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did; add to that
That I smoke like the hippies did, back in the 70's
Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes, I get high when
Bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the M-5 pedal when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

[Chorus]
""I get high - high - high - high"" (Every day)
""I get high - high - high - high"" (Every night)
""I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory"" (All the time)
""HIGH on your memory..."" (Every day)
""I get high - high - high - high"" (Every day)
""I get high - high - high - high"" (Every night)
""I get high - high - high - high"" (All the time)
""High-ighhhhhhh...""

[Verse 3]
I'mma smoke till my lungs collapse; I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious and I know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta ride for a livin'
With my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die (anybody)
This is S.P., dump it in you bitch, I get high

[Outro]
""I get high - high - high - high"" (Every day)
""I get high - high - high - high"" (Every night)
""I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory"" (All the time)
""HIGH on your memory..."" (Every day)
""I get high - high - high - high"" (I am the Ghost)
""I get high - high - high - high"" (Float with me)
""I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory
I get HIGH on your memory"" (I get high like birds to planes)
""I get HIGH on your memory, HIGH on your memory""
I get HIGH on your memory"" (I get high like, smokin' dubs to the head)
""I get high - high - high - high""
""High-ighhhhhhh...""

Uh, yeah, a little bit louder, right there

[Verse 1: WC]
Click click, boo ya! Dub kicked the frame in
Nigga, let the games begin
As I stand in, tossed the tall can on a campus
Out the land of the scandalous, takin' penitentiary chances
Sick wit it, off the ric wit it
Blue beenie knitted; freshly acquitted
Grind-grimey, the big body and a big body
With lyrics and 'draulics hotter than the Mojave
Sellin', global bailin', career felon
Escalade, 3-braid beard wearin'
Fuck it, I thug for free and thug to eat
Niggas call me hog head 'cause I love the cheese
Gangstas, hustlas, pimps, if ya follow me
Let me see ya put them hands up like a robbery
I solemnly swear to stay down and slang the C
I spit in the name of the streets

I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)

I'm gonna ball (I'm gonna ball)
Hold my hood up high
In the name of the streets

This the itty-bitty nigga from the city they call LB
What you know about the D-O-G?
I keep my peeps wit' a bag of treats
On the streets my nephews beat that beat and keep that heat
In the cut and indiscrete
Me and Dub-C crippin' cousins in this industry
A lot of y'all pretend to be
Wanna 'ce' friends wit' me, and then wanna sleep wit the enemy?
Want some, get some, bad enough take some
Suckas poppin' off, I'm 'bout to take one
Break son, make done, don't want none
And just 'cause we talkin', what you doin' C-walking?
It's not just a dance, it's a way of living
Now if ya C-walking, ya best to 'ce' Crippin'
And that goes for kids too, and R&B singers
Nigga, quit Crip walking if you ain't a gangbanger

Who's the next out the city to blow, coming at 'em
In a Pea coat and Stacy Adams, you're lookin' at 'em

On the Westside highway shoulder, nigga I'll blow ya
Like a windshield, leave yo' mind on the windshield
And have yo' whip doin' windmills, that's what rain feels like
When it's hittin' a little harder than drizzle
And pickles flyin' out pistols, got niggas cryin' they Christians and
I can't believe shit has come to this
It's unheard of, now it's gonna reign down murder

[Chorus: Celeste Scalone]
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the reign is...

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Yo.. yo..
God only breathes with the best of them, bury the rest of them
A storm is comin', I got a hundred mile runnin' head start
On these niggas 'cause it's murder for life
Drugs, bitches, and money be my only vice
But I'm livin' life in the fast lane, doin' the damn thang
In the Ferrari hard top watchin' Hard Rain
It's a damn shame, no more games
No more love, baby boy I throw back slugs
Through your Green Bay throwback, I hits that up
And let you know where the reign is from
You ever heard of mixin' whiskey with Jamaican rum? You get Biggie
Mix gin with a little cocaine, you got me
And my style is a little too savage to not be
Be looked upon as one of the illest to MC
Y'all niggas want it with me? That shit's unheard of
'Cause niggas, now it's gonna reign down murder

[Chorus: Celeste Scalone]
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the reign is...

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Nobody loves me...
Sometimes I wish the good Lord would come down and hug me
I take a look at my life, it's gettin ugly
And now I know that you all wanna slug me
I can get above it, it's my life and I dug it
Even though I live it close to the edge
I'm gettin' closer to death, with eve-rrry little step
That I take, in the awake of my last days
I hope the sun shines with a light rain
That would mean the world shared my pain
And now the world could be happy again, smile
'Cause if I ever walk The Green Mile
You can look at me and blame it on my lifestyle
What can I say? I was raised as an only child, lonely
Poppa disowned me, so the streets raised me
To call me crazy is not unheard of
Now it's gonna reign down murder

[Chorus: Celeste Scalone]
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder
I think the rain is comin' back (murder)
I think the reign is comin' murder

[Intro/Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
You can't roll a blunt to this one
You gotta, you gotta well, ya gotta light a J
You gotta puff a J on this one [inhales]
You can't even drink Crist-OWL on this one
You gotta drink Crist-ALL
Buy some red wine, a little Gaja 9-7
You're so contagious, I can't take it
This is for the grown and sexy, uhh
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? Ooh, oh
Yeah, can I get my grown man on for one second?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be hanging with Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to trot, lady!
Excuse me miss, what's your name?
Can you come, hang with me? (Ooh, oh)
Possibly, can I take you out, tonight?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You already know what it's hittin' for
Ma, I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin' on
50/50 venture with them S Dots kickin' off
Armadale poppin' now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin' is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST
Who else you gon' run with? The truth is us
Only dudes movin' units - Em, Pimp Juice and us
It's the Roc in here!
Maybach outside, got rocks in ears
PJ's on the runway, Young got air
I don't land at an airport, I call it the clearport
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sexcuse me... damn!
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
I got my Gaja 9-7 on right now
Lady
You gotta puff a J to this one
Can't roll a blunt up to this one boy
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? Ooh, oh (AOWW!)

So hot to trot, lady, what's your name? Ooh, oh
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be rollin' wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z
You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sex-cuse me, damn!
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
You might go, you mighta gotta go get you some Scooby Doo's
Lady
Gotta throw on ya Scooby Doo's; those are shoes by the way
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Gotta throw on Scooby Doo's, hehehehe
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? Ooh, oh
This for the grown and sexy, only for the grown and sexy
So hot to trot, lady, what's your name? Ooh, oh
Woo!
You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one
You can easily get past, but that chapter is done
...but I'm done readin' for now
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role
I'm 'bout to give you all the keys and security codes
'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin'
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Sex-cuse me, damn!
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Lady
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? Ooh, oh
So hot to trot, lady! What's your name? Ooh, oh
You're so foxy girl, you're so hot to trot

105,I Can,God's Son,Nas,2002-12-13,253720,57,"

[Intro: Children's Choir]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Outro]
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music

107,My Name (feat. Eminem & Nate Dogg),Man VS Machine,Xzibit,2002-08-13,272506,57,"

[Intro: Eminem]
This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
What up, X?
Just hit 'em

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I float like Big's spirit in this bitch, I'm ghostly
Rush me, 'cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'll have my motherfucking ass kicked by Moby
If I let some bitch in the can like 'Bis cop over me
To do war and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop to that level to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pulling two gats out
With bullets (*bang*) I finally got something to shoot at now

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the Glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who really want their name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me and make ends meet
Now was I blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse?
I follow (Ugh!) hearse after hearse spit verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy ""Dance"" Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree
So now!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap, my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga, let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Why do you hate me? I came from nothing
Blood, sweat, and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me? You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West Coast without me
Cut with the bullshit, I struggle for survival
And now you tryna act like my rival?
Watch what you say, partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life, nigga, it's not worth...
All the pain (All the pain), all the agony (All the agony)
All the horror (All the horror), all the tragedy (All the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now!
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day, you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the FUCK! you think you talking to?
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in front of you!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap, my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I could have been like Treach, poom-papped and slapped him
Purple, for mimicking him with two rapping Urkels
I could have snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I square dance 'cause I'm sick of rapping circles
Around these clowns, steady trying to call me out
It's like I'm listening to motherfucking dogs meow
You'd probably do better trying to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about (C'mon!)
(I) No gangsta, you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ether
(Not) I should've crossed your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
(X!) Pass me the weed
I'ma put my ashes out on his ass for the last time, man:
Watch your fucking mouth

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap, my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga, let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho, say my name

[Outro: Eminem]
It's the last time, man
I'm through

This is how it's goin down, nigga, Rule, baby

To the world over (Oh, oh), B. Brown

I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug loving
And I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging

[Verse 1: Ja Rule, Bobby Brown & Both]
I know you're living your life faithfully, safely, away from me (Woo!) But you miss being next to me, don't you?
Don't let her love haunt you, lust for what you want
Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to interfere
Or intervene
Of me peeling your wide body out of them tight jeans
Wrist on freeze, see it's on me
Shoes 19, coming through in that new Bentley thing (GIRL!!)
The talk of the town, the tease of the city (yeah)
You and I make headlines like Lo and Diddy or Bob and Whitney (WHO?)
I'm here 'cause the Lord sent me (WHO?), pound puss like a pugilist
Grin real devilish and freak bad bitches (oh-ohh)
Forget the story, I know you're getting bored
And that nigga ain't getting you horny no more, is he?

Loving, thugging you, baby...

And I know you're getting bored, baby

Sweet thing, living it
Won't you let me let you live it a little bit
I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
But here's how to deal with it
On your weekly visits
Use a code name to protect the innocent (ha)
Maybe I'm too generous
Generally believing that all women want me
They don't wanna get even (girl, I know)
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God?
Betrayal, trust, this thing of ours  (GIRL!!)
Should be secretly held sacred, 'cause I love it when you pop your body-body
And move your body-body
Drink up on the Bacardi and rub up alongside me
I love to see you wild and free
But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is you need my heat (Ja!)
'Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me
Loving, thugging you, baby...

[Chorus: Bobby Brown (Ja Rule)]
And I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug loving (thug shit)
And I know you're getting bored (know you're getting bored)
Dealing with him (dealing with him)
I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug loving
And I know you're getting bored, baby

Rule, baby
Baby girl, here I'm holding your love hostage
The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless (WOOOO!!!)
'Cause you been getting at me in many a ways
Now tell your man to watch his back and duck from strays
'Cause I been in a rage (GIRL!!) lately (yeah)
Hoping God'll forgive me for all the sin, all the women
All the drama I been in and it's just the beginning (WOOOO!!!)
I hope you (watch) so you could see that nigga ain't built like me (like me)
Black Sheep of the family
But we one in the same, that's why we get along
Freak off and get it on
When we make love looking something like soft porn
Now tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him?
Where the brightest of days just look dim
And you fucking with a loser, baby, you can't win (HA, HA)
When it's said and done you're gonna need me
Loving, thugging you, baby...

[Chorus: Bobby Brown (Ja Rule)]
And I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging (Rule, B. Brown)

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
Cuz lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you’re hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, “You make me sick”
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart’s half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
Cuz I can’t see you bouncin’ with somebody else
It’s a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn’t give it up
I can’t let us self-destruct

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin’ all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL’s, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin’ you the lovin’ was good
Too busy frontin’ in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don’t ever let go
I’mma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don’t say no
Cuz I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it’s time for the pain to go, ya’know

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better

[Bridge: LL Cool J & Pharrell Williams]
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin’ we gon’ die together
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
Do you think I meant to hurt you? No
So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin’ we gon’ die together

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
It’s a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin’ you foul names
Actin’ like females is all the same
I’m gon’ love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I’ll never be the same
I’mma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you’re back in my life
But this time I’mma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin’s gonna tear us apart, promise

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better

Do you think I meant to hurt you? No

(funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party)

[Ludacris]
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lift a hand
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Stepped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud like Timmy
Uh had to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap get my head sucked right
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite
Hard to the core
Core to the right
You drop down turn around pick a bale of cotton

[Chorus]
[People in the background chatting]
Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real
I know I know, I don't even care about her beign preganant by Michael Jackson
You know what we should do
We should go get her album when it comes out
There she go, there she go, there she
Heeeey Misssy

[Missy]
Hi Missy?
What's up fools?
You think I ain't knowin yall broke Milli Vanilli
Jay Jay fan wannabes ain't over here gossiping bout me?
Yo how bout you buff these Pumas for 20 cents so your lights won't get cut off
You soggy breasts, cow stomachs
Yo take those baby GAP shirts off, too
You just mad cuz Payless ran out of plastic pumps for the after party
Yo by the way, go get my album
Damn!

112,Where I Wanna Be,Informal Introduction,Shade Sheist,2002-01-01,260026,53,"

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This is where I wanna be
Right here with my loved ones
Smokin on some weed
You've got chronic won't you light it up?

[Verse 1: Shade Sheist]
Now who's that kickin in the gate for the West?
Shade pop with flows that seep holes in your vest
Half nigga with the words
Half run up in your spot to talk shit
Where I'm from, we prone to lick shots
Now Dogg Pound Gangstas put me up on game (put me up on game)
Now that I'm here a lot of shit gon' change
Mister quick to buy a chain, mister let the chain hang
Showin off to broads, I'm mister quick to get to bang
Now you might catch Sheist gettin bent in every coast
Still the nigga with the heat gettin rid of every coat
Still fuckin' with Mizz, we run triz when we bored
And you know I got the X, twenty's what they hittin for
See me if you wanna score, cause I got what you need
Or you can see me in the club, tinted SUV
Gettin in for free, I'm bout to make my name known
Sheist pull a heist in this bitch just to get it on (what.)

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Check this out
You see, how I figure this thing
We can, all take over this game
If we, come together do this shit right
We can, all have a piece of the pie
You know, how I figured this out
I just, took a little trip down South
Soon as, I set foot off the plane
It was, just like a family thing
You know, the gangsta's hard to decieve
So I, took a little trip to the East
I'm not, slow so I can't wait for the game
I'm not, broke so I'm in bulletproof everything
When I, touch down it ain't like a think
They ain't, trippin off nothin but bank
So I, quickly dispose of my shank
If we, if we ain't got us nigga where could we hang?

[Hook: Nate Dogg]

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Yeah, show me somethin I ain't never seen
I step in the house party with a gangsta lean
Dogg Pound Gangstas we strikin back again (back again)
Ready to ride in the 'lac again {*tires squeal*}
Givin it up for T-Boz and Mack 10 for doin it
This ain't nothin but a gangsta reunion
New York and California, the places to be
Nate Dogg and Kurupt broadcast for free
We at the DoggHouse where the dogs at
You wanna get with me?

[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too, like Attack of the Clones
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you egos spread rumors
We're survivalists turned to consumers
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words melt in my mouth, they hot like a jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Cor' bailed me out
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like Bed-Stuy
Through the red sky with the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some G. Rap shit, Living to Let Die

[Hook]
This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
I've been thinkin' I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
By, by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
By-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
By, by-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
By-by-by-by, by-by-by-by
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
We keepin' it gangster, say ""fo' shizzle"", ""fo' sheezy"", and stayin' crunk
It's easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stayin' drunk
Yo, our activism, attackin' the system, the Blacks and Latins in prison
Numbers have risen, they're victims lackin' the vision
Shit, and all they got is rappin' to listen to
I let them know we missin' you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin' is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin' you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly, the TV got us reachin' for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars, the ones that be readin' for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners, Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin' to rely on, we get high on
All types of drug, when all you really need is love
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon: imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop

[Hook]
This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'
And I've been thinkin' I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

[Outro]
Yo-yo-yo, yo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs
Y-y-y-yo, yo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs
Y-y-y-yo, yo

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I damn near shot 'em

[Verse 2: Kyjuan]
Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; may niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

[Verse 3: Ali]
Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

[Verse 4: Murphy Lee]
Don't get me wrong, man
Now Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 5: Murphy Lee]
We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin' there as if I'm shootin' free throws
I said, ""Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you Murph, especially in the white 'n blue""
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice""
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), ""Thanks for the advice""

[Verse 6: Ali]
I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops, which the clear sole
But it's Timb's and fat laces when it's cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit' them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho'
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""

[Verse 7: Kyjuan]
O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and put wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, they know I'm buyin dem

[Verse 8: Nelly]
Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my Daytons

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 9: Kyjuan]
I wore spurs at first now there's tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

[Verse 10: Murphy Lee]
Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (you wildin') fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

[Verse 11: Nelly]
Now sometimes I get em free and some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and the platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

[Verse 12: Ali]
Now in the box is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine (peep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones

Hands on the ball and I won't drop (no)
Half-assed rhymes that you can't watch (no)
It ain't cause I want to, it's cause I got-ta
Get a grip while the gettin' is good
Before the game is 10% skill and 90% Hollywood
I don't need that, I don't believe that
E'rybody gon' get hurt, if I do dirt
I flirt with the idea of quittin' the game
Nah!! I'mma evolve continue to change
It take brains, balls and backbones to get it on
And keep it on, we keepin it movin, to each his own
So I spit about it, whatever I feel about it
I'm just bein' real about it; X get hot, nigga forget about it
Speech don't fail me now
Dedicated to the enemies and friends that hold me down

(We) back online (We) came to ride
(We) build (We) stack (We) multiply
(We) stay on the grind (Until) we die
And back for mo', cause we can't get enough

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Above the rest, accept no less
Go ahead, check the game, be my guest
Somethin brand new and heavy to get off my chest
Win time after time 'til there ain't none left
Hardhat, punch the clock, back to work
I'm bigger, stronger, faster, built to hurt
Everybody and anybody who come to my party
Like they ready to get rowdy and touch somebody
Who's that nigga y'all came to see? ""X!""
Often imitated, but cannot be, ""X!""
What's next, collect respect like paychecks
Straight to the bank with my bitch and have safe sex
What do you believe in? I believe in
Seizin the moment, livin and dyin to spit with a vengeance
Here for redemption - been around forever
Y'all cats was just too blind to listen

[Hook: Nate Dogg, Xzibit]
(We) back online (We) came to ride
(We) build (We) stack (We) multiply
(We) stay on the grind (Until) we die
And back for mo', cause we can't get enough

[Bridge: Nate Dogg, Xzibit]
It ain't my fault.. we keep droppin' hits
And you can't spit like this, so I'm takin' yo' bitch
It ain't shit changed.. we gon' bang like this
And I'm drinkin' this fifth, we still don't take no shit

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I got a sixth sense, that tells me you ain't worth six cents
I'm sick with my sixth sense
Whattup Doc? I'm gettin' down to business
Crooked as the cops in the Rampart district
Lose yourself in the music, move it or lose it
Abuse it, let's booze it, please don't confuse it with the
Next man, it's the X-Man rollin
Stand firm, solid as the ground I'm holdin'
Make mine Golden, permanent State issue
Stacked with the wealth that you can't take witchu
Long range missile, if we got issues
I'mma squeeze this shit and nobody gon' miss you
I'mma keep swingin 'til the medics come get you
I'm busy, stay off my line, you can't get through
Peep the design from the mastermind
Yo Dre, bring that shit back one more time!

[Hook: Nate Dogg, Xzibit]
(We) back online (We) came to ride
(We) build (We) stack (We) multiply
(We) stay on the grind (Until) we die
And back for mo', cause we can't get enough

(We) back online (We) came to ride
(We) build (We) stack (We) multiply
(We) stay on the grind (Until) we die
And back for mo', cause we can't get enough

[Intro]
Bravehearts, Bravehearts, Bravehearts…

[Verse 1]
Now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step with
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack — where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 2]
This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 3]
I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk chazzers
Like Pun said: you ain't even en mi clasa
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

[Outro]
And I like a little sassiness
A lot of class; Mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader at last, this a don you with
My 9's will spit, niggas lose consciousness

[Verse 1]
Little shawty, we used to be on the phone all day
Talkin' to the sunshine shinin' on my bald head
Now today seem strange
No call on my celly, no name on my caller ID
Callin' you up and ya OGs sayin' you ain't home
What's really goin' on? I wanna know
So gimme a call and let's play no games
I'm playin', you want the plane
Don't point a finger over herre
I bought you a fur coat for your birthday
And this the things I get shorty?
Over there you starin' mad
That I went out with them other chicks
I told you they ain't shit!
They were just some buddies from high school that I went to
Where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em
But I called you up but you wasn't home
Baby girl when you get this message, gimme a call
I'll be waitin' at home

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I wanna know how it feels to be loved, be loved
Sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I wanna know how it feels to be loved, be loved

[Interlude {* sung*}]
Any other night, you'd be at home waitin' on me, yeah
(What's goin' on?)
Any other night, you'd be actin' like a bugaboo, ooh
(What's goin' on?)
Any other night, you'd be callin' me, stallin' me, ha
(What's goin' on?)
Any other night, I can guarantee a page from you, ooh
(What's goin' on?)

[Verse 2]
Hmmm, but tonight seem different
Man, it's about this fishy (I'm so confused)
Cuz I ain't even get shhhh
My wife ain't hit me on my pager or cell
And when I CALL HER, I keep gettin' the damn voice mail
What's goin' on? Yeah I know I'm wrong
For goin' and comin' home at 'bout four in the mornin'
Hopin' ya ""Home Alone"" like Caulkin
But I picked the wrong time, and respect will be expected

[Chorus w/ad libs]

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick of bein' lon-
AHH, don't finish yo statement
You alone call me, I'll be yo replacement
Put me in the game coach, you can let that lame go
Let me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles
Cuz ain't no mo' better, freakier feller
From the Field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy
Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a late of neck bones
Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me
Cuz I be goin' and goin', rowin'
With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'
Hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'
Something so pretty as you at home alone
That's unbelieveable, like when the cow jumped over the moon
Now, I never put nothin' before you
That's like eatin' cereal, pickin' a fork over a spoon

[Chorus 2X]

Just gimme a minute of your time, baby

Let me talk to these motherfuckers
Ugh!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Guess who's bizzack? You still smelling crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxing them roads; when I was huggin' it
Niggas couldn't do nothing with it, straight from the oven with it
Came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling ""guts"" every time, drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?
Me and the Facemob, every time we face off
Face it, y'all—y'all niggas playin' basic-ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall (Woo!)
Homie, I'm in the drop with the A/C off
That's why the streets embrace me, dog, I'm so cool!

Don't make me relapse, back to the block with the four

From the womb to the tomb, a hot pot, a jar and a spoon
Tryna make me forty thousand and move
Motels, star-studded, rockstars and goons
Plainclothes wanna run in my room (Woooo)
But nigga, guess who's bizzack? It's your boy, Facemob
Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake, dog
Give niggas a break? Nah, you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for? To go against the grain? (No!)
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy-paint the '88
Don't got no wholesale, 'cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here, take these five stones, and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta set my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets, fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fo'-shizzle, my nizzle
Your block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make for sure I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war, and you ain't making a dime, haha!
'Cause I got shit to lose; a nigga out here paying his dues
My baby walking, gotta get him some shoes
It's a new game brewing, let me give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, ha
It's a new game goin', lemme give you the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, haha! (Whoa)

Guess who's bizzack? The boy, B-Mizzack (Yeah)
AKA Mr. Crack-A-Brick (Straight)
Turn a whole one from a half a brick
Look, I mastered this, you can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make you swell up if you gasket-clipped
You can make your chips swell up, you don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watching traffic switch
Young'un, never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz (Huh)
And keep your whole hood on flip (Ugh)
Like old box-spring, pissy mattress shit
No, won't box a thing, strictly blasting shit
I hug the block like quarter-water (Ugh)
Shit, I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
'Til, like, deuce in the morning
With the old heads (Ugh), slangin' loose quarters (Quarters)
This Philly cat back at it (At it)
Still fucking with them crack addicts, still busting with that black-matic

Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm tryna show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting, be damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits
While Pharrell keep talking this music shit

[Chorus: Pharrell]
(Ahh)
Grindin' (Ahh)
Grindin' (Ahh)
Grindin' (Ahh)
Grindin' (Ahh)
Grindin' (Ahh)
Huh-huh

[Verse 2: Malice]
Patty cake, patty cake, I'm the baker's man
I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
Then disguise it as rap so the Feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got wholes for a dozen
Even 11-5 if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me
I'm just grinding man, y'all never mind me

[Chorus: Pharrell]
(Ahh)
Grindin' (ahh)
Grindin' (ahh)
Grindin' (ahh)
Grindin' (ahh)
Grindin' (ahh)
Huh-huh

[Post-Chorus: Clipse & Pharrell]
Grindin' (whoa)
You know what I keep in a lining (whoa)
Niggas better stay in line when (whoa)
You see a nigga like me shinin' (grinding!)
Grindin' (whoa)
You know what I keep in a lining (whoa)
Niggas better stay in line when (whoa)
You see a nigga like me shinin' (grinding!)

[Verse 3: Malice]
My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame
From days I wasn't able, there was always 'caine
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame
Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face
Glock with two tips whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake
I'm grindin'

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
I move 'caine like a cripple
Balance weight through the hood, kids call me Mr. Sniffles
Other hand on my nickel
Plated whistle, one eye closed, I'll hit you
As if I was Slick Rick, my aim is still an issue
Lose your soul in, whichever palm I'm holdin'
One'll leave you frozen
The other, noddin' and dozin', I'm grindin' Jack

[Chorus: Pharrell]
(Ahh)
Grindin' (ahh)
Grindin' (ahh)
Grindin' (ahh)
Grindin' (ahh)
Grindin' (ahh)
Huh-huh

[Post-Chorus: Clipse & Pharrell]
Grindin' (whoa)
You know what I keep in a lining (whoa)
Niggas better stay in line when (whoa)
You see a nigga like me shinin' (grinding!)
Grindin' (whoa)
You know what I keep in a lining (whoa)
Niggas better stay in line when (whoa)
You see a nigga like me shinin' (grinding!)

125,My Block - Nitty Remix,Better Dayz,2Pac,2002-01-01,322573,56,"

[Intro]
Damn, take a ride to my block
My block, that's right! Hehe
'Round my motherfuckin' way

[Verse 1]
They got a nigga sheddin' tears, reminiscin' on my past fears
‘Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breast
The underlying cause of my arrest: my life is stressed
And no rest, forever weary; my eyes stay teary
For all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black-on-black crime legendary
But at times unnessecary, I'm gettin' worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested but open fire?
Life in the pen' ain't for me ‘cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares for us niggas on welfare
And who cares if we survive?
The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin' on a 4-5
My neighborhood ain't the same, ‘cause all these little babies goin' crazy and they sufferin' in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggas give me props
Forever hot, ‘cause it don't stop – on my block

[Hook]
Livin' life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

[Verse 2]
Now shit's constantly hot on my block
It never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain when her son drops
Black males livin' in hell, when will we prevail?
Fearin' jail, but crack sales got me livin' well
And in a sense I'm suicidal with this Thug's Life
Stayin' strapped, forever trapped in this drug life
God, help me, ‘cause I'm starvin', can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep ‘cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
'Til this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start, I felt the racism ‘cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit, the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star everywhere I went
In my heart I felt alone, out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home – on my block

[Hook]
Livin' life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

[Verse 3]
And I can't help but wonder why so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's in a drive-by
Swollen pride and homicide don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives – Mama, come inside!
‘Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community
But now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us as to stone, them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin' black life
But I can't blame the dealers; my mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know you feel my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hangin' out, pickin' up game, sippin' cheap liquor
Gamin' the hoochies, hopin' I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, stayin' strapped
Fantasies of a nigga livin' phat but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losin' focus – on my block

[Hook]
Livin' life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

[Verse 4]
And block parties in the projects lastin' way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break night
Used to play fight with my homies, but they stuck in the pen'
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend
In my mind I see the same motherfuckers ballin'
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young niggas understand this
Growin' up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on the fast times, past crimes
Tryin' to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is everybody know my name
Swear they all know me, and lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feelin' pain
For all the niggas that I lost to the game – from my block

[Hook]
Livin' life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

[Outro]
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed away
From all the blocks that I'm from
112 street, 7th Avenue, New York, Uptown, knahmsayin'?
183rd and Walt, my block – that's right
122nd and Morningside, my block – that's right
Decatur Avenue, Baltimore, my block – that's right
And the Jungle, Marin City, that's my block – that's right
Los Angeles, haha – that's my block too
Oakland, can't forget Oaktown – that's my block for sure
And all the other blocks around this motherfucker
Houston, Florida, St. Louis, Tennessee, Miami, Chicago
All y'all niggas stay kickin' up dust
Represent the motherfuckin' block

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
Yeah baby

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Bad Misses, Throwing raspberry kisses on me
You looking for directions?
Girl I feel your vision on me
Just don't let him see you sweat'n
And we ain't suppose to be involved
Knowing when we get it off, Girl I mean it all
Keeping you fiending 'til you taking it tossed
And when I'm breaking it off
Its no denying the fact it's wrong
Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason you gon'
Is it because he's superficial
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
And get stripped and shown, the way to get in the zone
The cost, dealing with this you won't be takin' a loss
You need to leave him alone
And roll with the one who's breaking you off

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
Yeah baby

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Brother down the hall
The one you bound to call
Workaholic so really I'm rarely around at all
What we started got serious repercussions in court
We had a chance to turn back, but love that was long
Late nights, twistin' somethin' listenin' to niecey sing
She got the beefy, you tellin' me you deeply appreciate the company
The time we spend 'I feel the same; It's a shame you ain't my girlfriend'
Cause listen: you need a brother with that physical fix
That come through in a mix for you with no head tricks or fraud
You need a new position, somethin' to get you open like its Eucalyptus got you ready to go for your's
Come on and work wit' meh', you won't get hurt wit' meh': Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainleh' (certainly)
Dealing with this you won't be takin' a loss; you need to leave I'm alone and roll with the one whose breakin' you off

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
Yeah baby

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Rollin' down the highway, listenin' to Sade sing the way the smooth operator move my way
You sitting beside me
Looking like Friday Foster
Pam Grier structure look at your body
Keep each other thirsty
Kisses like Hershey
But lips is sealed
Cause we don't need the controversy
I say I'm in town, You say you want it in the worst way
You probably told your man it was your it was ya lil's birthday
Meanwhile, Its champagne chilling in ice
You ready for the freakiest things you done in ya life?
We breaking down like we Road dogs pullin' a heist
You making sounds like the vibe got you reaching your heights
Prepare for flight, this is your captain
I'm getting strapped in
Theres no denying the strength
Of'dis attraction, girl
Working with this you won't be taking a loss
So stop fooling your man and roll with the one
Who's breaking you off

[Bridge: Musiq Soulchild]
Baby, Baby, Baby... don't you worry bout...
Nothing cause I'm coming to handle you no doubt
Whenever you want, that thing you need, I got it
I'm there and I aim to please
I'm coming over to give it to you..
Baby... baby...

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
I'm coming to break you off (beat started.....start-started..)
Yeah Baby

You can find me drunk, whippin' it might crash
Or find me chillin' with crackers who like thrash
Find me in court, smokin' that nice grass
Burnin' the flag, all in the name of white trash
It's Harvey baby, Christ on the arm, I'm gnarly, baby
Fuck with me? Not hardly, baby
And you know the flow ungodly, baby
So let's party, baby

I take 'em to my home, they call it the cockpit
Time for take off, the panties they drop quick
Now that's first class fuckin', ain't that some fly shit?

All my life been po'

We came in the game, plain ya see
Average man when the rest was ashamed to be
Nappy head and all, ain't no changin' me
Ooooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh...
So rough it was, downright wrong I tell ya
Nobody never gave us nothin' but tough time and made us somethin
Different stretch of road, new somethin' to see
Every state on the map, a different somethin' to eat
Daps and handshakes, it meant nuttin' for real
Everybody makin' a killin' man, showin' no feelins
Walkin' off collectin' pay, it's the way of the world
Can't change it, so I guess I'm gon' pray for the world
Sometimes I ask myself, was I made for the world?
I scream this to you, and I say it to the world
Nappy then, Nappy now - Nappy for a bit
Knee-deep, head over heels in this country shit!

[Skinny DeVille]
Even though I picture better days
I'm thankful for the chance I got to say amen
The Lord done blessed me with his grace, I wish this day would never end
We represent the slums, where we from, we feel they bump
Polish shot off on these presidents, and hardtimes they go and come
Some take up off, without the chance, to make it at all
Who woulda thought Skinny'd be the one that's, makin' this call
Lord, help me out, tell me where I went wrong
I'm tryna find a righteous path, although it's, never been long
I gotta do it for my sons, they tellin' me, ""Daddy be strong""
We gon' make it through these hardtimes
Even though they go and they come
Ya absolutely right, for somethin' happen to me on last Tuesday night
It's plain as day, man they... with this World Trade
Naw brave any order but confoldure
Better make it home when nothin' seems to matter
That's when, see, everything can go - any which way
They got me fooled, see the Henny with the J
Front po'ch, chillin' broke, country folk, I'm Nappy with my ways yo

[Hook]
All my life been po'
But it really don't matter no mo'

And they wonder why we act this way
Nappy Roots gon' be okay, okay

[R. Prophit]
It's a blessin' we woke up this mornin'
All my colored folk stressin', come let's join hands
Got to cope with the pressures of bein' po' man
Poppa taught me an order, survive for no man
Nappy blossomed from the Roots, course we gon' stand
Prophit grew from a juvenile to a grown man
Ya gotta take responsibility for ya own man
Zonin, two blunts a mo'nin, by sunrise sometimes
I love to hear my woman moanin', it's on again
Damn I hope you play this song again
The soul cleansin', the melody just rev my engine
Not a lot of things but usually just appendin', but lately
Been searchin' for Benjamins, saw my folks locked in the tenements
And it don't make no sense (what) children and sentencin'
Broadcastin' from the slums, that's why I'm writin' these sentences
Just lower my income, (what) though we ain't finish it

[Hook]
All my life been po'
But it really don't matter no mo'

Get your c-uh-c-uh-car, playa gems gon' shine
And tell momma get a mink, baby girl let's ride (That's right)
You a number one stunna and we gon' glide
And go straight to the mall and tear down the inside
Prada, Gucci, full-mink leather (Leather)
Burberry's cool, Coogi sweater (Sweater)
Twenty inches, pop my feather
The Birdman daddy, I fly in any weather
Alligator seats with the head in the inside
Swine on the dash, G-wagon is so fly
Number one, don't tangle and twist it

See the steerin' wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani
With your baby momma, player's where you can find me
Cruisin' through the parkin' lot on twenty-fours
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed-out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot (Turn left)
Where your wife really love me cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the 3-wheel Benz (Skrtt)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go, (Uh uh) boy can you top that
I'ma show you some shit, rookie, press that button
The trunk went ""uh-uh"", and all of a sudden
Four 15's, didn't see no wires
And then I heard (Boom) from the amplifiers

Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp, (Ho-ho-hood rich) I stay shive
Can't pay my rent cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, cause I'm still fly (Ho-ho-hood rich)
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E class
But that's alright, cause I'm gon' ride (Ho-ho-hood rich)
Got everything in my momma name
But I'm hood rich, la-da-di-da da-da-da-da

[Verse 3: Birdman, Mannie Fresh]
Let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins
Impala loud pipes, drinkin' the Henn'
It's the Birdie-Birdie Man, I'll do it again
In a Cadillac truck twenty-fours with tens
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
Six bad broads flyin' in at nine
New Suburban truck with the porno showin'
Up and down and up they goin'
Bodies on the Roadster, Lexus, you know what
That hard-top Bimmer, yo Ma, that's your truck
I'm comin' up, the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly
430 Lex with the convertible top
And the rims keeps spinning every time I stop
Got a Superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shive, I stay shive
Can't pay my rent cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, 'cause I'm still fly

[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get, get, get down!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.""
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, ""Nobody leavin'
Everybody—""

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Verse 2: Nas]
Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded ""cool,"" but told me out here this how motherfuckers—

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Outro: Salaam Remi]
All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you really look at it
My folk against your folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody got to make a change

131,On My Block,The Fix,Scarface,2002-01-01,214533,46,"

[Verse 1]
Every day, it's been the same old thang on my block
You either working or you slanging cocaine on my block
You had to hustle, 'cause that's how we was raised on my block
And you stayed on your hop until you made you a knot
On my block, to hang out was the thing back then
And even when you left out, you came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Bellfort, to Scott
Reed Road to Phlox, we know the spots
Smoke weed and rocks, drink all the blue dots
On your block, you pro'ly bred a Fat Pat or 2Pac
Or Big Pun, or B-I, your homeboys from knee-high
And even when it was storming outside, that nigga'd be by
That's me, dog, on my block, I ain't have to play the big shot
Niggas knew me back when I was stealing beers from Shamrock
And my nickname was ""Creepy""
If Black June could see me, he'd be tripping
And I'd bet he still try to tease me

[Hook]
My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy
My block, we probably done it all, homey, believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

[Verse 2]
On my block, we duck the nigga-haters and the cops
Fuck a IROC, we race Impalas, chromed-out
On my block, it ain't no different than the next block
You get drunk and pass out, and they back you to the house
And when you wake up on the couch, you going right back at it
On my block, when you're that fucked up, they laugh at it
On my block, it's just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas, making your mark
On my block, we're cuing all the time, playing dominoes
Keep the Swishers sweet down until my mama goes back inside
Then we can fire, pass it around a few times to get high

[Hook]
My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy
My block, we probably done it all, homey, believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

[Verse 3]
On my block, everybody business ain't your business
What's going on in this house is staying here, comprende?
On my block, you had to have that understanding
'Cause if you told Ms. Mattie, she went and told Gladys
And once your mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, they set your ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets, shellshocked
Who never quite got right; now, they inhale rocks
On my block, it's like the world don't exist
We stay confined to this small, little section we living in
Oh, my block, I wouldn't trade it for the world
'Cause I love these ghetto boys and girls
Born and raised on my block

[Hook]
My block, where everything is everything, for sheezy
My block, we probably done it all, homey, believe me
My block, we made the impossible look easy, for sheezy
My block, I'd never leave my block, my niggas need me

Cot damn!
It's a new day
Cot damn!
But that nigga wanted money
Hoooo, uh, hoooo, uh
Hoooo, uh, cot damn!

[Verse 1: Malice]
Uh, they just can't understand or fathom my demeanor
Unapproachable appearance to how I pack the ninas
Out of two Clipse, they say Malice the meanest
Got love for guns and caine, let nothin' come between us
You mistook me for a rapper, huh?
Well that makes me an actor, cause I would rather clap a gun
And buck on them niggas who hate
Who wanna be in my shoes? Live my life but can't carry my weight
I understand that the envy is part of the game
But make no mistake, you and I, we are not the same
Naw bitch, I'm liable to splatter ya shit
Light up ya world 'til you start to stagger and shit
Watch how them hollows straight rattle ya shit
And I leave it to y'all to freestyle and battle and shit
That's not me, I'm more at home with the chrome
Or at play wit the yay, moving 12 for a zone, I'm gone

[Hook: Pharrell]
Cot damn!
It's a new day
Cot damn!
But that nigga wanted money

[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]
God damn, when that white hits the pan and
Comes back hard, I can account for every gram and
The streets molded the man I am
The pimp, the hustler, the crook, the killer, gorilla
Traits of a blow dealer, cost my fame
I hustle, I'm rich, blow scrilla, I'm the torch that, carry the game
The flame I throw, crack change came from blow
Push the O's, six lay close
Hug the streets, I hug the beat, change flows
Thug the streets, my love is deep, my pain shows
My heart's on a sleeve-a
Nigga that they gave they soul and hearts to mistreat you
Nigga told they breaking my heart on the streets so
Watch the phonies, watch ya homies, we pop-pop, drop you homie

[Hook: Pharrell]
Cot damn!
It's a new day
Cot damn!
But that nigga wanted money

[Verse 3: Pusha T & Pharrell]
They call me Pusha for one reason
Cause I keep that sniff all seasons
Whether the price is up or down
I keep a mound to pitch from, you don't have to shop around
When it come to that money, I get stealth
Three guns is fortune, and I don't mind sharing my wealth
Dawg, I know about life
I been around the world thrice times, I mean what I say
From that Panama sun to France's Champs-Élysées
Grind so deep-rooted, I can't turn away
To sell base is now somewhat therapeutic
Hear what I say, please don't confuse it
My verses heal, like Curt Mayfield's music
(I'm your pusha!) Damn right, I treat ya nose to hook ya
And only pull back to cook ya, partner

[Hook: Pharrell]
Cot damn!
It's a new day
Cot damn!
But that nigga wanted money

[Verse 4: Roscoe P. Coldchain]
I be damned if I die of starvation, things is fucked up as is
So I bangs my cabbage; do you not know the most effective
Way of gettin' money? Pull yo gun rapidly
And watch you see the situation be corrected
Lord Heavens, why must I live so devilish
They say whatcha do comes back on you two times
I shoulda been died, but I'm still walking around with two nines
Who wants to be a millionaire? Me, and you ain't got no more life lines
You a snitch nigga fighting crime, go ahead and tell the police
Cause every move you make, I'ma throw a slug
And hope you choke blood, nigga, on every breath you take
Not to be broke, cause Coldchain's fate witness
Naturally spitting from me, human gat, field to the limit
Head to diminish, loud niggas talking gibberish
Grind beef, I deliver it with complimentary service
For certain, live in the living room, searching to hurting you

[Hook: Pharrell]
Cot damn!
It's a new day
Cot damn!
But that nigga wanted money
Hoooo, uh, hoooo, uh
Hoooo, uh, cot damn!

[Skit: Female Voice]
Dear Diary, here I am once again writing to you 'bout this bitch-ass nigga
You know I was fuckin' with him an' all that
Supposed to be a creep thang
I understood about his bitch aight, I accepted her
But then he gon' come with this bullshit
You know I thought I had time invested in this motherfucker
He gon' tell me, you know, ""Things need to change a lil bit
We need to slow down a lil bit""
Slow down for what?! Not for that bitch!
I know you not tryna slow down with me for that motherfucking raggedy ass bitch
Yo girl this, yo girl that
Your girl is a motherfucking fake wearing all that fake ass shit
She buying out of somebody else's motherfucking truck
See, one thing 'bout me I'm an authentic bitch

You still buy her fake motherfucking shit
Her and that teeny lil ass motherfucking car
You gon' throw some cheap ass twenty dollar rims on that motherfucker
You think you got some motherfucking bag?
Bitch you ain't got no motherfucking bag
I showed you the motherfucking ropes
I showed you how to motherfucking dress with that lil bit of money
That you had at that point in motherfucking time
I drained yo' motherfucking ass
I drained yo' motherfucking ass broke
And here you gon' riding round in a '95 car tryna get a 2002 bitch motherfucker

[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro: Jay-Z & Bobby Byrd]
I'm not trying to be no big thing, no, no
You gotta let this one breathe, Just'
Just let it breathe for a second
I'm not trying to give you no advice
Yup! Hovi's home!
The newest addition to the Roc: M.O.P
I don't claim to be no philosopher
""The Blueprint 2"" is on its way
I know y'all hear my footsteps out there, I'm coming!
But I sure know, this is life, baby, baby
Let's go get 'em, Just'!

[Interlude: Lil' Fame & Bobby Byrd]
Time to dump (Fire!)
Dump (Fire!) dump (Fire!) dump (Fire!) dump (Fire!)
You don't know, what you're doing, doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1: Lil Fame & Billy Danze]
It's the MO-P! (Yes!)
And the ZIP code is 1 (1!) 2 (3!) 3
And motherfucker, we coming, 100 miles and gunning (Owwww!)
I'm still running with cats that rob
From the era of eggshell 80s and hatchback Saabs (Same game!)
Operation for this industry lockdown
We still tote hammers that go BLAKOW! Run up if you wanna
Believe me dog, these hammers with they owners
Fuck your G up, have you in blue Pampers, in a coma
And your family now mourn—look, seventy pounds gone
A little fuck, shriveled up, with a hospital gown on
(We holding it down, homes!) Keep pushing, we fell bastards
To get over, we grind with slippery shell tactics
Chippety-frail bastards, your tracks need tune-ups
Lil' niglet, what the fuck you recording for? Nick Jr.?
(The game ain't changed!) It just got harder
Plus we sponsored by Laze, Dame Dash and Mr. S-Dot Carter
Brownsville (Yep!) we stomp through this bitch all day (Oh)
Rock with my cock out, face the crowd and piss said stage (Uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 2: Billy Danze, Billy Danze & Jay-Z]
I'm from the G side of things (Oh), where we ride and bang
With a heat that'll flame, that's how we got the name:
(Warriors!) Embedded in your brains
And someone should be telling 'em the veterans have came
And we're better in the game, you better make it rain
(Twenty-seven a gram) My man, it's better than cocaine
Now everything will change and this Family will rule the world
And you haters can eat a dick up 'til you hiccup and 'url
A decade on the grind (Uh) nigga, I paid mine
So it's my time to shine and for you to ride the pine
I won't sit back and rap like these dumbass kids
I been around, I put it down, I ain't these young ass kids (M.O.P.!)
The OGs repped and survived around this motherfucker
(FIRST Family!) We kept it live around this motherfucker (Oh!)
When it's crunch time, we do it our wizzay
Fo' shizzle, my nigga, learned to grip pistols in BK

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Woooooo!
Turn my music high, high, high, high-er

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
More fire, more Rocawear attire
More money, more murder now that M.O.P.'s hired
More further for the Roc empire, y'all won't serve us
Y'all nervous, know them guns on full service, ready to fire
One body, two body, three body, four
Young sitting on paper, I'm above the law
Young shitting on haters, I ain't fucking with y'all
For my Brownsville neighbors—""How About Some Hardcore?""
And it just get worser, every time I sign my signature in cursive
Just add another million to these verses
One million, two million, three million, four
And the money's really worthless, I'm pissing you off on purpose
My nephews situated, and my mama is straight
So I'm ready for whatever drama should come my way
And you niggas rapping to me so your drama is fake
You dudes is noodles, I got more ziti to bake
You dudes is cake, I keep two biscuits on the waist
Razor blades under the tongue, I will eat your face
Appetite for destruction, I am starving today
Got a money-hungry lawyer that'll eat the case
And that's just food for thought, don't let it go to waste
Nigga, bite the bullet until you stuffing your face, ha!
I done forgot more than you ever learned
What you don't know'll make your home a permanent urn, nigga!

[Outro]
Do you believe it?
(Ohhhhh nooooo!) Oh no!
You don't know, what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
Do you believe it?
(Nooo) Oh no!
You don't know, what you're doing, doing, doing, doing
Do you believe it?

Lookin' for these better days

[Chorus]
Better days, hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

[Verse 1]
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin' weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids
Wanna try now, then lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches 'em, clockin' the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
'Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same, too many murders
Too many funerals, and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried, plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days

[Chorus]
Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' back as an adolescent
Who would've guessed that in my future years I'd be stressin'?
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryna keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin' yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
Savin' up for some Jordan's, ‘cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her, but she broke too
And so am I — I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So, we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin' passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin', lookin' for them better days (For better days)

[Chorus]
Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

[Verse 3]
Now, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or separated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gang-bangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
Out in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks
Got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart
Locked you up in the pen', and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell
Doin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail
And me, I'm doin' cool
I settled down, had a family, workin' a night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And I wonder how we ever came to this; I miss the better days

[Chorus]
Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

[Outro]
I send this one out to all the homeboys down in, uh
Clinton lockdown, Rikers Island
All them dudes I was, uh, locked up with, hehe
E Block, F Block, lower H
N-I-C in Rikers Island, downstate
All the peoples I met along the way
Better days is comin', homeboy, keep your head up!

I'm trying to strum like guitars in this beat
And consider riding she'll kick the blahzay spleen
Plus you got a man, but he ain't quite me
The type of man that try to give you what you need
And he wanna know where you are, where you be
Where you going, where you stay, where you subject to be, damn
If I was him I wouldn't even leave
I would trust you what you say that you are where you be
Say he the type of nigga that's hella cheap
Take his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's
See, I'm the type that try to stab in a jeep
Try to take you out to see things and occasionally creep
Yeah, your man is doing things I can't really see
Don't sound too good, it sound tainted to me

[Hook: Dwele] (T3)
Real love (It's so real girl) true love (It's so right girl)
Tainted love (It's real) real love (It's so good girl)
True love (For real love) tainted love (Tainted)
Real love (Yeah yeah) true love (It's so good girl) real love

[Verse 2: Baatin]
How many years does it take for a record to blow?
I'm doing exactly how many licks it took for my hoes
Spending your cash flow cause she was so out ho
Scandal love, cause love full of scandal
Too much chick for that ass she couldn't handle that
Well it's the same tainted love in the music business
People they lose their brain just to get up in this
Let's be a star for a day, everything in life is just okay
People say things they don't really wanna say
Hey but it's okay, cause you're a star for the day
People'll smile at you when they really wanna frown
Well a that's just the way tainted folk get down
Just keep it real and, we'll see
When the situation is tainted love is always free

Love is always free

[Hook: Dwele]
Real love, true love, tainted love, real love
True love, tainted love, real love, true love, real

[Verse 3: eLZhi]
You say you love me, but is it really real?
Would you, fix me green tea if I'm feeling ill
Could you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day?
Dinner by candlelight but you're the main entree
And if so, I do the same with other treats to give you
Trailing rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow
With a bucket of champagne on your night stand
Experience what some women won't in they lifespan
I'm sayin

[Outro: Dwele]
Real love, real, real, everybody knows that love's real love
Someone to trust in you for real
Everybody need love; that's real
I would never want nothing tainted
Wait a minute, what you feel?
Faded if your loving was tainted
True, oh, I know true love is hard to find
Just let it find you; for real
If you found love to keep it real
Keep love from being tainted, being tainted
Oooh then you'll, be, alright
(T3: Just sit y'all, Dwele, on more time, y'all, come on)
Then you'll, be, alright

[Verse 1: Trina]
Wait bitch, I'mma blow my kisses

Y'all niggas know just who this is

With me, this shit gon' cost, you short, then that's your loss
You know this ass is soft, make a nigga go to breaking off
Tell me that you love me baby and get high and fuck me crazy
Get a towel and wipe me off
You want a bitch with no type of flaws
My girls be shopping hard, these hoes be buying cars
In the club buying bars, nipples hard in designer bras
All my niggas who getting cheese, throwback and the crispy Gs
Moet, Cris on freeze, laugh at a tab cuz this on me

Doing things just to touch the cream
So many names wanna fuck the Queen
I live a life like it's just a dream, UH!

JUMP! Give me the beat, then I'ma make it bump
Tell me what you wanna hear, damn, yes it can
Trouble with your man, I'ma pop my trunk
You ain't seen no chicks like mine, you ain't seen no flicks like mine
Gonna make you (UGH!) next to the subwoofers in my 6 by 9
Tell me that you like it raw, tell me that my dick is MWAH!
I might make you famous
And buy you watches by Maurice Lacroix
Tell me if it's new or old, tell me if it's hot or cold
Let me know if it's black and bold, say, ""Ludacris, 6 million sold""
See I ain't got no time for games, and I ain't got no time for lames
How you loving my Southern slang?
Ooh, eee, walla-walla-bing-bang
So anytime you need me call, winter summer spring or fall
It doesn't matter, come one come all

Diamond Princess, just mind your business
These rumors are senseless, your whispers are endless
We living ghetto fab, we spending hella cash
This girl is hella bad, your choice is trailer trash
Too much taste for whores, you saw me grace The Source
You watched me work the Vibe, bitches, I works for mine
One time for these divas, two times for these Visas
Third time I come, I'm breezing, the ice just keeps on freezing
Hold up, I'ma keep it going back to back, I'ma keep on blowing
Platinum plaques, keeping it hood, wet sex, keeping it good
Look, girl, you don't know my angle
A hundred thou on a platinum bangle
My niggas will slow your roll, pussy power, we in control

138,They Don't Give A F**** About Us,Better Dayz,2Pac,2002-01-01,306200,55,"

[Intro: 2Pac]
Y'all ain't never just tripped and pictured
And just looked at the whole situation
‘Cause once you look at it
You know, (really do)

[Hook: 2Pac]
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Some say niggas is hard-headed 'cause we love to trip
Equipped with game so we bang with this thuggish shit
I see you tryin' to hide, hopin' that nobody don't notice
You must always remember: you're still a member of the hopeless
See, you're black like me, so you snap like me
When these devils try to plot, trap our young black seeds
Look it, cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin'
Lookin' for role models, our father figures is basers
Some say expect Illuminati take my body to sleep
Niggas at the party with they shotties just as rowdy as me
Before I fear computer chips, I gotta deal with brothers flippin'
I don't see no devils bleedin', only black blood drippin'
We can change — what your mouth say?
I'm watchin' niggas work their lives out without pay
Whatever it takes to switch places with the busters on top
I'm bustin' shots, make the world stop
They don't give a fuck about us

[Hook: 2Pac]
Now If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

[Verse 2: E.D.I. Mean]
It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did, ‘cause they sayin' you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons, dawg, I don't doubt you
See, the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you
Or them five mouths you forced to feed, not includin' yourself
All you want is wealth, they perceive it as greed
So as you loaded up that MAC and continue to bust
Your mind was on paper, thinkin' they don't give a fuck about us

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I'm seein' it clearer, hatin' the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior, so why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watchin' my nation die, genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath, the aftermath is y'alls
I told you, last album, we need help 'cause we dyin'
Give us a chance, help us advance, ‘cause we tryin'
Ignored my whole plea, watchin' us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust
They don't give a fuck about us

[Hook: 2Pac]
Now If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

[Verse 4: Kastro]
Now, all the homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply, now that's love
Shit, nobody else would give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down, six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong?
How long will I be mourned?
When I'm gone, same song, ain't give a fuck all along
And who am I to blame 'em?
Just do or die through the rainin'
Since they don't give a fuck, I don't; feel what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 5: Kadafi]
Now, thug niggas die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic or closed casket for our troubles
Pressed in times, we busted, like bubbles
With the police, this nation's peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin'
Man, I still hustle, so I'm dyin' certain
So why spent your time poor and workin', I see no reason
So I stay ballin' season to season
Why you stuck thinkin' that they give a fuck?

[Verse 6: Napoleon]
You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga, you're lyin'
‘Cause half of my niggas long gone
Buried in the dirt just for tryin'
Sometime I think my block is dyin' and that is awful
To wake up to another day, shit ain't changed that's awful
I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted
While I'm layin' in the coffin
The shit comes around so often; so tell me somethin'
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin'
Nigga, I'd be soft if I ain't go through the struggle
I'm doin' the same thing you did at my age, and that's hustlin'
On the edge of straight bustin'
Well, since you don't give a fuck, I be frontin'
I'ma drink my Hennessy like it ain't nothin'

[Hook: 2Pac]
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
They don't gives a fuck about us
But while I'm kickin' rhymes
Kick it to they children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm gettin' high
I'm watchin' as the world goes by
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
They don't gives a fuck about us
But while I'm kickin' rhymes
Kick it to they children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm gettin' high
I'm watchin' as the world goes by
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
Riiise… riiise!

139,'Till I Collapse,The Eminem Show,Eminem,2002-05-26,297786,83,"

[Intro: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

[Outro: Eminem, Nate Dogg, Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

Uh uh uh
I just gotta bring it to they attention dirty, that's all..

You better watch who you talkin bout; runnin your mouth, like you know me
You gon' fuck around and show why the ""Show Me"" get called the ""Show Me""
Why one-on-one you can't hold me if your last name was Hanes
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France; but you swear I'm from Paris
Hundred-six karats - total? Naw that's per wrist
Trying to compurr this - my chain to yo' chain
I'm like Sprint or Motorola - no service, out of your range
You out of your brains, thinkin I'mma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside takin your sleeves off
As much as we's floss, still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin bitchin and cryin - suck it up as a loss
Cause your, acts is wack, your whole label is wack
And matter fact, eh eh-eh eh a-hold that

[Hook]
I.. am..  #1 - no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down & write it
I.. am.. number one
Hey hey hey hey hey hey - now let me ask you man
What does it take to be #1?
2 is not a winner and three nobody remembers (hey)
What does it take to be #1?
Hey hey hey hey..

Do you like it when I shake it for ya, daddy? Move it all around?
Let you get a peep before it touches the ground?

Hell yeah ma I love a girl that's willin to learn
Willin to get in the driver's seat and willin to turn
And not concerned about that he say, she say, did he say
What I think he said? Squash that, he probably got that off eBay
Or some, Internet access some, website chat line
Mad cause I got mine, don't wind up on the flat line
Ohh if my uncle could see me now
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin my style right to the ""down down""
Can't leave out the store now better wait 'til they calm down
I got hella shorties, comin askin, ""Yo where the party?""
Ohh lordy - will I continue to act naughty?
Mixing Cris' and Bacardi, got me thinkin fo' sho'
I'm not a man of many words but there's one thing I know - Pimp

[Hook]
I.. am.. number one - no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it
Hey I.. am.. number one
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Tell me now Dirty
What does it take to be number one?
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers (tell me)
What does it take to be number one?
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

Check it, uhh, check, yo
Aiyyo I'm tired of people judgin what's real Hip-Hop
Half the time you be them niggas who fuckin album flop
YOU KNOW! Boat done sank and it ain't left the dock
C'MON! Mad cause I'm hot; HE JUST - mad cause he not
You ain't gotta gimme my props, just gimme the yachts
Gimme my rocks, and keep my fans comin in flocks
'Til you top the Superbowl, keep your mouth on lock
Shhhhh.. {*crickets*} I'm awake, ha ha ha!
I'm cocky on the mic but I'm humble in real life
Taking nothin for granted blessin e'rything on my life
Trying to see a new light at the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel but I speak The Truth
I heat the booth - Nelly actin so uncouth
Top down shirt off in the coupe, spreadin the loot
With my family and friends, and my closest of kin
And I'll do it again if it means I'mma win

[Hook]
Hey
Dirty I.. am.. number one - no matter if you like it
Here take it sit down and write it
I..I..I am.. number one
Two is not a winner and three nobody remembers
Number one
Cause two is not a winner and three nobody remembers

Security on my dick bitch, I don't give a fuck

It's just a fly love song, what

[Verse 1: Common]
Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green, girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind, baby follow it
Smile, happiness, you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole, being is beautiful
I'ma do the best I can do
Cause I'm my best when I'm with you

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Pharrell Williams]
Come close to me, baby

What's it without you? (Nothin', nothin')

[Verse 2: Common]
Put down your bags, love
I know in the past, love
Has been sort of hard on you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit

Protect and provide for you

Hope you're not tired, tonight, tonight
(Hope you're not tired, tonight, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 3: Common]
You helped me to discover me
I just want you to put trust in me

[Verse 1: Zaakir]
Check it out now...
I work the pen to make the ink transform
On any particular surface the pen lands on
Zaakir is hands on, what's the beef?
The Cooley High Cochise high post techniques
I drape off poetic landscapes and shapes
Illustrate the paper space off the pens that paint
Then design what have a National Geographic a magic
With tailor-made status and plus flavor that's automatic

[Hook: All Jurassic 5]
We're not balling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden
(""On a stage I rage and I'm rollin'"")
We're not balling, or shot calling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden
(""On a stage I rage and I'm rollin'"")

[Verse 2: Marc 7even]
Melancholy mundane so I tame the hot flame
Big rings, fat chains, and y'all quest for the same
No name, use fame, strictly new to the thang
We stay true to the game and never bring it to shame
We tight like dreadlocks or red fox and ripple
We pass participles, and smash the artist in you
The saga continues, this I won't get into
Cause there ain't enough bars to hold the drama that we been through

[Verse 3: Akil]
Yo...
We still the same with a little fame
A little change in the household name but ain't too much changed
We in the game but, yo not to be vain
I refrain from salt grains to season up my name
We entertain for a mutual game from close range
Steady aim, I drum at your head to hit the brain
I'm labor ready, Rhode Scholar for the dollar
Work for mines pay me by the hour

[Hook: All Jurassic 5]
We're not balling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden
(""On a stage I rage and I'm rollin'"")
We're not balling, or shot calling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'
We holding onto what's golden
(""On a stage I rage and I'm rollin'"")

Hip-Hop music

[Verse 4: Charli 2na]
Yo...
Well, it's the verbal Herman Munster, the word enhancer
Sick of phony mobsters controllin' the dance floor
I'm in them dark places, catch you when you stark naked
Your heart races as we pump you for your chart spaces
The tart tastes be bringing these hot styles through
Some of you bum a few cheers from shock value
Word power can plow through acres of cornfields
Paragraphs cut like warm steel, preform ill...

[Hook: All Jurassic 5]
We're not balling
We take it back to the days of yes y'all-in'

But I'ma hit you as soon as I'm right over there
Right in front right? Yeah, okay, aight got you

[Verse 1: AZ & Nas]
Son, who laced you with the ill haircut?
Lenny, he blessed me with the sharp blade, that nigga's paid
He make a pretty penny
Yo, you hurt 'em with the new Prada's
True, check mines they royal blue
My shits is baby blue
They powder blue, yo' shits is hotter
You hotter with them frames on
Nigga you James Bond, and you stay low
Y'know my style bab' bro
Yeah, make dough, manicure, facial, face glow
Fuck it if you say so; I keep it P.I.!
That's how we break hoes
We throwin' ivory dice across the concrete
And of course that don't make him your man because y'all palms meet
We had boxes bumpin' La-Di-Da-Di
Shotties was blastin', pellets jumpin' into everybody
They never got me
Was cool with all the park shooters, sparkin' bazookas
Sharpen your tutors, 'cause we don't pardon the snoozers
Yo son I wouldn't change my life for nothin'
And that ain't like you for frontin'
Who's the nicest? Nuff talkin', light somethin'

[Refrain: AZ and Nas]
Yo we hard hit, just like Camacho and Vargas
Who's the target
Now watch how we close the market
We both hard hit, just like Hagler and Hearns
Add the math, be concerned, if it's beef you burn
Yo it's sorta like, Poitier and Bill Cosby
'Let's Do It Again,' a beautiful blend, let's do it to win
My nigga - my nigga - my niggas - my niggas
My niggas - my niggas - uhh..

[Verse 2: AZ & Nas]
What's today's mathematics?
We had it, we let 'em hold it, we should've sold it
We back at it, we could've grabbed it
But fuck it, just let 'em have it
Al 'Humdulillah
Allahu Akbar, God is the greatest
Planet Mars, we carved in the faces
You couldn't catch us in a car without the bangers
Believe, I touched a couple of movie stars and entertainers
Indeed, one in particular, almost started to name her, ha ha
I was there when you first pushed up and started to game her
Been a long journey, certain shit just don't concern me
They ain't hurtin' shit; we flip, they hire attorneys
Yo I'ma stay custom, 'til I'm old grey and rustin'
Reminiscin the number of chickens that claim we fucked 'em
Bet some badder hoes than them other funky rappers chose
I'm tryin' to wife a chick, light a spliff
Okay, this might be like another part to ""Life's a Bitch""
Bite your lips, who's nice as this? We righteousness
No mic assists, it's murderous - granted the right to flip

[Refrain: AZ and Nas]
Yo we hard hit, just like Camacho and Vargas
Who's the target
Now watch how we close the market
We both hard hit, just like Hagler and Hearns

These bitches swear they in love but it's just the X
Niggas act like my coke ain't long and stretched
Like I don't keep two shotguns under my chest
I flip obsolete, see, I'm the king of the streets
And show motherfuckers how to rhyme on Neptunes' beats
In Miami, Big Pun shoulda won the Grammy
This year I'll bring the shit home to his family
Go 'head and keep hatin' until you receive
Mad volts in your chest plate, hard to breathe
See, you a hater like Star and Buc, nigga, what?

I'm the ultimate, gun on my dick, hoes swallow my spit
Wanna drink every bottle I sip

Let's have fun with it, in the Bridge, my niggas dun with it
Niggas had hit records, but we done did it
Pop a collar, see them chicks? They like to holla N.O. 
You know them hoes already know they gotta swallow
Money like Nutty Professor, fat as fuck
Four Gold albums, ain't none of it luck

Since you seem so tense, release the mutts
I'm connected, the police release my cuffs
Call me Fillmore, nah, nigga, 'cause I'ma feel more

Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks (*record scratch*)

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Slippers, white to breate, 500 Degreez
In that Cadillac Truck on 'em 23's
I'm the boss of the game with the money and fame
All these, naked women that pop champagne
And these, marble floors stay high as Rick James
If you know my name then you know my game

[Lil Wayne]
It's lil whoadie from the hot block with serious flow
Gotta get dough, cha'll won't feel me broke
But, y'all don't hear me though
Til I'm rolling down my window where my grill is show
And you know I probably pump it through the hood on them 24's
Word, rims poking out the side of the err
Glock, have ya ribs poking out the side of your shirt
I'm a 17 nigga and I ride through the turf

[Hook: TQ]
Baby, I'm a stunna

Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?

Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, and my pinky glow cause my rings is so...

Fuck the pee-ple
Everywhere we go we smell like ick yo

[Baby]
See they think cause I stay English turn
That stunna don't ever OZ to burn
I go in each over and ball like a dog
Me and my niggs ball like a dog
Cars on my streets, all on the lawn
Ice in my teeth, all on my arm
Tats in my face, my back and my arm

[Lil Wayne]
Tats in my face, my back and my arm

[Hook: TQ]
Baby, I'm a stunna
I ain't gon change it
Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no

[Outro: Mannie Fresh]
Yo, there it is, ya lil' low life
See, I'm a Bro-fessional - you a rookie
Fuck, a game so serious I could sell a hooker some pussy
That's some serious shit
Oh yeah, believe that
Who we rollin wit?
We rollin wit Cash Money
Oh, I forgot about peace - Peace!
I mean.. piece of pussy, piece of land, piece of property
Just a mind game
Piece of mind, ya know
Piece of something, motherfucker!

One-touch sunroof BUT leave it alone
Hoes see it can't believe it - ""It's goin back on it's own""
Oooooooooooooooh, shit, that's how we do it baby
""Every day like this?"" Seven dayy-ayyys

Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?

You ain't from Russia, so bitch why you Russian?

And we gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck, it's not your birthday

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll that weed up! (Roll it!)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)

And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at yo' bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be

152,99 Problems,The Black Album,JAY-Z,2003-11-14,234626,53,"

[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty

I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing""
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
After the VMA's my baby momma cussed my ass out

Cut the grass around my clique so I could see these snakes
You see 'em back in the hood, it's cause I see they're fake
I preach a sermon 'bout the paper like I'm Creflo Dollar
I pop you punk niggas like I pop my collar
I'm confused, I like Megan, Monica and Mya
Missy's freaky and Brandy's shy, uh
Now take a look at how my lifestyle changed up
I'm on now, God damnit, I done came up
Now you can find me with the finest hoes
Choosin' which whip to drive by what match my clothes
I got a fetish for the stones, I'm heavy on the ice man
If I ain't got a pistol on me, sure I got a knife fam
Get out of line and I'm lightin' yo' ass up
Semi-automatic's spray I tighten yo' ass up - what?

Slow down little nigga, don't exceed your speed

After I'm done you: clappin' the crew
Hell yeah I fuck fans, guess what, your favorite rapper does too
In a minute I'ma have the jeweler makin' my rims spin
My crew run wild like the Jamaicans in Kingston
Nuttin' but bling bling in your face boy; that's why my neck
Shine like one of the shirts that Puffy and Mase wore
I done found a nympho as soon as I pop a bra
She at my balls, head first like a soccer star
You can only stand next to the man if you proper
I take care of birds like an animal doctor
I been out and buzzin', niggas just slept on me
So I'm out for revenge like one of Bin Laden cousins

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Read the paper, look at the news, we on the front page
Yeah we in the Bahamas with AK's on the stage
The ice in the Jacob watch'll make a broke nigga take somethin'
So I gotta keep the fo'-fifth with no safety button
G-Unit get that money, I know some artists is starvin'
But play the game like they rich, to me the shit funny
I know you see me comin'; cause on the front of the Maybach
It say payback for those that hated on me
I hate when niggas claim they bangin' a gang
You ain't a Crip like Snoop, you ain't a Blood like Game
See I been havin' beef, I got my own bulletproof vest
Most of my enemies dead, I got about two left
Until my last breath, I'm sendin' niggas bullet holes
Innocent bystanders get hit tryna be heroes
You know how we roll, everywhere that we go
It's Fo-Fo's, Calicos, and Desert Eagles, yeah

[Verse 1]
Everybody screamed when I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush, she looked like a fool
Nearly petrified because she was taken by surprise
When I kissed the teacher
Couldn't quite believe her eyes, when I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then she just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher

[Chorus]
One of these days
Gonna tell her I dream of her every night
One of these days
Gonna show her I care, gonna teach her a lesson alright

[Verse 2]
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher
Leaning over me, she was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher

[Bridge]
What a mad day
Now I see everything in a different light
What a mad day
I was up in the air and she taught me a lesson alright

[Verse 3]
What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then she just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug her)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug her)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug her)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug her)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug her)

Tell niggas, get they money right, 'cause I got mine (Uh-huh)
And I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine (Woo)
You gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump—is that what you want?
Be easy, nigga—I'll lay your ass out
Believe me, nigga—that's what I'm about
Gangsta! You could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone (Yeah)

Oh no, look who crept in with the .44
Twenty-inch rims sitting on low-pros (Uh-huh)

Go ahead, act up, get smacked in the head with the burner (Ahh)
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty, dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, you heard me? (Yeah)
When the streetlights come on, niggas blast the nines (Uh-huh)
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time (Woo)
In the game there's ups and downs, so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
There ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine (Unh-uh)
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the dropout who made more money than his teachers
Roofless like the Coupe, but I come with more features
I am what I am; you can like it or love it
It feels good to blow 50 grand and think nothing of it, fuck it!

Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop

Let's get it on
We don't give a what-what
We don't give a what-what (Shit)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker, bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker (Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)

[Verse 1: DMX]
Once again it's the darker nigga
Here to spark a nigga, pick apart a nigga
But the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless you wanna get blessed to the chest
With slugs from the Smith & Wess', rest
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dump six motherfuckin' feet of dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty 'cause I play dirty, the mob way
You don't know, fuck it, find out the hard way
A nigga's job is never done, I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
There hasn't been a problem, I dissolve 'em like salt
Lock it up like a vault whenever wreck is caught
And it's my fault, keep niggas on point duckin' down
Niggas like you need to get bust, you fuckin' clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort, never get caught, 'cause I creeps, nigga

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)

Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)

[Verse 2: DMX]
I'm at the crossroads, look, but I'm not really sure which way to go
Should I play the low for what I did the other day?
They on their way, the flow got me strikin' this random
I can't stand 'em, fake-ass niggas wantin' to be the Phantom
Lookin' over my shoulder, 'cause it's colder than it was
Extort shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz
And the buzz from the saw, with the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fuckin' stain
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon' die by it 'cause I'm like knee-deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
'Cause when you look in my face, you see that hard shit
'Cause I done been to Hell and back I ain't with sellin' crack
I'd rather rob a nigga, leave him with a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the GWB
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth, bitch-ass nigga

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker, bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker (Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)

[Verse 3: DMX]
When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I smoke 'em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke 'em
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in 'em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in 'em
My M.O. is manslaughter, kid
'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, 'cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm goin' to Hell 'cause I choose to sin
All my motherfuckin' life I've been the Devil's advocate
Now niggas never even knew the Devil had a kid
But he does, and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know why I'll split your motherfuckin' brains for

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker, bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker (Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'

To get they ass in front of my dick and dance to BIG's ""One More Chance""
I'm catching hate from a glance, but I'm a giant
These niggas is mere ants, I'll stomp 'em wit a shank
Give bitches the back hand, this pimp shit, it's not realistic
Your game is helpless, let's not get it twisted

And stuck somewhere between Gomorrah and Sodom
I'm here to make this rap shit hotter than Harlem

Where Em Laden's hiding and bomb him first
It could be much worse, I could be hotter than your scrubs
Mask and gloves, gun hot to burn that ass up
I'd rather be bossed up with a bunch of broads
The preacher's daughter screaming out, ""Fuck the Lord!""
I may have struck a chord with the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
And God gave me his blessing to handle my business
All these wanksta snitches, let the nina blow kisses
If she some how misses, he gon' meet the mistress
And clap that boy like Birdman and Clipse
I got these niggas all over my dick like hoes

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
(It's on me)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Outro: 2Pac]
They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was more shocked than anything
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him… Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by
I mean, even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what I'm sayin'?
Because there ain't no coming back from that

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll teach you how to stunt
My wrists stay rocked up
My TV's pop up in a Maybach Benz
I'll teach you how to stunt
Nigga you can't see me
My Bentley GT got smoke-gray tints
I'll teach you how to stunt
My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man
I'll teach you how to stunt
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man
I'll teach you how to stunt

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Seven series BM, six series Benz
Twenty-four inches, Giovanni rims
R1 one wheel when I'm on one of them
Ma, that boy out there acting a fool that's him
They say I've changed man, I'm getting paper, I'm flashy
They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy
My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace
Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me
And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show
In the hood they say 50 man your sneaker look right yo
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho
Banks is a sure thing, y'all niggas might blow
I'm fin to drop that, so I suggest you lay low
Buck, he from Cashville, Ten-a-key nigga
We getting them ten a ki', save ten for me nigga

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

I'll teach you how to stunt
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man
I'll teach you how to stunt

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rapping
But the kids used to look up to you, what happened?
Me on the contrary, hand covered with platinum
Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one
On point, cause you get R.I.P.'s when slacking
So the stash box big enough to squeeze the MAC in
Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
Cause I already wear your advance on my neck
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue Yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers
I already figured out what to do with all my features
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers
When it comes to stunting there's nothing you can teach us
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us
Naww, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt
Come with me out front, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO STUNT

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll teach you how to stunt
My wrists stay rocked up
My TV's pop up in a Maybach Benz
I'll teach you how to stunt
Nigga you can't see me
My Bentley GT got smoke-gray tints
I'll teach you how to stunt
My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man
I'll teach you how to stunt
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man
I'll teach you how to stunt

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Chain so icy, you don't have to like me
In a throwback jersey, with the throwback Nikes
I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days
The only thing changed is the numbers on the Range
I bought me an old school and blew out the brains
The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain
My Sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
The ice in my teeth keep the Cristal cold
G-Unit homie, acting like y'all don't know
Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more
I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes
They never seen doors lift up on a car before
Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know
That's how to show these fugazies how it's supposed to go, yeah

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll teach you how to stunt
My wrists stay rocked up
My TV's pop up in a Maybach Benz
I'll teach you how to stunt
Nigga you can't see me
My Bentley GT got smoke-gray tints
I'll teach you how to stunt
My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man
I'll teach you how to stunt
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man

Yeah
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind! (Whoo!)
Ah, uh, whoo, yeah! Ready?
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Let's go!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington (& Mike Shinoda)]
(Can I get a encore, do you want more?)
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Get 'em Jay!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that!
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
God damn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspira-tion-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington (& Mike Shinoda)]
Encore, do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Outro: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington]
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (More, more, more)
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah
Yo, let's bring it

[Hook: Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said, what you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Niggas is so gangsta, niggas is thugs
Niggas'll spend they whole life peddling drugs
Slangin' dope in hopes of one day being able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggas came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is; if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back 'em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's ass-backwards
'Cause them niggas just gon' keep comin' back
And that's when extortion happens
And you struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You'd give anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to do business with me than against me
Niggas get behind mics and ain't even emcees
Niggas get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughing all the way to the bank
Watching the satellite from a Bentley
And you niggas ain't even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissin'
I don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissin'
And media just feeds into these feuds
Tryna add fuel to the fire, this lil' nigga Ja Rule
Talking bout he's gon' slap me? Nigga, please!
You gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview him
All they doing is making fake threats to us through them
And, pussy, you not Pac; I knew him
Pac was a real nigga, you just a fucking insult to him
It's too bad we had to fall out before he passed
'Cause if he could see this shit now, he'd be whoopin' your ass
You're talkin' to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years
Who you got in ya ear? (Pshhhhh!)
I ain't even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit tryna be tough, nigga, you look like an asshole

[Hook: Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said, what you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
They say, ""Why don't we increase the peace?""
The only piece increased is that which deletes your peeps
'Cause niggas run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that fo'-five will cease your speech
Yeah, it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Could've reached ya peak, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm tryin' to be as bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga tryin' to throw me an obstacle
Nigga, I'm not boxin' you, I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the Doc op- on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets, I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue, give a fuck
If all ten of them with you, I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen, vicko
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the woman and bitch in you
All this bickerin' back and forth over who signs who
Curtis pulled your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off, damn!
And quit tellin' all these magazines your plans
How you gon' slap up my mans? You're fict-ious
Nigga, we'll send Stan to come murder your bitches

[Hook: Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said, what you gonna do when shit hits the fan?

And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

[Outro: Obie Trice]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yeah
Go hide behind all the gangstas you want, nigga
Matter of fact
Go get every gangsta from every hood
In the United States of America to back you, nigga
Ain't nobody ridin' wit you
You can't see that?
You fell off, nigga
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Damn

Man, I'm hungry as a motherfucker
Ayo man, damn
What's takin' homie so long, son?
50, calm down, he coming
(*nine gunshots*)
Ahh, ohh! What the fuck?!
Ah, son, pull off, pull off

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
‘Cause I'll come and take your life away

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‘cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say ""Only God can judge me,"" ‘cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when 'Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you mu'fuckas all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
""Hommo"" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
‘Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me

Now I know only I can stop the rain
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Now I know only I can stop the rain
It's not that we gotta do what we do
It's what we know
So to me it ain't nothin' but bein' true, but
Now I know only I can stop the rain
It doesn't have to be the way it is, you say it is
Just because for the past 20 years every day it is (What?)
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I won't even be able to walk out my front door
Without worryin' about comin' to conflict with the law, 'cause
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If I follow Him, they'll follow me
And I'll speak life into the words that you can see, 'cause
Now I know (C'mon) only I can stop the rain
We get away with it everyday shit
But everyday shit catches up with you and when it does you can't say shit
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If I don't, you will, what I won't, you still
What makes us feel like we gots to kill, when
Now I know only I can stop the rain
How many more lives must we lose
How many more times must we choose to trust these fools
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If it ain't broke, don't fix it, I gave it to you straight
Don't mix it, twist it (What) up for some slick shit
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I don't have to talk to it anymore
I don't have to walk to it anymore, I'm out the door (What)
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I wanna find peace with the lord
I don't wanna find a beast with the sword, I can't afford to
Now I know only I can stop the rain
When everyday of my life
Is just a constant fight between wrong and right
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I thank you, Lord for my life
I thank you, Lord for keeping it loose when things got tight
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the pain
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain, stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain because the rain calls on me
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain

We here now, we in the house now, fa sho'
Check me out, I'm tired of playing games

Girl I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, babygirl I'd trade it all
Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Diddy: Fabolous, talk to 'em

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I assume I'm so into you
Cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends wit you
If they ask, I ain't got to say ""whom?"" in them interviews
My sweet thing never believe the rumors, that been ain't true
The fact I had numerous friends is true
But you was wifey, could change me to a groom in a minute boo
Maybe, my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they could make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you where it feel like June in December too
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter through?
I don't know what the other consumers you been with do
I put a day aside, to go to Bloomy's and spend with you
Like any other man, I wanna zoom to the clinic too
But I wanna see if me and my junior's identical
A dude put a wound on the skin of you
I swear to everything, that same afternoon, I'll be in the news
Feel me?

[Hook: repeat 2X w/ changes]

[Verse 2: P. Diddy]
C'mere girl, come and take a walk with me
So I can take you places you don't often be
C'mon ma, come and get lost with me
As far as them other chicks, can't get them off of me
Everlastin', love in a whole 'nother fashion
All I'm askin, is let me cash in
Cause I'd give all the passion, all of the Sean John fashion
In orderly fashion, perhaps when
You figure out, exactly what Diddy 'bout
Cause we could take this whole city out
Now who gon' stop us, who gon' knock us?
Top us, we can't find coppers to lock us
Lear jets and choppers, love hella proper
Seperate the weak from the obso-lete, hard to keep, I got ya
I rocked ya, word to Big Poppa, I got ya, yeah

[Hook] - repeat 2X

Fab: What you want huh?
Diddy: I'm ready to give this all up for you shorty
Get your mind right

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Well this newcomer's known, to move with the seasons
Couple winter lodges, few summer homes
I'm there for every ""ooh"", ""um"", and moan
And make sure when the new Hummer roams, the shoes come in chrome
I ain't new at buying white, yellow, and cucumber stones
That send chills through a woman bones, but life gets gruesome alone
Even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown
Flights, I done flew some alone
Now I wanna wake up everyday with you in a new number zone
Mama mia, it's you I'mma phone
Just to erase all the negative views from your dome
And I promise this fellas G, it's so gangsta it'll calm all that jealousy
And drama you tellin me, so mama come yell at me
So I can put the top down, and we can ""Cruise/Cruz"" like Tom and Penelope
My charm is a felony.......

It's that hoo-bangin' ban-dana cri-mi-ni-mi-nal, the ori-gi-nal

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
Evacuate the building, bitch, here come a plane
No, it's the mad ass Westside Connect Gang
And fuck what you playin' nigga, this who bang
With enough game to drive a square bitch insane
And we number one gunners, no, we ain't stunners
It's real with us homey, killers and drug runners
And Mack need a D-bo in a H2 Hummer
Lookin' hotter than a muthafuckin' L.A. summer, let's go

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they'd run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck?

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
What the fuck is Ice Cube talkin' about?
That's how you get these nuts parked in you mouth
Westside ride bitch, the same old shit
I don't conversate with pussy, I ain't gon get
I don't holla at these hoes that sing like Ashante
Body like Beyonce, face like Andre (Uhh)
Bitch you kinda strangé
But I'm rich so my entré
Got to be bombay

[Verse 4: W.C.]
Have you seen us? Nah
Haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est, nigga
Countless calls and countless charges
Street niggas makin' blunts out of Cuban cigars
Big by the linnas hyp-notic by the liters
With a flank of hoes on us cause the chronic is the greenest
And to my niggas incarcerated and on probation
I'mma stay bangin' for the whole G Nation, nigga

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they'd run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck?

[Verse 5: Mack 10]
It's a Gangsta Nation, if you in, you a G
And the whole world influence by the B and the C
Now, tell the truth rappers, you don't ball like me
'Cause I'm really from the gang, y'all is industry
And while I'm servin' up and comin' young hustlas and cluckas
Bangin' for the hood, causin' havoc and ruckus
You niggas at the label, kissin' ass like suckas
And you're bitches, so sit down when you piss, motherfuckas

[Verse 6: Ice Cube]
One thing I do know, I ain't the uno
Big puno, rap sumo, on pruno (You know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
And my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah, I'm ruthless
You like a stick, pussy, nigga, you're useless
You know the side bitch, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin' on it

[Bridge 2: Mack 10]
Look here man
Check this shit out man look
Ya'll might as well say: ""Fuck it and join this Westside thing, man""
Cause we got a muthafucking Gangsta Nation goin' over here
And once you join this shit you as G as can motherfucking be!
Believe that, homie
Look, it ain't a hit til Nate Dogg spit

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they'd run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck?

[Bridge: Nate Dogg & Ice Cube]
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
(Consider this an invitation, to my gangsta nation)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na

169,Dirt Off Your Shoulder,The Black Album,JAY-Z,2003-11-14,245173,52,"

[Produced by Timbaland]

[Intro]
You're now tuned into the muh'fuckin' greatest (Jigga)
Turn the music up in the headphones (Jigga)
Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off, nigga
I got you, yeah, uhh

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 1]
I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

[Post-Chorus]
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 2]
Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

[Post-Chorus]
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 3]
Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

[Post-Chorus]
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Outro]
You're now tuned into the mu'fuckin' greatest
Best rapper alive, best rapper alive

[WILL]
You'll have to be a little more standoffish
When fellers offer you a buggy ride

[ADO ANNIE]
I'll give a imitation of a crawfish
And dig myself a hole where I can hide

[WILL]
I heared how you was kickin' up some capers
When I was off in Kansas City, Mo

[ADO ANNIE]
No

[WILL]
I heard some things you couldn't print in papers
From fellers who been talkin' like they know

[ADO ANNIE]
Foot!
I only did the kind of things I orta, sorta
To you I was as faithful as c'n be fer me
Them stories 'bout the way I lost my bloomers—rumors!
A lot of tempest in a pot of tea

[WILL]
The whole thing don't sound very good to me

[ADO ANNIE]
Wеll, ya see

[WILL]
I go and sow my last wild oat
I cut out all shenanigans
I save my money, don't gamblе or drink
In the back room down at Flannigans
I give up lotsa other things
A gentleman never mentions
But before I give up anymore
I wanta know your intentions

With me it's all or nuthin'
Is it all or nuthin' with you?
It cain't be ""in between""
It cain't be ""now and then""
No half and half romance will do

I'm a one woman man, home lovin' type
All complete with slippers and pipe
Take me like I am, er leave me be!
If you cain't give me all, give me nuthin'
And nuthin's what you'll git from me

[ADO ANNIE]
Not even sump'n?

[WILL]
Nuthin's what you'll git from me!

[Instrumental]

[ADO ANNIE]
It cain't be ""in between""

[WILL]
Uh-uh

[ADO ANNIE]
It cain't be ""now and then""

[WILL]
No half and half romance will do!

[ADO ANNIE]
Would you build me a house
All painted white
Cute and clean and purty and bright

[WILL]
Big enough fer two but not fer three!

[ADO ANNIE]
S'posin' that we should have a third one?

[WILL]
He better look a lot like me

[ADO ANNIE]
The spittin' image

[WILL]
He better look a lot like me

[ADO ANNIE]
With you, it's all er nuthin'
All fer you, and nuthin' for me
But if a wife is wise
She's gotta realize
Men like you are wild and free
So I ain't gonna fuss
Ain't gonna frown
Have yer fun
Go out on the town
Stay up late and don't come home till three
And go right off to sleep if you're sleepy
There's no use waitin' up fer me

[WILL]
I'll wait up, Annie

[ADO ANNIE]
No use waiting up fer me!

[WILL]
Come on and kiss me

171,The Setup,Cheers,Obie Trice,2003-01-01,193000,52,"

[Intro - Obie Trice]
Oh oh oh oh oh, Ohhh-miiiiiix (hehehehe)
Detroit nigga!

[Verse 1 - Obie Trice]
""Cheers"" the debut, the nigga, the voice, the career, is all new (yup)
You Pepe LePew-ass niggas loved your boo when I thugged her in school (huh)
Made her resort to fuck with niggas like you (hah!)
Me, I gave her obstacle courses
Bust nuts up in that ass, yeah, lots of abortions
You, took it out of proportion
Made the bitch wifey, when you should be plottin divorcin
I put her through the ring, had her wildin' out horse, when
You, bought rings, had her hiding out in Nordstrom (whoo!)
I coach her, help her play her part{whistle}
Catch these bars, you know I play her like a sport (hah!)
Obie is never that nigga paying for that loft
Or payin' the cost for another man to floss (nah!)
I'd rather have my hands on the grands of course
So the plan is creepin' up on your man, pushing The Porsche (what!)

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
Thick thighs but she full of surprises
I swear this bitch is Shady (that's what I know)
Sex on her mind all the time
And you think that, that's your baby (you don't know)
You a good guy that's living a lie
But she told him where your safe be(Detroit!) (that's what I know)
If you cool and she satisfied {I know +Dat bitch+}
How come that bitch just paged me? (you don't know)

[Verse 2 - Redman]
Ey yo, Obie Trice, I know the same bitch (the same bitch)
The bitch with the ear-ring in her clit (Dat Bitch?)
I got photos of her buttnaked
With Manolo's and a pair of handcuffs on her hip (ey yo)
She love coke, doin' lines off my CD (sniff sniff)
She in the bottles like ""I Dream Of Genie""
She got a G.E.D. from nightschool
That stands for ""Gettin' Errbody Dolla"", greeeedy!
I first met her at Magic City, she was gettin' lapdances, and grabbin' titties
When the stripper ain't lookin', she grabbed a $50
Ride out the bitch thong, when the song is on
I'm like: that bitch ain't shit!
She'll put the gun to your balls while swallowing your ""kids""
Before you know it, you got robbed
By four fat chicks that kicked in your door while you was tied
That's the game that bitches play
Watch your back while they walkin' your way
You know her, long hair brown skin
Pussy be whippin' niggas like Lady Heroine
You try to get her drunk, she slipped you a Mickey
Now you the next date-rape victim on ""Ricky""
Bitch fuck with D, I have her legs ""hangin' out the trunk"" like the
""Marshall Mathers LP"" (yup!)

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]

[Lloyd Banks - Verse 3]
Yeah, Lloyd Banks'll never trust a ho (no)
They'll get you ""Set Up"" fast, ""puttin' your hands in the air"" like
Busta's show (yeah)
I got the fame, name, plus the dough
Between your legs and your chin is a few places my nuts'll go (ho!) (hah!)
I'm stubborn in the worst way, so I don't follow up if I don't get the
Pussy the first day (yeah)
Hey, slow down boo, cause' at a G-Unit party
My niggas pattin' the hoes down too (yeah)
They're hungry and they're plannin' to profit
So I get all my hoodrat head with my hand in my pocket (whoo!)
They scheme, but the cannon'll stop it
Thinkin' I'm off point cause I blew about a grand on a chocolate
And even if I'm loose off the liquor (liquor)
I'm reachin', besides everything's bulletproof but my zipper (ziiip! - Obie)
I don't even put my drink down, watch the bitch on your arm
She probably goin' through your mink now (Lloyd Banks nigga! - Obie)

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]

[Jadakiss - Verse 4]
Uh, Yeah, Uh
Yo, when you say ""Kiss is the best"", you're not hypothetically speakin'
If he don't die, I bet he be leakin' (D-Block!)
And I'm in the zone right now, I think I'm 'bout to finish up my album
By the rest of the weekend (let's go)
It's a dirty game, and rule number one (whoo)
You never spend clean money on a dirty dame (yeah)
Bitches pointing like ""Oh, he Kiss!"" (uh-huh)
Once they get a whiff of the purple kush or the OG Crip
Got a hazespot with dubs, a whole D strip
I get it for cheap, the 'ricans throw me shit
My nigga listen, it's enough of 'em (uhh)
So you ain't' gotta be runnin' round' here all crazy, lovin' 'em and
Cuffin' 'em (New York)
Just don't add up, (naw)
She just wanna get her hair and nails done, and tear Fifth Ave up (yeah)
She might cop female 'Gators (huh)
Bad thing is the homie gonna spin her like Spreewells later
Now everything is messed up (yeah)
You wanna deck him, and deck her
Should have only used her from the neck up (whoo)
Instead of taking her to shop
Take her scandalous ass to ""The Doc"", make her get a check up
Now for nothing, you should just stand down
Cause before long, there's gonna be a man down (uh-huh)
But naw, you gave her the world
She gave you a ass to Kiss
And she's still your favorite girl, damn!

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]

[Outro - Obie Trice]
Detroit!
Hahahaha, yeah
213!
Westcoast Connection with Detroit
Detroit Connection, with New York
You can't stop Obie Trice right now. What?
New nigga, new voice, new career, hehe, motherfucker!

I'm thinkin' about snatchin' her up, Dirty, makin' her mine
Look at her hips (What?), look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (Stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (Back)
I like it when I touch it 'cause she moan a lil' bit
Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a lil' bit
I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal

Man, she so stacked and she know that I want that
Her man, he's so wack, girl, can I taste yo cat?
Gave her three hundred to strip, like buyin' a throwback
She stay in the club, like to be seen, she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events (Yeah), cuss out the press when she pass (Yeah)
All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half steppin', she strapped with a nice weapon
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gon' drop
Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops

Then she back it up on me and let it drop (Drop)
Make it hop, boing, like a bunny (Bunny)
Girl, can I touch you where it's sunny?
Or a purse and make you give her some money
She should pose for Sports Illustrated
It's like a picture-perfect site
When she pass, all the other girls hate it

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, it's somethin' special y'know; somethin' epic
Lloyd Banks, you know
'Cause a nigga thuggin' don't mean he don't
Wanna see you smile baby

[Break: 50 Cent]
(Wooo!) I wanna be the reason you smile
I wanna be the reason you smi-ile
I wanna be the reason you smile
After you wipe away your tears and dry your eyes

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
I'm gettin' the feelin' you wanna take revenge
From the conversations we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
That's why it's just me in my Mercedes Benz
It all depends, maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts intact
So every time we separate, somebody's marchin' back
You're amazin' in the sack
Eyes slanted like you're Asian, but you're Black
God bless whoever gave you all of that
If you seen her from the back
You'd understand why they stare like that
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I ain't gotta say nothin', she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes
Up and down, then OHH!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks & (50 Cent)]
Whenever I'm not around, and you feelin' down
Let the thought of me be (be the reason you smile)
I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be (be the reason you smile)
Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be (be the reason you smile)
We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be (be the reason you smile)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
The main reason I been lookin' at you pitiful
Don't amount to half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tiptoed into a crib or two
I've come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky, 'cause I see niggas
When you tease 'em with your physical
She wanna wreck up the room 'til I ain't got no more wind left
Why I want my section 8 princess
My foreign chick bad, but she been stressed
Plus it's hard to communicate
'Cause she don't speak-a no English
I been around the world, state to state
But now I'm back bustin' in your bathroom
Got you laughin' in your shower cap, let's get it on
'Cause I'm leavin' in a hour flat, but it don't matter she's mad
Even when I holla back
All I really need your attention for a while
And, I bet you I can make you smile

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks & (50 Cent)]
Whenever I'm not around, and you feelin' down
Let the thought of me be (be the reason you smile)
I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be (be the reason you smile)
Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down
I provide by any means to be (be the reason you smile)
We done been through ups and downs, had drama for a while
I'm just happy I'm around to be (be the reason you smile)
Whenever I'm not around, and you feelin' down
Let the thought of me be (be the reason you smile)
I don't wanna see you frown, like them kids watch a clown
I wanna bring you joy and be (be the reason you smile)
Baby, you know my style, you know how I get down

[Chorus]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, Shorty)

[Verse 1]
Now, Shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her, 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see
You fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P (P!)

[Chorus]
I don't know what you heard about me (Woo!)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Me)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Bridge]
I'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holla at me
If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

[Verse 2]
Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch

[Chorus]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, Shorty)

[Verse 3]
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

[Chorus]
I don't know what you heard about me (Yeah)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Woo!)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see (Huh-uh)
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me (Huh-uh)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Yeah)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Outro]
Yeah, in Hollywood they say, ""There's no b'ness like show b'ness""
In the hood they say, ""There's no b'ness like ho b'ness"", you know?
They say I talk a little fast, but if you listen a little faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch
Ha-ha-ha, yeah

How you ain't gon' fuck?! Bitch, I'm me!
I'm the goddamn reason you in V.I.P
CEO, you don't have to see ID
I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance

Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over; Luda got something to say

Get wild! Okay

Freeway got the hood on smash
Pop in tape, step on gas and get ghost nigga!
Freeway got the club on lock, step on stage
Set it down leave with a broad, check for her age
Post up, fans suffer circle the block
Call the cops - it's the Roc in your area!
Post up, distribute to the block
Freeway move the rocks in your area!
Yeahhhh, Pop tried to shut me down
Cops tried to shut me down, haters wanna hem me up
What? My Glock carry heavy rounds
Mack carry heavy rounds packed in the Chevy truck
What? You better ring the alarm
Before I cock back, dump on you and your boys
And have black suits, tucked on you and your mom
But back to the song, said she wanna suck on me and the boys
Her ass look good in a thong
And she want me to sneak in the building like Trojans in ""Troy""
Best believe there's Trojans involved
Hats lift over the boy, oh boy

[Chorus: Freeway]
We rip crowds, whole lot of volume and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the place
Get wild, whole lot of style and a little bit of cake
Is all it takes to make her skate
Flip side (flip side) crack vials and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the block
Get wild (Get wild) park keys and a little bit of cheese
That's all it takes to make her leave

With these (triple) O.G.'s
Tell that ho to Tootsie Roll on the pole I'm tryna squeeze
With ease (with ease) then breathe (then breathe)
I ain't Hov', I just know what I know
I'm talkin' O. Sparks five, ride for a dollar bill
Famous up in Hollywood, high in them Holly-hills
I, can't deny how the mamis feel
Higher than the cable bill, slide with your baby girl
P. Crakk and I ain't for play
I got a Mac that'll change your day
Fall back, get your act intact
P-I-M-P U-P H-O-E-S is all the rest
And yes, this is Philly, you welcome to come check us
Crakk, wherever I holla at be gettin I get
Pass her the thing, tell her make it go rrrring
The prince of S.P., is soon to be the king
And we..

We rip crowds, whole lot of volume and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the place

Is all it takes to make the block
Get wild (Get wild) park keys and a little bit of cheese
That's all it takes to make her leave

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Now how many hoes in your motherfucking group?
Wanna take a ride in my '89 Delt
She felt the kid, thumbtack, held the roof
Up on her cell phone, ""Freeway got me in the squadder
He a rider, from the block to the booth""
I'm as, real as they come, the gorillas'll come
Six could chill 'til they come, gotta peel when they done
But let her spend the night, all night
Cause the heat call me a liar
She just like Honey so I called her Mariah
Wanna see, if she got what it takes to carry across state
And travel across state, with things taped to her waist
Mami wanna ride with pa
Bad bitches get scooped like Haagan Daas
And put on the team shoot, put on the Bean bitch
Lean bitch, shoot at they entourage
Hit up the team camp, pull on your jeans bitch

We rip crowds, whole lot of volume and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the place
Get wild, whole lot of style and a little bit of cake
Is all it takes to make her skate

I'm in a drop-top Chevy with the roof wide open
My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
Cause I've been dranking and I've been smoking
And flying down 285 but I'm focused
454 SS, I race Porsches
White leather seats, as fresh as Air Forces
I say, I'm doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on N.W.A, ""Straight Outta Compton""
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys hollering ""What's happening?"" the kid running in
The cliques start dancing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures, buy an onion of good and throw the deuces
I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood, I'm used to it
So if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch Dayton's got the Chevrolet skatin' makin'

I make a million and I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest
Underaged civilian in the tightest ride, I want the best

Been paying my dues since '89, tryna get my cheese
Diamonds gleam when I'm on the scene, they know it's me
Ain't no dream or no fantasy bitch, it's T-I-P
Broad busting, like a baby do a binky
Five karat VVS's on my mothafuckin' pinky
Half of Hennessy and Belvedere's what we drinking
Pimp squad send for broads, what the hell you niggas thinking?
Young nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall
24 inch rim shining when I'm riding cause I'm balling
I'm calling out shots like a pool shark
My tool sparks in the dark when I fool marks
Y'all fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time, I got a strong mind
To grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for a long time
But I'mma get that ass hauled off, fuck around with the clique
They'll be looking for your dick with a stick, nigga y'all soft
So y'all lost, I'mma ball out at all costs, spit game to a dame
Make her ride on this thang 'til she falls off and sucks balls off, I got the

I'm not boucing little shorty, I'm relaxing right now
I'd probably still be trapping if I wasn't rapping right now
Bragging about pistols at the house, well who's strapped right now
Keep on talking folk, I'll lay you on your back right now
Want to act right now, get smacked right now
I'm a buck mothafucka, I don't know how to back down
Clown down here fakin', frontin', talking ‘bout what you making: nothin’
I'm 21 and 10 years deep, that shit to me ain't nothing
I'm raised by the niggas getting head from the jays
Lose your leg when I spray, end up dead from the K
Stay ready for the raid, paid heavy from the yay'

Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

Would you still have love for me?

One's diva'd out, keep her make-up tight
She got her good heels on wit her Jacob ice
And ma love to club, so she stay up nights
And she give me brains just the way I like!
One's real ghetto, don't give a reason
She knows I'm not her man, she don't riff bout cheating
Joey only go to her crib on weekends
Real real late when the kids are sleeping
'Tis the season, no more BS music
Watch and learn, see us do this
Geeks here's new shit
Playboy I keep exclusives to make dudes see less units (c'mon!)

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]

Lotta bitches love when I spit so let me dazzle you hoes
Let me prazzle your head, do and skidattle wit Joe
And get a stack of that money and get a stack of the 'dro
Better back it up money before they crack through the dome

Before I diminish let me handle my business wit y'all
Watching you niggas, you shook! all you looking all nervous

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Yes, yes y'all who ain't believe me?
Don't be fooled it ain't this easy
All y'all so 'n so's shamed, that cheesy
You wonder why people don't go and spend they change on a weekly
(But) Who's fly in rap? I in fact
By myself, no one behind the attack
And fuck Sound Scan, I ain't BUYING that
Cause y'all sell em to the stores then buy 'em back
Now one hot storm, we'll fly and rap
If the rest of you provide is wack
I see creativity dying fast
I'm glad producers charge so high for they tracks (tell em why though)
Now they do it all, you just applying the rap
Honestly now, it's not the economy's down
Now rap dudes suck they own pee hole
The wacker the music the bigger the ego
Fans left suffering, gasping!
And it's embarassing! Jump Off I'm the aspirin
I'm still hungry, I'm still fasting
Y'all fade out, I'm just getting it cracking

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]

[Produced by The Heatmakerz]

[Intro: Juelz Santana]
Yeah, Dipset, uh
C'mon, fuck with your boy
It's Santana, Heatmakerz, where we at?
Let me see you through this
Killa, Jones, Freekey
Yeah man, I'm back at it, come on

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Today's a new day, got the boo-lay up in the suitcase
Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent ya
Tell 'em it's August, I'm gone til' November (yeah)
I need a couple birds, get a broad, have 'em sent up (of course)
Call my bird, get my broad have her sent up (please)
Call my niggas, call my squad, have 'em sent up (please, yeah)
I see a town I'm liking
See some niggas getting money in a town: I like it (yeahhh)
I run up on them with the pound and light it
Like, ""it's my block now, alright, kid?"" (whoa)
He understood me quite clear
Then that thing banged out
And rang out the side of his right ear (woo!)
And I got back to my business, back to my bitches
Back to the kitchen, that Pyrex vision
Pot, I let that white stuff sit in
Get hard, get rock, get to the block and pitching (what)
Yeah I'm sorry but this is how I'm living
And this is how I'm getting, fuck how I get it
Hey!

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music, ay!
I stood at home hand on a chrome, with a zone, flipping the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it, ay! (say it with me)
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandals
Watching Shaft, clocking math

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Now I see death around the corner
Gotta stay high, will I survive?
In the city where the skinny niggas die
Nope, it's the city where the skinny niggas ride
.45 semi on the side, twisting when they drive, yeah
Lick a shot for Big Pop and 'Pac, yeah
One more for Shyne locked inside, yeah
Two more for Cam, for taking over the Roc
Yeah, yeah, it's my year
So, okay, okay, okay, y'all can't fuck with me, no way
Jose or Hector Camacho
TEC blows and watch yo' chest close and tacos
Motherfucker I'm the best, I told y'all before
I showed y'all before, ay!

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music, ay!
I stood at home hand on a chrome, with a zone, flipping the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it, ay! (say it with me)
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandals
Watching Shaft, clocking math

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Killa, Killa (Killa...)
I'm on the west side of Chicago, looking for a bust-down
Don't make me put my two arms up, touchdown! (what up, ma?)
You stay in touch now, but when I touch down
I'm like Buckshot, shorty, Duck Down
Yeah I must clown, I'm from Harlem, uptown
Where we flash money, take your bitch and ask you, ""what now?""
Birds flip a dozen, chicks, it's dicks they suckin'
Swallow my kids, go and kiss they cousin
Yes, they kissing cousins, Toya's kissing muffin
Worse than that, they go home and kiss they husband (shit's foul)
The shit's disgusting
Keep the chickens clucking, keep the pigeons bugging
This on my wrist is nothing
Yeah, it's just yellow hearts and pink diamonds
Where I get the money for this? Don't think rhyming
You fucking with Pablo, Bravo
Mario Villabona, hoe, Ta-to

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music, ay!
I stood at home hand on a chrome, with a zone, flipping the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it, ay! (say it with me)

[Intro - soundclips from ""Scarface""]

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
My buddy, my buddy
Wherever I go, he go
My buddy, my buddy
You can run for your life, when I stick him out the window
My buddy, my buddy
I'll lay ya ass out, motherfucker, it's simple
Stay in your place I recommend
Or say hello to my little friend

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Everywhere I go, I gotta tag along
'Cause my buzz getting strong and they mad I'm on
He ride with me when I pass the mall
And wait for me on the bench when I run a game of basketball
One squeeze'll make a bastard fall, gasp and crawl
You need a bulletproof vest, mask and all
Bring your buddy when it's time to roam (Why?)
'Cause I got hit the last time I left mine at home
My hand bling full of platinum to shine his chrome
He even got closet space inside my home
He ain't never been broke, he glitchless
He's so reliable, I bought him a rubber coat for Christmas
Infrared beam and a scope for distance
The best company when approaching business
He gon' ride with me 'til the end
We all got a friend and mine is a G-U-N

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
My buddy, my buddy
Wherever I go, he go
My buddy, my buddy
You can run for your life, when I stick him out the window
My buddy, my buddy
I'll lay ya ass out, motherfucker, it's simple
Stay in your place I recommend
Or say hello to my little friend

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My buddy got a temper, he dying to pop off
Last time he did the cops had the block all locked off
Take him with me to hustle, stashed him in a trashcan
My fingertips soft, for 4 hours I bag grams
You meet him, your destination's hell or heaven
'Cause I only bring him out for that 187
He don't have a heart, I just keep feeding him shells
He get it popping in the hood, so his name rings bells
Ms. Jones stay on the 3rd floor, she called the cops on me
They came, I ran, I had to toss my other little homie
Niggas know I got new friends so they stay in their place, kid
I stay screaming on niggas and beating up base heads
These niggas ain't thorough, they just like to pretend
Keep fucking 'round they gon' say hello to my little friend

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
My buddy, my buddy
Wherever I go, he go
My buddy, my buddy
You can run for your life, when I stick him out the window
My buddy, my buddy
I'll lay ya ass out, motherfucker, it's simple
Stay in your place I recommend
Or say hello to my little friend

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
We been through it all but yet we both still living
We been in a box but we both still spitting
And when there was beef, you even played your position
Got under the seat until we spotted our victim
At first they wouldn't listen 'til they heard you go off
Remember it was broad daylight in the middle of New York
And little did they know that we was ready for war
Bet the nigga wish he never stuck his head out the door
See whenever you come out, something happen on the block
You the reason that nigga done stopped rapping like Pac
People see you and run, and you ain't even say shit
They just know you ain't nothing to play with
You stay with sixteen homies, and one in the hole
When the first one get out, the next one go
To know where you headed, you gotta know where you been
The Glock stay with me, we friends 'til the end

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
My buddy, my buddy
Wherever I go, he go
My buddy, my buddy
You can run for your life, when I stick him out the window
My buddy, my buddy
I'll lay ya ass out, motherfucker, it's simple
Stay in your place I recommend
Or say hello to my little friend

Body is finished, maybe they can save the tooth
Call me Kiss or call me the Black Babe Ruth (Woo)
That many hits, fuck that, that many bricks (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
I don't give a fuck about pull out, cock back
Spin a motherfucker out, empty his chest
Leave your motherfucking whip a mess
All over the dashboard, in back seat, pieces of flesh
Send niggas to the grave with they face half-gone
Stomach ripped open, the beef back on
That nigga Sheek rude, I'll spit in your food
Tell the women in your family to suck my dick
No respect, fuck that, I'll murder you quick
Mad weapons in the trunk, bitch, take your pick
Stick a grenade up under your fender
Stick a pineapple bomb in ya blender, I don't care about you
You say fuck Sheek Louch? Well, fuck you too (Uh-huh)
Your father, your mother, the hole you came through
Niggas don't learn 'til they kerosene-ed out
Lighter to their face and spit gasoline out
You want me dead, I'm right here, do it, bitch
Make me bleed 'til I'm motherfucking fluidless
I ain't new at this and don't give a fuck about you
Sheek'll run up and smack the shit out you
I live this shit, it's never gon' stop
Open niggas' face with a octopus top
Face all ripped up, catch me on the block
Shells all loaded up, catch me with the Glock
Pussy motherfuckers don't want no beef
Strip niggas down to their platinum teeth (Uh)
Chase you in the house with the all-black heat
Leave you just boxers and slippers on your feet (Haha)
I talk reckless, I really want the coke and the money
But I'll settle for your necklace

Fuck being broke, I'm trying to cop a tan four

You really want beef? I'm busting the TEC
I'll hit you up in the park while you're doing your sets
It's D-Block (Yeah, yeah, y'all), can't get no streeter
Nigga, I'm nice with the hands, but I'm better with the heater
Old school style, stash haze in my sock

Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
(Ha-ha-ha) I owe you for this one

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)

[Bridge 1: Eminem]
You've been patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above

[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit—spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts to this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

[Bridge 2: 50 Cent]
If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50—man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the 6
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)

Cause they know we run trains (choo! choo!) all night
How could your gal leave me and be with you all night?
But it's all right, cause you know we don't kiss

I tried to told ya that most girls really freaks
And this is how they got to make they money every week

Real girls get down on the flo', on the flo'

So get out on the floor girl and get it how you live
And since you so hot, fuck it, show your pussy lips

[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm loving how you look in my eyes, swanging them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass, baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)
She got me feeling like, maybe she the wrong woman
Think I'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I'll have you doing what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong
Before I head home I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy

[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Lately she's been frustrated with the baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nutting more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call my by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surrounding me, hounding me, trying to be my ON-LY
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your HO-MIE

[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Yeah..
Don't know what fuck me up more: watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips, man
I sweet talk her if she like
'Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now, I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours (wooo!)
Big house, big Benz - girl it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
'Cause it means somebody's gon' hate you that never saw you
Come here, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you, and you can ride on
We can do it all tonight, we can have a ball tonight

[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Outro: Joe]
I wanna be your lover (oh yeah)
I wanna understand you, baby
I wanna be your lover
I wanna understand you, baby...

[Hook]
I've been travelin' for some time
With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine
On these long dark dusty roads
Lookin' there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy

[Verse 1]
I left out from mamma's with my thumb in the wind
The leaves on the ground, winter's comin again
Solid on the surface as I crumble within
But legends are made out of vulnerable men
So on the brink of death, I still manage livin' life
'Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice
I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price
No instructions when I was handed this device
But with what I did get, I was more than generous
Put others over self on several instances
But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness
And one way or another I shall have deliverance
So I say:

[Hook]
I've been travelin' for some time
With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine
On these long dark dusty roads
Lookin' there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy

[Verse 2]
Can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally?
Toast in the new south, this one is for history
Then I slipped fell and caused the number's injury
Called the same people and it's yo you just missed them B
This the formula, dammit Bubba you had it
Why'd you have to keep it Polo and New Balance?
Then they start to question whether you a true talent
Or just a redneck substance abuse addict
So then you hide away just to try to find your way
And now they back to callin' you two-hundred times a day
I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it
And ten million sold in the name of my deliverance

[Hook]
I've been travelin' for some time
With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine
On these long dark dusty roads
Lookin' there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy

[Verse 3]
Nothing could atone for the pain you've endured
The blood you shed is still stainin' your velour
You took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor
Only to discover that your savior's manure
Accepted me as kin, put before your younger brother
They put a lot on us hardly knowin' one another
I honestly can say that over time I've come to love you
Now we are brothers and together, no one can touch us
It haunts me with regret I never met your baby girl
She's an angel on your shoulder helpin' us to save the world
This musical marriage is no coincidence
On my mamma, Timmy, baby, we shall have deliverance
So we say:

[Hook]
I've been travelin' for some time
With my fishin pole and my bottle of shine
On these long dark dusty roads
Lookin there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
'Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
Ayy-ayy-ayy ayy-ayy-ayy ayy

Yeah yeah, DTP, how we do, call you, you can call me

[Chorus: J-Weav & Chingy]
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)

I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)

[Verse 1: Chingy]
It was weird how we met, huh?
She was with her mom at Bank America
With my son cashin' a check
So I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world of I, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, mama looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual, walks through the park (Park)
Candle light dinners by dark (Dark), I'm thinking smart (Smart)
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, crush and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up (brrring)
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever thoughts
So I zoomed off
Thinking 'bout her, my phone rang
It was her in the shower (What she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you
Then I say

[Verse 2: Chingy]
Yo, yo
The next day I'm with the fellas at the cage playin ball
Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin out, tryna dunk, tryna dribble
Break fast through the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over, I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying, Lil' Howard you weak'
But you know how that go
What I got they want, what I got I flaunt
Ever mess wit' it? Please don't
Told her I'm goin' home, she asked can she go too
I'm like, ""Yeah boo, I can't see me without you""
Got there, I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong set, I looked at her and said

[Chorus: J-Weav & Chingy]
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you wanna roll, just)
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one love away (and you was my lady)

[Verse 3: Chingy]
Girl recognize game before game recognize you
You dealin with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya
Some women like to play it foul
But them the kind I put in a place of a child
Don't worry be happy and smile

[Chorus: J-Weav & Chingy]
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my baby)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
I'm only one call away (and you was my lady)
Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me

Baby girl (I really like)
Desert Storm (yeah)

I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now
I wanna be more than a friend to you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90s in the 2 thou
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
Cuz the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vows
Maybe I speak in general now
But girl, (I'm gonna) do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about tan lines on the skin of you now?
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou
On Fifth Ave, shopping sprees and them dinners to chow
I ain't concerned with other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous, it's the principle now
I'm so into you

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

Come on ma
It's more than a flashing
I woulda traded it all in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashing
Just off the shore so you can hear when the water be splashing
The Drop top 3 in a quarter we dashing
Flawless diamonds in the water we flashing
The money we oughta be stashing
I make sure every quarter be cashed in

I can't really explain it
My friends be thinking I'm slipping
These girls be thinking I'm tripping
What kinda weed you be smoking
What typa drinks you be sipping
Sweet thing just to think of you dipping
Would have me with the blue so hard
You would think I was cripping
Now you relaxing in the Benz
Credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxing when you spends
But since you been asking about the friends
How'd you like it if both our names had Jackson on the ends

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you

I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak
Remind me of them trips to Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you it ain't because my whips is ruthless
So sit on chrome, dipped up deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary NVS dipped Jesus is
Other ballers look dumb when they press you
Five and sixes, you don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Being a player was becoming too stressful
But ever since, this superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart while the villa being painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it can feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, yeah

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it

I can't really explain it

See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'mma rip
But yo, what da hook gon' be? (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'mma rip

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
The sun'll come out... tomorrow
And I will never have to borrow
Got my first car when I turned sixteen
Only drove it home outta town limousines
Plus we was broke wit a deal but nobody could tell
So we did what we had to do for ""Country Grammar"" to sell
Haha, I stay on my own melodies
Plus I like my booties and my boobs like a capital letter 'B'
That's how it is, how it better be
I preferably rather have two or three girls in the bed wit' me
Close your ears, ma, you ain't heard nothing (what?)
I always pay ma, let a brother hold something
I'm basically coming from nothing to something
When I say nothing meaning pocket full of lint and buttons
(We all we got!) Used to be creative on Halloween (how you gon?)
Stop a hotter teen went from nada to a lot of things

[Hook: Murphy Lee & Jermaine Dupri]
But yo, what da hook gon' be? (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'mma rip
But yo, what da hook gon' be? (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'mma rip

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
People always saying man it must be nice
No hi, no nothing, not a simple ""how's life?""
Understand the money's good but I'm still from the hood
So don't be asking for no ""inch"" and be expecting the ""foot""
Unless you want a foot (whoo!)
I know a few crooks that can place you where you need to be put
And it might not cost me playa
Got a Benz pepper interior, paint salty playa
And we all push it, but me I push it real good
Brains blown out, chromed out, wheel real wood
Catch me on your local derrty
Or in the studio doing vocals derrty
I'm the same dude that came through wit my crew
Let the girls do me while you do you
And um, all I need is JD beat to be banging
And I'll come up wit' these verses that I'm usually slanging
I be ripping man

[Hook: Murphy Lee & Jermaine Dupri]
But yo, what da hook gon' be? (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'mma rip
But yo, what da hook gon' be? (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'mma rip

But yo, what da hook gon' be? (Uh oh!)
See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background

195,What More Can I Say,The Black Album,JAY-Z,2003-11-14,295160,45,"

[Produced by The Buchanans]

[Intro: Russell Crowe from Gladiator]
""Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained?""
""Is this not why you are here?""

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Turn the music up, turn me down
Guru, let's go get 'em again
This time it's for the money my nigga
Brooklyn, stand up

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
There's never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood or this pop, this hot or this strong
With so many different flows, this one's for this song
The next one I switch up, this one will get bit up
These fucks, too lazy to make up shit, they crazy
They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me
You know what? Soon they forget where they plucked
Their whole style from then try to reverse the outcome
I'm like, ""TAA!""
I'm not a biter, I'm a writer for myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse, I'm only biggin' up my brother
Biggin' up my borough, I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough, plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
I'm in, new sneakers, dual-seaters, few divas
What more can I tell you? Let me spell it for you:
W-I, double-L, I-E
Nobody truer than H-O-V
And I'm back for more, New York's ambassador
Prime Minister, back to finish my business up

[Chorus: Hum-V]
What more can I say?
What more can I do?
I gave this up to you
I know this much is true, true, true
My love

[Break: Jay-Z]
What more can I say to you? You heard it all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You already know what I'm about: flyin' birds down South
Movin' wet off the step, purple rain in a drought
Stuntin' on hoes, brushin' off my shirt
But ain't nothin' on my clothes 'cept my chain, my name
Young H-O, pitch the yay faithful
Even if they patrol, I make payroll
Benz paid for, friends they roll
Private jets down to Turks and Caicos
Cris' caseloads, I don't give a shit
Nigga, one life to live, I can't let a day go
By without me bein' fly, fresh to death
Head to toe 'til the day I rest
And I don't wear jerseys, I'm 30-plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans, nigga, button-ups
S. Dots on my feet make my cipher complete
What more can I say? Guru, play the beat!

[Break: Jay-Z (Hum-V)]
My nigga, hahahaha, woo!
We gon' let this ride into the hook
- I'ma snap my fingers on this one
What more can I say to you?
- Get my grown man on
LET'S GO!
(What more can I sayyyyyyyyyyy?)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now you know your ass is Willie when they got you in the mag
For like half a billy and your ass ain't lily-White
That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly, it's both!
I don't mean to boast, but damn, if I don't brag
Them crackers gon' act like I ain't on they ass
The Martha Stewart that's far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it
And no I'm not through with it
In fact, I'm just previewin' it
This ain't the show, I'm just EQin' it
One-two and I won't stop abusin' it
To groupie girls: stop false accusin' it
Back to the music - the Maybach roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem, Houston!
What up B, they can't shut up me
Shut down I, not even P.E., I'ma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly what these streets did to me
So picture me lettin' these clowns nitpick at me
Paint me like a pickany
I will literally kiss TT in the forehead
Tell her, ""Please forgive me,"" then squeeze into your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off, in fact
I got a joint that'll knock your points off
Young Hova the God, nigga, blast for me
I'm at the Trump International, ask for me
I ain't never scared, I'm everywhere, you ain't never there
And nigga, why would I ever care?
Pound for pound, I'm the best to ever come around here
Excludin' nobody, look what I embody:
The soul of a hustler, I really ran the street
A CEO's mind, that marketin' plan was me
And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated like, say, a Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat' a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culture
I'm supposed to be number one on everybody list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this man!

[Outro: Hum-V]
What more can I sayyyyyyyyyyy?

196,Never Enough,Encore (Deluxe Version),Eminem,2004-11-12,159786,60,"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy – you payin' attention, boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it, bag it or chop it
It'll get you high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

[Intro: Fat Joe]
Owwwwww! Yeah! My niggas, ahah
Throw your hands in the air right now, man!
Feel this shit right here, Scott Storch, nigga
Yeah Khaled, I see you nigga, show Big Pun love
Uh, yeah, uh, yo

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

[Verse 2: Remy Martin]
R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a V.I.P section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K Crip walkin' like, ""That's what's up!""
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

Young Buck
Dirty South, yeah

[Hook: Young Buck]
I hear him talking, but he 'bout to get that ass stomped
Watch, I get the club crunk; I'ma make 'em stomp
We ain't playin'; wanna front? Get that ass stomped
Do it like them Dirty South boys do and stomp
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm Cadillac'n through the hood, sitting on 24s
TVs playin, rims spinnin, blowin plenty dro
Don't have to mention when you pimpin', you get plenty hoes
It's all on you if you go'n' trick or you go'n' get ya dough
I know I got these haters mad, I can love that
When you got love for the streets, they give you love back
Look in my eyes; you can tell I ain't never scared
Poppin' them thangs; I'm rocking my chain anywhere
If you gon' represent your hood, what you waiting on?
Security better back up when they play this song
And we 'bout 50 strong; please, don't make us do you wrong
My clique is gorillas—they got they G-Units on
All of that mean muggin' really don't mean nothing
Come on and take it outside; let me see something
Wh-Wh-What now? Don't get b-b-bucked down
Stop all that hating, or this club gon' get sh-sh-shut down
Now, where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break em off

I hear him talking, but he 'bout to get that ass stomped
Watch, I get the club crunk; I'ma make 'em stomp

Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off

[Verse 2: The Game]
G-G-G-Unit! Coming straight outta Compton
Lace up my G-6s, and I'm A-Town-stomping
Got ten thousand cash in my pocket, let the pump in
'Cause Luda and Young Buck always getting me into something
Low-rider out front; I'm tryna get into something
Step on Banks' shoe one more time, and I'ma start bustin'
Rosegold in my grill; I got a dirty mouth
And a bitch with a fat ass from the Dirty-Dirty South
I wasn't trying to get the cover of the Double XL
Just trying to fuck Mÿa, 'cause Dre said sex sells
Don't be mad at the rocks in my fucking chain
Don't be mad 'cause your bitch chose Buck and Game
You see the logo tatted on my neck?
Same one I'm autographing on the chest
Put your bottles in the air for Yayo—he on house arrest
And on behalf of 50 Cent, this is G-Unit West
Now, stomp! G-G-G-G-Unit!
Now, stomp! G-G-G-G-Unit!

Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah! Motherfucker, I'm a monster in this game, similar to the Loch Ness
My rhymes are nappy rooted, some verses gotta process
The truth in this booth; ain't no doubts when I'm rapping
If I say it, I've either done it, or it's 'bout to happen
When I pull up in the Louis truck on 26s, people dumb out
If life's a crap game, I'm rolling 7s on the come-out
These rappers think I'm ign'ant, love saying my name
'Cause maintaining my fish tank and they house cost the same
Ask me, I say I made it, and it sure wasn't  luck
But 'cause hustlers relate to me and some are younger than Buck
You see, I'm married to my music but we got a prenup
So if that bitch don't act right, I'm still getting my cut
My deals never get screwed; my contracts practice abstinence
A master in this program, hazing these undergraduates
So pimpin', be easy; quit catching feelings
'Cause you worth a couple hundred grand, and I'm worth millions
Nobody thinking bout you; plus your beef ain't legit
So please, stay off the T-I-P of my di-ahhhhhh!

[Hook: Young Buck]
I hear him talking, but he 'bout to get that ass stomped
Watch, I get the club crunk; I'ma make 'em stomp
We ain't playin'; wanna front? Get that ass stomped
Do it like them Dirty South boys do and stomp
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off

Ow, baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door, but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B
I sing song, it go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
If I offend, I'm sorry, please, please, forgive
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see the show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh 'cause there's a puppet on my hand (Hahaha)

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say ""ass"" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, ""Get out, you bozo""
I need a new boyfriend, hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word ""pee-pee""
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me, please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Woo
Fuck is wrong with you?
Hah

[Intro: Dre]
This is, this is...
This is, this is...
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits
Next time if you talk (you talk)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits
Next time if you talk (you talk)
(And I know)

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Y'all niggas is pussy, punani, vagina
Your monologue's getting tired, now it's time to ride
Apprentice you're fired, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire; Harley dipped in octane
Let East Coast bang, let West Coast bang
And Rule gon' bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushing through in the sky blue
Back with the Gods, you now, preferably the four pound
Slugs flying at the speed of sound
Tryin to catch the ears of niggas that's running their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the running's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airing our prey out
Leaving 'em layed out, dead, in just a sport
'Cause we ain't playing up here in New York

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
And you can tell the way the homie spit
That nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
I got a hundred ways to make a grip
Yes, I'm from New York (New York)
And you can tell I get real ignorant
'Cause nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
(And this is how we do)

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Nigga, I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find God
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talking crazy how they're AK spit
But we done did some investigating, and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth, homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw, nigga, Joe gon' let 'em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringing the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to Lean Back
My nigga Dre said, ""grind, Cook""
Now we killing them hard
Niggas said I must've found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook Coke Crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the X is where the team be at, uhh

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
Ruff Ryde, and D-Block and shit
Nigga, fuck what you thought (you thought)
And you can't take shit for granted
'Cause life is too short (too short)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York
(HA-HAAAEEH! And this is how we do)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I swear it couldn't be sweeter, life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gon' die, you might get missed
For maybe two or three hours, 'til they light they spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken, and you know they say that you deserved it
Whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold the title, 'cause I'm in the hood
Like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doing shit for nothin', it's so spiteful, ha, I'm just like you
Word that niggas wanna murk you is in the air
A double shot of 'gac and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment
HA-HAAAEEH!

[Chorus/Outro: Ja Rule, Fat Joe, (Jadakiss) & All]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York, New York
And you can tell the way the homie spit
That nigga I'm from New York, New York
(I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York, New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits
Next time if you talk, you talk
(And this is how we do)

We getting loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire this

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
(Right?)
Nah, I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster than the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your hair
Yeah, I'm riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm 80's man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting wrong deals
I'm only 21, sitting on mills

[Hook: Lloyd Banks & 50 Cent]
We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire!

We getting loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire

(Ugh)
If you know anything about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I don't hit the first night, I ain't gon' call her
I'm trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't sparing a quarter<
So cut the games ma, let's go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass 'round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when I'm riding through the town
Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader

[Hook: Lloyd Banks & 50 Cent]
We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire!
Shorty take it off if it get too hot, up in this spot

We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves

(Jesus, walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)

[Verse 1]
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
I hope

[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus, walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus, walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
(Jesus, walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus, walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus, walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
So long, so long
(Jesus, walk with me)

[Verse 2]
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top (Uh-huh)

If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changin' grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (Oh) in my white tee (Oh)
Or on South Beach (Oh) in my wife beat'
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I...
Open up your mouth, your grill gleaming (Say what?)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (Chiefing)
I got a grill I call penny candy, you know what that mean?
It look like Now and Laters, gumdrops, jelly beans

So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood

I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks, let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is them 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouthpiece simply symbolize success (That's right)
I got the wristwear and neckwear that's captivating (What?)
But it's my smile that got these onlookers spectating (Hah)
My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad (Come on, man)
My teeth are mind-blowing, giving everybody chills

Where I got 'em, you can spot 'em on the top and the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
I ain't dissin' nobody, but let's bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white (That's right)
These hoes can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin' on some 4's, you can see my mouth jewelry
I got four different sets, it's a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same, got my name in the mold

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rollie on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes? See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide-wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear
Talkin' all that raspy shit, tryin' to ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it—take a second (Ding)
Matter-fact, you should take four, B
And think before you fuck with lil' Skateboard P

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rollie on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah, I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side—yeah, that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much, you thought I was a DJ
""Two, one, yep, three!""
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles
Waitin' on the Pizzle, the Dizzle, and the Chizzle
G's to the bizzack—now, ladies, here we gizzo!

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a bad boy, with a lot of hoes
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen, and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose!

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot

208,American Psycho II,D-12 World,D12,2004-01-01,224240,58,"

[Intro: B-Real]
Yeah, homie
I thought we told you, we been fucking loco
Cypress Hill, D12, bitch!

[Hook: B-Real]
I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain 'cause I'm a psycho

[Verse 1: Swift]
I'm a motherfucking omen, I bow down to no man
Split a nigga open, killing folks compulsive
A soldier with a motive, scrotum big as boulders
I hold 'em then unload on you, put it on a poster
So everyone can notice who was focused on us poking
They nose in our business, hoping that I don't come smoke 'em
No one knows my notions or emotions, I'm a vulture
You niggas close to croaking any moment and I know when
I could fuck the culture up, probably rap
A maniac with anxiety attacks, I don't wanna chat
Speak when you spoken to
And I don't have to read a fucking magazine or quotable
To notice what you hoes will do

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
We all soldiers, we move as a unit, we all roll up
And show up at your residence, light your front door up
Get scared, life ain't fair
And I'm prepared to blast you just as fast as Dre can say ""Hell yeah!""
So watch what you say 'cause it can happen either today or the next minute
I can draw the heater and spray and I'm dead serious
You could be dead period, end of story
I'm on your porch with a gun and your son, sipping a forty
Nobody can hold me, I does it all by my lonely
I stomp your head when you awake, you be looking like Gumby
Aftermath and Shady, bitch, you can read it and weep
You see my poster in the 'hood for ""the G of the Week""

[Hook: B-Real]
I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain 'cause I'm a psycho

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
They found Saddam, but they ain't gon' find me
I'll be under a tree in Buttfuck, Tennessee
And I don't know too much about my daddy
Except he spit in my face and fucked me in the fanny
I ain't a racist, I just hate whites
Fags and dykes, blacks and transvestites
Thirteen years old and joined a fucking gang
Hair under my ass cheeks feeling the fucking pain
Am I insane? Who really knows?
'Cause any second my temper can fucking blow
I get colder than December
Black the fuck out, tomorrow won't even remember
See Bizarre can show you what violence is all about
And this Dr. Dre beat done brought it the fuck out
Run in your house and put a gun in your mouth
And blow your brains the fuck out!

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I probably got a screw loose or two
Or maybe three or four of 'em
Some fell out and hit the floor
All I know is ever since my fucking head hit the snowbank
I been a little neanderthalish, no thanks to my man D'Angelo Bailey
But I just take it slow daily, my biggest dilemma's
Trying to figure whether to use the flat head or the Phillips
Or just go to the Home Depot and pick the new power drill up
It's been two hours and six days and I'm still up
I feel like I'm about to snap any minute
There's a new Tower Records about to stop and get a fill-up
Pick the new Cypress Hill up
And go find who did that shit to Xzibit
And go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss
And shatter his fucking lips with it

[Hook: B-Real]
I'm a little bit off the chain, call me insane
But the fact remains that I'm a psycho
Better get it through your brain
When you say my name
Never say it in vain 'cause I'm a psycho

Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range

Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming, ""My, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right

Take you to BeBe's and BCBG

The people to know or show you things to get into
I wanna be your lover and your confidant
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can get ya girl
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see ya in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And I bet she gon' put a hurt on 'em hard in the party
And you know you kill 'em in the club we go
You was born to be a pro, how you know who's taking photos
And I love you cause you freaky with the door closed
Drop it to the flo', let that go when you roll slow
And I love it when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me and have a brother going ""Oh-oh""
Girl I love how you roll me right

Bring 'em out, bring 'em out (Ayy, A-T-L!)

T-I-P, coming live from the VIP
Heard the nightlife lost life without me
Both the feds and the state wanna see bout me
The whole city got biz-zerk, he got three
That other nigga got a hit, but shawty, he not me (Naw)
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
The King back now, hoes don't even know how to act now
Hit the club, strippers getting naked 'fore I sat down
Still balling, money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road, doing shows, putting my mack down
Mississippi to Philly, Albuquerque to Chatt-Town

Once again, what other rap nigga hood-er than this?
I got rich, and I'm still on some hooligan shit
You be rapping 'bout blow—I was moving the shit
You talking 'bout shooting out, and I was doing the shit
If I hit you in the face, you gon' be suing and shit
And if I catch another case I know I'll truly be missed, so I'ma—
Keep a cool head, stay out of the news
And show these other rappers it's bedtime (Bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed-out, hard-top Carrera to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit, 'cause I get better with time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine?

Uh-y-yeah! Mic check, one-two, one-two
You wanna beef with the King? What is you' gon do?
Will you show up on the scene with two guns drew?
Or you and your friend and play a little two-on-two?
If you knew half of what I knew, then you'd be hitting the deck
I got a tool and a vest—I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucker nigga to flex
Show thim this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp, my nuts too large, and we way too fresh
Work well with nines, AK's, and Tecs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You wanna beef, nigga? Bring your best

I go by the name of Swizz Beatz, the Monster
I need y'all to rewind this and play this from the top!
Oww! (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Oww! (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Oww! (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
We on fire tonight! Come on! (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

213,Mockingbird,Encore (Deluxe Version),Eminem,2004-11-12,250760,74,"

[Intro]
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But ayy
What'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Post-Chorus]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)

214,Through The Wire,The College Dropout,Kanye West,2004-02-10,221226,69,"

[Music Video - Intro]
Last October Grammy-nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""
""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""
You can't be serious, man

I'm a Warrior
Aw man I never run never snitch

Before I shit on my family I lie in a ditch

I'll sacrifice it all if he has ta
React and think about it after (I am warrior!)

[Verse 1]
Uh, You heard right motherfucker
My grandmama daughter ain't raised no sucker
Heart full of pride and a head full of anger
Attitude of a winner infrared for the danger
Even the paranoia of a female'll change ya
Waking up every morning laying next to a stranger
I'm on the move, smooth, with one eye out for the snakes
Who can't stand hearing your name all throughout the states
Tune into BET and watching your video
Pretending to be your friends but the smart ones really know
So, if that's your man warn him
Cause there's enough bullets in here
To hit every NBA patch on him

Nigga ride 'til I die the song I sing
You ain't ready for the war I bring
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing
And I ain't ever scared I'm a warrior!

[Verse 2]
Goddamn ho here I go again
The Double L.O.Y.D
Here put on an I.V
Tryin ta try me
The new age I lead
The black C.I.G
Resides beside me
I''m smooth as an Isley
Sometimes I surprise me
Can't even ID
As low as my eyes be
I roll with the gangstas don't get foul with your mouth
The wrong punchline'll have niggas inside of your house
Nigga I'm doing good I made it out of the hood
I own Beverly Hills no more bottles or wood
That's a zipper that's sticky
California should whip me
I done made it this far can't be mad if they hit me (shhiit)

[Pre-Chorus]
Nigga ride 'til I die the song I sing
You ain't ready for the war I bring
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing
And I ain't ever scared I'm a warrior!

When I wake up in the mornin' love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
Then somethin' without warnin' love
Bears heavy on my mind
Let's get them dollars, let's get this money
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
I got my finger on the trigga', stayin' on the grind
And when I wake up in the mornin', I gots to hit a lick
Saw the two thousand and three Navi, on Sprees wit' a kit
Soon as my eyes see the sunshine
My thoughts is jukin' the block, and dodgin' the one time
Peep how we movin' the rocks and wit' pounds of dro before I double my shit
I can serve sixteen ounces for six and get back ninety-six
A killa' for the skrilla', nigga', best not be stalkin'
I gots to get them bigga', figga's, fuck what you talkin'
I represent them nigga's ballin' wit' jewelry full of zickels
Down to the nigga's chasin' million, their dreams servin' nickels
And I know, one day, I'm gon' come up
And when you see me, don't hate, that I rolled up
Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'cane
Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs
Gotta get that money man
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
It's lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that
I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks
And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs
I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto
Semi-auto and Marlboro's in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto
Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words
My nigga' flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds
I got the, mentality and the motive I'm on a mission
For the money, you can get it too, it's all about yo' ambition
Play yo' position, provide the plans, and follow procedures
In the six-hundred, blunted, wit' a pocket full of hundred's and Visa's
Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up
Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when the grip stack up
It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems
Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar
Gotta get that money man
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
Got love for the corporate playa's that's ballin' rollin' jags
Got love for the thug nigga's who get it on the ave.,
Love for those, who can make a mil' and sit back and laugh
And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass
Love for the single parents that's workin' through the struggle
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle
Love for those who gotta watch the hater's rollin' bubbles
Causin' trouble every time a young brotha' try to hustle
And if I can't, legally make or not
Then I gotta get, right back on the block
And if it no work we do a stick-up and whip-up a concoction
Might leave yo' face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money man
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day
When I wake up in the mornin' love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
Somethin' without warnin' love
Bears heavy on my mind

217,My Band,D-12 World,D12,2004-01-01,298773,70,"

[Intro: Eminem]
I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
‘Cause I'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my a capellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‘Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‘Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me, because these

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band
Baby, yeah

[Refrain: Eminem & Swifty McVay]
Alright, alright, alright, give me the mic, man
Okay, dawg, give—come on
Dude!
Give me this mic!
Ow, dude!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay & Kon Artis]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you? (Uh-huh)
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools? (God dang)
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van (Uh-huh) and he in a tour bus (Ha)
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift, ""Oh, I thought you were Kuniva"" (Come on!)
And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
‘Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh,) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back

[Verse 3: Kuniva, Kon Artis, & Eminem]
Look at Em's little punk ass, thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself, taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue?
No, I had an interview, not you two
You gon' be late for soundcheck! Man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up! And his always sound best
You know what, man? I'ma say somethin'
Ayo Em! You got somethin' to say? Man, nuttin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up
And you ain't even back me up and we supposed to be crew
Man, I was about to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever I swear, man!

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 4: Proof, Eminem, & Kon Artis]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo—) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, ""Hey, dude, I love your band!""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
Proof, carry my bag! Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group (Fuck D12)
Time for me to go solo and make some loot (Yeah)
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack (Take this)
""Lose Yourself"" video, I was in the back
""Superman"" video, uh, I was in the back (Hahaha)
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like, ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
(But what about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big-ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

[Bridge: Eminem & Bizarre]
Girl, why can't you see you're the only one for me?
And it just tears my ass apart
To know that you don't know my name

[Refrain: Bizarre]
Man, fuck this

[Chorus: Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (Haha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
‘Cause once I blow, I know that I'll be the man (Yeah)
All because I'm the new singer—

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & Bizarre]
My band, my band (Your band)
My band, my band (Our band, your band)
My band, my band (You man, you man)
My band, my band, my band (Roxanne Shanté, you lesbian)
Yeah, hey y'all, the hardest boy band in the world, D12!

[Outro: Eminem]
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, woah, woah, woah
Look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa
Where'd everybody go?

220,All Falls Down,The College Dropout,Kanye West,2004-02-10,223506,74,"

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

Ooh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah

[Hook - Avant]
I am, the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright
I'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand
I'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man
I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't keep my eyes off ya
I can tell why them other guys lost ya
Your kind's rarer than a flyin' saucer
And that's why I can offer, similarities in our characters
Haven't you heard the word 'round town? How I get down
They gon' whistle, everybody part is official
And that ass wit' you, got my dick as hard as a missile
Don't hop on top, cause I ride around with a pistol
If they pull us over, I'll be out of town with an issue
If you was mine, I'd introduce you to mama girl
You're stylin' in your boots and Gabbana, I'm so used to your Prada
I take trips cause out in Houston it's hotter
Throw in that Al Green and juice the Impala
Make my jewels and my collar
You had me feelin' like a fool when I hollered
Tryin' to squeeze in but you wouldn't bothered
Now I ain't neither, soon as I realized that I ain't need her
She in a rush to get close to me but I ain't eager
Shiit...

I am, the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright

[Verse 2]
Look I don't mean to bother you
But your sex appeal is remarkable
You make a G wanna walk around in park with you
There ain't no tellin' the kind of things I'mma start to do
If I get wrapped up on your ass too fast
I could tell you feel the same cause when I asked you laughed
So I'mma leave it at that, take a hint and put in my math
I imagine, you probably look twice as good in the bath
And I'm buggin' cause I can see you right in the hood when I pass
I'm never stable cause business is on my ass
But you could be the one that I visit before I dash
And I admit, I've been the type to hit and split
But you can't blame me for the females that I been gettin' with
Cause, most of these broads has had they eyes on my grit
To the eager shit, and learned to be satisfied with the dick
And, if you ain't worth it that's all you get
I ain't gon' blame you, I'm gon' blame all you tricks
Cause...

[Hook - Avant]
I am, the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright

I'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man
I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
It seems like your attitude, only appears when I'm mad at you
When several situations occur and that includes
When I'm gone too long, ridin' through them avenues
As soon as I get home there's rumors and scattered news
You know my fantasies, am I feelin' things or can this be
Your girlfriend tryin' to sandwich me
My heart's colder than sandwich meat
Cause I, come from the hood where the hammers be
I move fast with a switch pace
And pop a Listerine strip in, before you get all up in a bitch face
Movin' your body like this
Gon' make me blow like a bottle of Crist'
Man I don't know no one hotter than Twist
You got my temperature risin'
From your hips and your thighs and
And that glare in your eyes'll brighten up a horizon
It comes naturally, I don't bribe 'em
It's as easy as one, two, three and I slide in

[Hook - Avant]
I am, the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright

Catch me in the club with a double edge banger

Nah I know the promoters I'm in with the musket
Pound of that haze and a box of Dutches
High to the cottonmouth, paranoid
Make the wrong move, bitch, and your ass is out

You can come right to my crib and get it for shiz
You bein manslaughtered, right in front of my kids
A little blood get on my daughter, it's nothing, she'll live
Got cops shook to death of us...we don't like D's

You can run wit losers, or run wit winners that win

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I feel attention when I walk in the club
G-Unit to the socks, bitches all on a thug
Gimme a Henny on the rocks, and a bottle of bub
I don't need security, this for .4 Nickel enough
I came to ball wit y'all, buy up the bar and all
So bitches call ya hoes, and niggas call ya dogs
If you love ya wife keep her at home tonight
She might never come home again nigga, aight
Teeth, neck, wrists all lights my life's like
Riding in Cashville and running all stop lights
Homie is that real, I pray I keep living
My momma just had a dream of seeing me in prison
My daddy's a dope fiend, and I don't really miss him
Ain't seen him in 10 years and a nigga still living
The same old two step we move to a rhythm
50 holla get 'em Buck, you know I'm gonna get 'em, raaaaa!

I know I'm sinning but I'm winning at the same time
Took a couple shots from a nigga tryin' to take mine
I'm back on the block, wit a chopper and a Tech nine
Niggas shooting cops in the hood running stop signs
G-UNIT, The Gang! Bitches doing what the thugs do
GDs, Vice Lords, Crips and the Bloods too
Move let me come through
Ain't a pair of handcuffs, can hold me
I'm riding in the old school listening to some oldies
My gold keep shinin', them hoes keep crying
The handle of my .45 outlined in diamonds
Just left Cashville, bout to fly to Miami
Hopin' Yayo watchin' Eminem perform at the Grammys
The reason niggas like Eric Benet, probably can't stand me
Cause I know money will make Halle Berry come out them panties, bitch!
Y'all niggas in trouble they should of never let me in-in

Now where ya hood at, Buck If you want to

Who want beef, I ain't come for no name calling
Don't be mad cause we is and you ain't balling
Getting money is my motto for you broke folks
You spend ya whole life paying on ya car notes

[Intro]
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (Ah-ah), beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape""
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body

[Verse 3]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby
Fellas (What?) Fellas (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin', it's the season
Just go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Intro: Eminem]
So I changed, huh?
You got a phone
Pick it up, call me

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We were so young, so full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died, you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it
That you succame to yours and mine, I survived it
You ran the streets, I nine-to-fived it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
Then I blew up, to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe, I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it
You're cold, your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment
I can sense it and I don't like it

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal, but shit got worse
'Fore I came out, I woulda killed a nigga first
'Fore I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with, I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming out of the bar with her, stumbling, half-drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fuckin' other niggas
Must've hurt your pride or something
'Cause you woof off at the mouth to people
Like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show you that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your mans and lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell you the truth
Don't hate the game or the player, the one that's changing is you

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

[Verse 3: Proof & Eminem]
It gets lonely at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch, get to speaking all rude
Fools I used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping and poof, it just happen
But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance, since the ghetto, we been friends
Forever real intelligence, that's forever till the end
I peep the hatreds in your eyes and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
How come when you talk, it's with bitter and spite?
And how come it was my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you and play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more?
And you don't even call no more?
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine, we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

228,Get Em High,The College Dropout,Kanye West,2004-02-10,289493,57,"

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh-uh, I'm tryna catch the beat
Uh, I'm tryna to catch the beat
I'm tryna to catch the beat, uh-uh, uh-uh
I'm tryna to catch the beat

[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high, then smoke again
Keep 'em high (Now, now, now, now)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My flow is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
'Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I was a loser, I told her, ""Why don't you kill me?""
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks, you ain't gotta guess who's back, you see?
I'm so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't usually smoke, but pass the 'dro
And I won't give you that money that you askin' for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes
That's why we hear your music and fast forward
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'

[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high
And if you're losin' your high, then smoke again
Keep 'em high (Now, now, now, now, now, You've got mail)

[Verse 2: Kanye West, Sumeke Rainey & Talib Kweli]
Now who the hell is this
Emailing me at 11:26
Telling me that she thirty-six, twenty-six plus double-d?
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now she just lampin', chillin' on campus
Sent me a picture with her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late, mami
Your screen saver say Tweet, so you got to call me
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
You mean Talib? Lyrics stick to your rib (I mean)
That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib (I mean)
You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high (Yeah), ow

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli & Common]
I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin' up dimes
But never mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out
Well, okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
Her sister the bomb, but she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a OkayPlayer-hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or tryna get off cigarettes? (Keep 'em high)
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet (No)
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the Bubba Kush and her sister could get a hit of it, yeah (Yo, yo)

[Verse 4: Common]
Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype-filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote
Control, rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show called ""Soul Survivor""
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come you the hot garbage of
The year? It's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped-up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-
Red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a mad rapper
Just a emcee with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher, then

[Chorus: Kanye West & Common]
N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high (Yeah)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
Get 'em high (Mm-mm, uh-uh, uh)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
Keep 'em high (Keep 'em high, keep 'em high, uh-uh)
And if you're losin' your high, then smoke again
Keep 'em high

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm hard, Jehovah said I'm barred from the pearly gates
Fuck Him, I didn't wanna go to heaven anyway
But my momma got me on my knees with my hands gripped
Talkin' bout some ""praise the Lord"" shit
Hail Mary, fuck her, I never knew her
I'd probably screw her and dump her body in the sewer
Our father, my pops stuck up dope spots
Big, black, and mean, with the fifth by the Gabardine
What you expected from his next of kin, huh?
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin'
The lesson from the Smith & Wesson is depressin'
Niggas keep stressin', the same motherfuckin' question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, Ron G, stop the break

[Chorus: Stretch]
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave

You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Follow me, tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin' to kill me
Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points till they drill me
Keepin' it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin' steel
See niggas is false, sittin' in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they're petrified bitches
I'm tryin' to be strong, they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world till I'm gone
Bitches be warned - word is bond, you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Giuliani, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do'
With fo'-fo's, hahaha

You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave

I be that young, pretty fly, smooth, glorious kid
A Bad Boy, just like Notorious B.I.G
I'll Roc-a-Fella like Shawn Carter
With more game than Ron Harper
The bomb sparker rapper slash charm robber
While y'all be on the corners bummy and high
I be out buyin' the finest shit money can buy
You wish you was in a position that I'm in
Hot rhymin', diamonds shinin', autograph signin'
My lifestyle is far out
Every week, bring a different car out
I go to nightclubs and buy the bar out
Uh, 'cause I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
Every time I touch mics, you hear all the freaks scream

[Chorus: Stretch]
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave

[Intro: Ja Rule]
Word to mother, got my nigga Buck 3000 on the boards
Holla back
My nigga Terry, he gon' be the big boy
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ayo, ayo, Jody
Hey, you can tell somebody to go downstairs to the car and shit
Get that bottle of Voo out the back of the 'Bach for me, baby
I need to get right before I do this here
Uh-huh

[Chorus: Lloyd & Alexi]
(Why me and you) Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
(What we been through) It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feeling you) And I'm feeling we should both be free
(If we were through) Just imagine what life be without me

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Mami, I put my best foot forward, though it's kinda awkward
'Cause I'm pigeon-toed and bow-legged
But you ain't too proud to beg
First time we got alone, you gave me some head
And been calling me ever since to do it again
When we met you was a seven, just creeping to ten
And now your my lucky quarter
The days get shorter, nights get longer
You know when the weather is cold feelings grow stronger
What a performer, the pussy feel like walking pneumonia
Got me sniffling and sneezing, coughing and aching and shit
And I'm starting to think I'm falling in love with this bitch
I'm having dreams about her jeans and how they fit
In that ErvingGeoffrey baby tee
She's wearing my name already, so you know she's fucking me
I'm a G like that, but for you I fell backwards
The only question I ask myself is— Shit

[Chorus: Lloyd & Alexi]
(Why me and you) Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
(What we been through) It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feeling you) And I'm feeling we should both be free
(If we were through) Just imagine what life be without me

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Why me? Better yet why you and I?
Why I always pick the ones not in they right mind and crazy?
Singing ""Dangerously In Love""
This a dangerous broad I'm fuckin'
Like Al, it's the ""Scent of a Woman""
That got me playing hardball like Doc Gooden
Excuse my intruding, I don't mean to be rude
But our situation is kinda amusin'
'Cause we both like each other, but scared of each other
It's like we more than friends, but less than lovers
And my niggas can't tell us what we been doing is wrong
And your girls getting jealous 'cause we been getting along
Hold on, this is how it all begins
You call your friends, I'll call my friends, we'll all be friends
And hang out at the mansion in the Hamptons on weekends
Then it all ends, and the question is

[Chorus: Lloyd & Alexi]
(Why me and you) Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
(What we been through) It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feeling you) And I'm feeling we should both be free
(If we were through) Just imagine what life be without me

[Bridge: Lloyd]
Have you even been touched like I touch ya?
Been held like I hold ya?
Been loved like I love ya?
Be real, be real
Have you ever been seen like I see you?
Been heard how I hear you?
Been felt how I feel you?
Be real, be real

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Girl, you're my sunshine
But sometimes it gets a little cloudy don't it?
Them sunny days, I see the sunrise, and wish that it could hit ya
Face, it'd be great to get up every morning
To eggs and steak, but you can't relate
So we separated on good terms, no one's concerned
About who ya be fucking, and who ya fucked last
But when I see you, still the question I ask is

[Chorus: Lloyd & Alexi]
(Why me and you) Had to meet, talk, fuck and get caught up?
(What we been through) It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feeling you) And I'm feeling we should both be free
(If we were through) Just imagine what life be without me

Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit

Man I'm like a needle in a haystack, so face that
Go back to the drawing board, connect dots, but can't trace that
Matter fact, erase that, 'cause on this great track
Get your face slapped, and I'm straight so don't take that
Try somethin' different and shit, so listen and shit
Speakin' about what hip-hop is missin and shit
I'm about to fill a void, Ludacris born in Illinois
Raised in Atlanta, tote hammer since I was a little boy
Ain't nobody like me, so they wanna bite me
Fight me, step to me now but it ain't likely
People swear they sight me, just cause he's light-skinned
With braids in his hair don't mean that nigga looks like me
Trick get your mind right, livin' in the limelight
So picture what they'll do for my jimmy and a Klondike
Bar, bar, hardy-har
Tell yo' momma I'm a ghet-to su-per-star

Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit

Only standin' five eight but still a big shot, plus I got a big
Clean everyday, stay fresher than what's in a Ziploc
Tell your man to kick rocks, when I make my pitstops
I'm in, then it's hard to get me out like I'm a slip knot
Born to be a leader and not, no not a follower
Only hang with chicks that got mo' twists than Oliver
Not much of a hollerer, but I'd like to borrow her lips
Bringin out the best in me 'specially if she a swallower
Freaky deaky yellow man, and I'm sayin hello man
To all the lovely ladies that like to jiggle like Jello man
Bigger booty, small waist, put 'em in a small place
And if it ain't no ass where I'm at, then I'm in the wrong place
Bail like a bondsman, but keep 'em dancin'
Got pop potential, stay black like Bob Johnson
Who the hell is that in that fancy car?
Tell yo' momma I'm a ghet-to su-per-star

[Chorus]
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion

[Breakdown]
And jump down turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of hay
Oh lordy, pick a bale of cotton
Oh lordy, pick a bale of hay
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of hay
Oh lordy, pick a bale of cotton
Oh lordy, pick a bale of hay

[Verse 3]
Still working like a slave, learning tricks of the trade
In a ghetto state of mind, say I'm rich and I'm paid
Pickin' records like cotton in the thick of the day
Till I'm spoiled and I'm rotten in a sinister way
Life no different than those on minimum wage
More money but still locked in a similar cage
Either losers of tomorrow or we winners today
Digest that and there's really nothin' missin' to say but

[Chorus]
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion

232,Just a Moment (feat. Quan),Street's Disciple,Nas,2004-11-30,263453,44,"

[Produced by L.E.S]

[Verse 1: Quan]
Can we please have a moment of silence
That's for my niggas doing years in confinement
And for my soldiers that passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor
Symobolizing let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep til slugs kill us here
This for my dogs, stuck in the struggle trying to gain
Smoking trauma, sniffing Ra while selling cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowing how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Blooding and thugging, folking and loking
Criping and creeping, Latin and Kinging
Or just for poor righteous teaching

[Hook x2: Quan]
As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah and can we have another moment of silence
For brothers who died from Black-on-Black violence
From here to the Dark Continent where rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dying
And can we please pour some more liquors
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy my niggas
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhyming Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hoping that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishing I was there with you
Let's take 'em home

[Hook x2: Quan]
As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home

[Verse 3: Quan]
And can we please have a moment to mourn
For Pac, Biggie and Pun, 'cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah and Aaliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children
Who got raped or murdered or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Busting her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggas in the pen hoping rhymes'll get 'em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For every mother that held a son in the street bleeding
Crying a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speaking
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em

[Hook: Quan]
As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home

[Produced by Kanye West and Brian Miller]

[Intro: Cam'ron & Kanye West]
Ugh, Killa!
Baby!
Kanye, this that 1970s Heron flow, huh?
Yeah, let's speed it up
Ugh, I'm back in, ugh, ugh
They don't know we finna kill the game this year
Killa! 'Ye! C'mon!

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Ayo, street mergers, I legislated; the nerve, I never hated
On murders, premeditated—absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray, hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki; we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck your ace, take your girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa, so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa 'cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking, kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the juxes
You would've thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now, the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior; Star-Spangled Banner
Car game bananas, mob manning tanners
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers, he's back

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)
Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina; put your legs behind your head
Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mines are dead, doggy
Fox, minks, gators, that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's Pet Sematary
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo, I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Y'all don't even know the name of my flip
It was ""Touch Me, Tease Me"" when Case was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get:
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris', oww!

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)
Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Ugh, Killa, yo, yo, ayo—
You dealing with some sure shit, my bitches pure thick
Play razor tag, slice your face, you're it!
It's I who come by, drive-thru
Gator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky-blue
Look at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''
I approached her—""Hi, boo, how you?
Pony skin Louie? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good, ma—I fly too""
Now, a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking the weight
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes
Kill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just your picture, though; you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing; you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the four
I hope a nigga heard when I said ""I told you so""
Ugh, Killa!

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh), the game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh), they coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh), money back on my mind (No no)
Ye and Killa Cam, the world is mine (Oooh)

[Outro: Cam'ron]
Mine! Killa!
You already know Harlem
Whole Midwest, Detroit, Naptown, St. Louis
Chicago, of course
Westside, holla at me
Southside, wild hundreds
You know what it is, Ohio
Columbus, holla at your boy
You know what else I do:
Dayton, Youngstown, Cleveland, Cincinnati

You can look me in my eyes, see I'm ready for whatever
Anythang don't kill me, make me better
I ain't dead nigga, you can take the fame and the chedda
And the game, any deal, I'm still a go-getter
Take my freedom for the moment but it ain't fo-ever
I got the spirit of a god, heart of a dope dealer
I'm a king, seen hangin' with some cold killas
I ain't never back down or ran from no nigga
I ain't sat down yet, pimp, standin' gorilla
Even if I'mma all alone or standin' with four niggas
Tell'em jump, pimpin' it don't get no realer
5'9"" with the soul of a 6'4"" nigga
I separated the fakes, paralized from the waist down
From the real stand up guys of the A-Town
Can't even look me in my eyes, put yo face down
I'm outta jail nigga, whachu gotta say now?

Motivation
Niggas fakin' only gonna inspire (Motivation)
All yo hatin' in fuel to my fire (It's motivation)

To be locked in a box niggas happy to see
Put anybody on top, any rapper but T-
I-P, but back to reality, G-O-D still carrying me, nigga I run this
Spread yo rumours, kick all yo lil' dumb shit
Tell lies, laugh 'bout the time that I'm gon get
If it make you feel better, picture me over and done with
Punk bitch, come with all the gossip you can come with
Small thang to a giant, I can overcome this
Jail, I don' done this, rap I'm just havin' fun with
I could be a local joker, never have one hit
Nigga, ""New Finish"" alone'll get me dumb rich
While these rappers sellin' records gettin' pennies
If Grand Hustle sell any, I'mma get plenty
If God with me, who could be against me sucka?
Can't make me suffer, just make me tougher

[Intro: 2Pac]
Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

[Chorus: Elton John and 2Pac]
Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‘Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel

[Chorus: Elton John]
Those who wish to follow me
(Ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel

[Chorus: Elton John]
Those who wish to follow me
(Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Outro: 2Pac]
Lord, can you hear me speak?
To pay the price of bein' hellbound

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yeah! That all mighty amazin', ill, highly contagious
Kamikaze South splash like it shot from a gauge
Until your body sound clash
Head of the Class, Magna Cum Laude
Beats bring the beast out me, flagrant foul rowdy
Reed pipe but deep tight, disposition keep on flippin'
Keep 'em playin' they position
Keep makin' the people listen what I spin
Put 'em out on a limb
Got tears, got blood, got sweat leakin' out of the pen
Y'all fake niggas not settin' a trend
We never listen to them
It's like tryin' to take a piss in the wind
My home team doin' visitors in, yo, don't test 'em
They all standin' close to the edge, so don't stress 'em
Now, who the type built to last? It's no question
The master, villain in black wit' no Stetson
My sound hittin' you hard from every direction
Your head and shoulder area, your midsection, dawg!

[Hook]
When the saint on the ground with his nine on line
With the niggers who grind with King Kong hittin' Thailand
Give it here, and don’t say nuthin'
Just give it here, give it here and don’t say nuthin'
When the team on the set with the guns gone clap
Gettin' down on everything, hmmm, cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin
Just give it here, give it here and don't say nuthin

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yeah, Illadel! Home of the original gun-clappers
Out on the wrong corner, your shit'll get spun backwards
You got the fool wantin' the rules, enter at risk
Or your own nana'll keep a gat under the mattress
Shorties runnin' reckless from Philly to Texas
Surprisin' what niggas willin' to do to get a necklace
Some emotions felt better left unexpressed at times
Niggas' crime record longer than a guest list
Yes, I done seen things you wouldn't believe
Seen people reach levels thought they'd never achieve
Silhouettes waitin' in the wings ready to D
Thirsty sheists who need at least a buck to breathe
C'mon! Stick up kids, they be out to tax
Most times, they be stickin' you without the gats
I'll still be on the grind when it all collapse
And if it’s mine, word is bond, I'mma take it right back, nigga

[Hook]
When the saint on the ground with his nine on line
With the niggers who grind with King Kong hittin' Thailand
Give it here. and don’t say nuthin'
Just give it here, give it here and don’t say nuthin'

Gettin' down on everything, hmmm, cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin
Just give it here, give it here and don't say nuthin

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Yeah, it ain't nothin like the rush I get in front of the band
On stage, wit' the planet in the palm of my hand
When a brother transform from anonymous man
To the force, crush whoever might of thought I was playin'
I'mma flame some sinister shit, the code twister
Slang thicker than Big Boi baby mom’s sister
Pain beyond measure, relaxed under pressure
You see the master piece, but to me it's unperfected
Give it here, Geffen Records, I'm off the handle
Cut the check, and yo, it better be as heavy as anvil
Next joint comin', all bets is canceled
Nigga Black Ink, Grand Wizzard, Gee Financial
We finna have the whole industry at a standstill
See me put the system on lock like Camp Hill
So get wit' them endorsements, and call reinforcements
'Cause my clique come a full sizable portion

[Hook]
When the saint on the ground with his nine on line
With the niggers who grind with King Kong hittin' Thailand
Give it here. and don’t say nuthin'
Just give it here, give it here and don’t say nuthin'

Get Right for the Summer workout tape

Man, at least a dude with a car
So, first of all, we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass

[Verse 1]
1, and 2, and 3, and 4, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick

Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me

Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

Oh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette

You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas

We let the doves do it for us, we don't cry tears (That's right)
Real niggas don't budge
When Mel Man got his time, he shot birds at the judge (Yeah)
I'm knee-deep in the game
So when it's time to re-up, I'm knee deep in the caine (Damn)
Real talk, look, I'm tellin' you, mayne (Tellin' you, mayne)
If you get jammed up, don't mention my name (Nah)
Forgive me, Lord, I know I ain't livin' right

And this is e'ryday, it never gets old
Thought I was a juvenile, stuck to the G-code (Chea)

Gotta watch ya every move 'cause them eyes be on you
Gotta drive real cool when them pies be on you
Just because we stack paper and we ball outrageous
Them alphabet boys got us under surveillance (Ay)
Like animals, they lock us in cages
The same nigga that's a star when you put him on stages
I ain't cheat, played the hand I was dealt
Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself (Let's get it)
No nuts, no glory (No glory)
My biography, you damn right, the true story
Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die (Ay)

[Bridge: Akon]
Cause if you lookin' for me
You can find me on the block disobeyin' the law
A real G, thoroughbred from the streets
Pants saggin' with my gun in my drawers
Just keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now, ay

[Intro]
Yeah, Shady, Aftermath, G-Unit
Damn baby all I need is a lil' bit
A lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Get it crackin' in the club when you hear the shit
Drop it like it's hot, get to workin' that back
Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round

[Verse 1]
I step up in the club I'm like ""Who you wit?""
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin' to beef, I'm tryin' to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'mma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'mma get in shorty ear and I'mma let her know

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit

[Verse 2]
This is 50, comin' out your stereo
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh man""
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit

[Bridge]
Baby you got me feelin' right, you heard me?
My momma gone you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin' I'm tryin' to fuck tonight, you heard me?
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon, ha ha

All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit

241,"Lean Back (feat. Lil Jon, Eminem, Mase & Remy Martin) - Remix",All Or Nothing,Fat Joe,2005-06-14,290266,62,"

[Intro: Lil Jon]
Stop! It's the motherfucking remix!

[Intro: Mase & (Lil Jon)]
Uhh! Yeah, Harlem is back (TS)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Fo' real)
I heard Harlem is back (You know we had to do the remix)
Who in the world want a problem with that?
(Yeah! Eminem nigga!)
Uhh! Yeah, Harlem is back (Lil Jon nigga!)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Mason Betha!)
I heard Harlem is back (Fat Joe!)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back, come on

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
You know it's deja vu, and the day y'all do
It'll be the day y'all bleed
Wrist minus eighty degrees
King of Harlem, ain't nobody made me leave
Who else could take five years off?
Cold turkey? Come back and fly lears off
Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff
If haters wanna hate, then it's their loss
Come up in the Rucker with all my Jake's on
Car grills so big you can cook a steak on
People hear Ma$e call them wanna get their mase on
You hot 16, I'm a very great song
They beating on the DJ booth 'fore the Ma$e song
You play Clark Kent, you better have your cape on
Plenty homes Mansion many rooms
My necklace, 2Xs and three Bentley bulls
Lean back, lean back, lean back
'Cause he's back, come on
Lean back, lean back, lean back
'Cause he's back, come on

[Interlude 1: Lil Jon]
Eminem, what's up! Hey!

[Verse 2: Eminem & Lil Jon]
You don't want no problems with Harlem
You don't want no problems with the boogie-down Bronxster
You don't want no drama with the blonde bomber
Original Don Dada of the blonde bottle
The model from White America
Then Joe, the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Ma$e back to re-per-e-sent
E-ver-y-thing else in between
Including the percentages of the rest we don't
The best from each coast, the midwest to the dirty-dirty
Even further to Miami, all the way back to Californ-i-a
It'd probably be best right now if I warn Dre (Yo Dre)
To get on the horn and tell I'm about the storm coming all our way
So tell a pal, grab a gal right now, get on the floor while I wait
Shake that ass a little more my way, but baby, I don't dance
Not that I can't, there's a pistol in my pants, come on

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back, come on
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back, come on

[Verse 3: Remy Ma]
Ayo, Remy pop but I'm hot like an out of state spot
And anybody think I'm not, you're found in a vacant lot
You don't really wanna run with the one chick
Who smoke dutchess for lunches, da castle hill, I ain't luncheon
Now, it's on it for the Terror Squad
Pun, Prospect, Sunshine, Geddy, Crack and Remy Ma
It's not a chick in the game want it
My 16 so mean, put 20 G's and my chain on it
Quick to flip, I ain't the average chick
I'm packin' a MAC in the back of the forty-five past six
And you know, I got enough goons to crush a country
Any dude disrespectin' Pun, he better play then run C
Bring your mans and then we handle him
Then we gon' Timbaland trample 'em, then we pull the cans in them
Lean back 'cause I ain't never worry
See, I'm forever glory, smackin' up any chick in my territory

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Come on

[Verse 4: Fat Joe & Lil Jon]
No Judas or cowardice or Cain's brother
Abel is able to stop me, nigga, not me!
Got the streets asking ""Damn, who can top P?""
Summer Jam? Killed it, man, I did it all with one beat
I guess I'm bi-coastal now
Took a down south brother to bring your boy out (What?!)
As the wheel keeps spinning
I can hear niggas thinking, ""Crack got one hit, then he out""
Nope! Joey bring them semi's out
Force you and yours to pour a little Henny out
So much rappers acting in the game
I had to tell them put the mic away and run and get your Emmy's out (Uh)
Lean back, motherfuckers (Yeah)
This here's a three-peat, we back at the Rucker
It's Cook Coke Crack, preach it to ya, brother
The Mike Moore rap and preach you motherfuckers

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Come on

[Outro: Lil Jon]
Said my niggas don't dance we just pull out our gats
And say blow your back away, fuck nigga
Lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull out our gats
And say blow your back away, bitch nigga
Lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
Hey!

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see me gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
I'm ridin' with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up!""
Next to the PlayStation controller
It's a full clip in my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma (Woo!)
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin' oak (Oak)
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow (Slow)
Twin's steady twistin' like, ""Hit this though!""
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
The windows down, got to stop pollution
CD change, niggas like, ""Who is that producin'?""
That's the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston but I still ain't losin'

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I've been drinkin' and smokin'
Holy shit, cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home 'fore the po-po's scope this
Big old Excurs' just swervin', all up in the curb and
Nigga be sippin' on the Hennessy and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt and roll another one up
We livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' 'bout the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me, on the lowkey
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, ""Fuck 'em all""
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, and get it poppin', dawg
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Now would you think it's so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rearview and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin'
Keep steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags (Tags)
Pull me over, try to check my slab (Slab)
The glove compartment, gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Jammin' number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, tell 'em, ""We hate you""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home
And it's on

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

Fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh

Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna stunt

I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Tre pound on my hip, Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good, 'cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie-ass bitches, you can kiss my ass

You're now rockin' with the best
Four pound on my hip, gold chain on my chest (ahh!)

It took two months but 50 got it done
Signed with G-Unit, had niggas like, ""Huh?""
Don't try to front, I'll leave your ass slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk get your fuckin' head lumped
50 got a, gun! Ready? Here it come
Got a sick ven-detta to get this, cheddar
Meet my Be-retta, the drama setter
Sip Ama-retta, my flow sounds better

Let me hear you holla ""Goon Sqwad!"" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla ""Runyon Ave!"" in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me

Fuck that, Blood Blood, I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit
Trick Trick, quick, come pick me up
Bring them guns, come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin' some junk ‘cause he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up
‘Cause uh, somethin' smells a lil fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
So homie, come get me
Wonder Boys, what up though, I see you

Homie, it's been a long time comin' and I'm straight with that
Marshall done called me to fifty-four and so I laced the track
This li'l beat that you hear him bangin'? He produced it himself
My bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Sqwad and gangsta
Been bangin' the underground since ninety-five with bankers
Elected to be the villain and certified as a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous evil deeds of the D? Yeah, that was me
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Those accusations of violence, you know you done heard of that
Just a quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
Wonder Boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house

[Chorus: Eminem & Trick Trick]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And uh, welcome to Detroit city

And yo Em, you ever need one of these weapons, come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie, I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been woopin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see, they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep frontin'
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it being my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can feel me
Only speakin' on what I know so that the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed the winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fuck with us

[Chorus: Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And uh, welcome to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go

[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Verse: Jay-Z]
Dear Summer, I know you gon' miss me
For we been together like Nike Airs and crisp tees
S dots with Polo fleeces
Purple label shit with the logo secret
Gimme couple years, shit I might just sneak in
A couple words and like Peaches & Herb
We'll be reunited and it feels so hood
Have the whole world saying ""How you still so good?""
Well I do this in my slumber, Summer
I ain't none of these half-assed newcomers
You know how I do, Summer
I drop heat, when you bring the sun up
The combo make niggas act up, I pick the gun up
Niggas back up; they know I'm not no fronter
I don't talk SHIT, I just flip it Un ya
Sorry Lance, I'm just trying to advance my quotes
I ain't making you the butt of my jokes
But let's not stray from what I came to say
To my beloved, think we need some time away
They say if you love it, you should let it out its cage
And fuck it, if it comes back, you know it's there to stay
It's tugging, at my heart, but this time apart is needed
From the public, who should've gave me the Pulitz'
Instead gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging 'til the casket dips
But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird... some queer, I still want them to share
In all the success I received, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em but they don't love me
They like the drunk uncle in your family
You know they lame, you feel ashamed
But you love em the same
It's like when niggas make subliminal records
If it ain't directed directly at me, I don't respect it
You don't really want it with Hov, for the record
I put a couple careers on hold, you could be next, kid
Keep entering the danger zone
You gon' make that boy Hov put your name in a song
If you that hungry for fame, motherfucker, c'mon
Say when, take ten paces and spin
But on another note, 'bout to take another vacay
On another boat, goddamn, a motherfucker wrote
His way out the hood, and I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could
Try and play like he Suge, then I gotta play like Dutch Schultz
You pass the dutchie, I blast you, trust me
Niggas can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood, you lucky, I got a good groove
And I ain't trying to fuck my thing up
But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Non-Pulp Fiction, Colt four-fifth and
Young niggas that blast for me, no religion

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Listen here, Summer, baby
I just believe it's the right thing to do
I got a brand new bitch, Corporate America
She showing me a lot of action right now
And I know you put me on my feet and all, but
I mean, it's time for me to grow
You gotta let me go baby, you gotta let me go

[Outro: Jay-Z]
I'm done for now, so one for now
Possibly forever, we had fun together
But like all good things, we must come to an end
Please show the same love to my friends
Dear Summer

[Chorus]
Still tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Now look who creepin', look who crawlin', still ballin' in the mix
It's that six-six, long dick, slim nigga stickin' your chick
Pullin' tricks, lookin' slick at all times when I'm flippin'
Barre sippin', car dippin', Grant wood grain grippin'
Still tippin' on fo' fo's (Still tippin' on fo' fo's)
Wrapped in fo' vogues (Wrapped in fo' vogues)
Pimpin' fo' hoes (Pimpin' fo' hoes)
And I'm packin' fo' fo's (And I'm packin' fo' fo's)
Blowin' on that indo, GameCube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand me 'cause I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit' a big Glock nine handy
Pieced up, creased up, stayin' dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm ridin' Sprewells slidin' like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the north
Ain't shit changed I still represent SwishaHouse (Ha!)

[Chorus]
Still tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues

[Verse 2: Mike Jones]
Fo' fo's I'm tippin', wood grain I'm grippin'
Catch me lane switchin' with the paint drippin'
Turn your neck and your dame missin'
Me and Slim we ain't trippin', I'm figure flippin' and syrup sippin'
Like do or die, I'm po' pimpin'
Car stop, rims keep spinnin'
I'm flippin' drop with invisible tops
Hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shakin' the block with four eighteens
Candy green with eleven screens
My gasoline always supreme
Got dirt on the brim with a pint of lean
It takes grindin' to be a king, it takes grindin' to be a king
First Round Draft Picks comin', Who is Mike Jones comin'
Slab shinin' with the grill and woman
Slab shinin' with the grill and woman
I'm Mike Jones, (Who?) Mike Jones
The one and only, you can't clone me
Got a lot of haters and a lot of homies, some friends and some phony

[Bridge: Mike Jones]
Back then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me
Back then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me
Back then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me (I said!)
Back then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me

Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
What it do? It's Paul Wall, I'm the People's Champ
My chain light up like a lamp 'cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawlin' similar to an ant, 'cause I'm low to the Earth
People's feelings get hurt, when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighty fo's pokin' out, at the club I'm showin' out
I'm a player, ain't no doubt, hoes want to know what I'm 'bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth, princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range, drippin' stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name, it's still the same, SwishaHouse or SwishaBlast
Mike Jones, he runnin' the game and Magnificent 'bout his cash
Michael Watts, he made me hot, hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot, he wrote a check and bought a drop
I got the internet goin' nuts but T. Farris got my back, so now I'm holdin' my nuts
It's Paul Wall baby, what you know 'bout me?
I'm on that five nine Southlea, baby, holler at me

[Chorus]
Still tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues

247,I Know You Don't Love Me,Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon,Tony Yayo,2005-01-01,235173,43,"

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
You ain't the same when Jay-Z's around
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
You scream and holler when Eminem's in town
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
Snoop put me up on how the hoes get down
I know you like Nelly, like Kelly, Ludacris
Try to run game on me, you punk bitch, I know you don't love me

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Gators and ostrich, you know the apparel
You could see my outfit on the Discovery Channel
I'm a stunner, my bitches trained like robots
They sniff coke, deep throat and they hold out Glocks
It's the brick-copper, the ounce chopper
645 NASCAR driver that's known to spit lava
I'm in Cancun with a model in the bedroom
Her pussy tight like an airplane bathroom
Talk out your mouthpiece, baby pa
Or the baby AR will make it hot like South Beach
I move like Bin Laden armed with them hammers
In that new Jag wagon or James Bond Vanquish
Medina all red, mira, give me head
Bad bitch, look like Eva Mendes
I'm a gangsta, general, comrade nigga
Drug money, blood money in a brown bag, nigga

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
You ain't the same whenever Banks around
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
You scream and holler whenever Usher's in town
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
See, Dre put me up on how the hoes get down
I know you like Buck and that Dirty South shit
Try to run game on me you punk bitch, I know you don't love me

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I'm in the candy-painted Range, Cardier frames
Six by nines playing, so I can hear everything
Heavy on the gas homie, hogging up two lanes
The navigation got me to where I'm gon' be staying
A trunk full of something that can get a nigga life
So my seatbelt's on and I'm stopping at the lights
I done been to Queens before, but not behind the wheel
I'm a country nigga, ain't this many buildings where I live
But the business gotta be handled, so where this coward at?
We leave a couple niggas laying, bet them bitches holla back
Ever since Yayo been home it's been on
Smacking niggas up, employees is getting sent home
On this battlefield, you know, it's kill or be killed
Leavin' niggas with bullet holes and hospital bills
This is how it is homie, La Cosa Nostra
I won't stop 'til I'm on a ""Wanted"" poster, motherfuckers

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
You ain't the same when Lil' Jon's around
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
You scream and holler when Slim Thug's in town
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
Yeah, Em put me up on how the hoes get down
I ain't got time for a groupie-ass bitch
Try to run game and they ain't about shit, I know you don't love me

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
You should thank the Lord if the ray gon' getcha
Cause the sawed-off'll microwave a nigga like Adolf Hitler
Fuck pressure, I enter the ring calm
I'm nicer than them Japanese niggas in ping-pong
Look at my ring, don, at least a hundred K worth of bling on
Smoking the same buddha as the courtroom shooter
I got the mind of a genius, the rag-white Jag
Backhand like Venus', jab like Zab
And your bitch, I'm making her knees knock in the lab
Nut on her and send her to the weed spot in the cab
And I don't hate all music, I just hate y'alls
And I hear you when you whisper, got the ear of Ray Charles
I'm ahead of my class, fucker
And I only serve a bitch once, so they treat my dick like the Last Supper
Niggas calling out my name in vain
Must want a jab to the jaw to be they claim to fame

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
You ain't the same whenever Banks around
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
You scream and holler whenever Usher's in town
I know you don't love me (I know you don't love me)
See, Dre put me up on how the hoes get down
I know you like Buck and that Dirty South shit
Try to run game on me, you punk bitch, I know you don't love me

[Produced By: Cool & Dre]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Verse 2: The Game]
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

Yeah! For the first time, it's going down, history baby
New Three 6 Mafia, featuring 8Ball & MJG, Young Buck
It's a Tennessee thing

'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
They call me the Juice and you know I'ma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the mayne
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part and be buying the bar

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga your green gon' get lit up
You leave your drank around me
Believe your drank gon' get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad, she gon' get stuck
These niggas is spies
We live them lives and keep them eyes tight
Riding 'round what they like
Make a couple nuns a couple of dykes
So purple, purple, purple, and swallow it down
With the yurple, yurple, yurple, it's going down

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Puff, puff, pass, nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high, nigga, smoke us one
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gon' come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my Gs
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window when I roll the indo
Know they mad cause I'm rolling Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own
Cause them niggas there let me smoke for free

[Verse 4: Crunchy Black]
What's up Mary? How you doing? Mary Jane stalking me
Since I have met you, girl, you ruled my brain
You stole my heart, right from the start
So I broke you down, let momma put you in the 'gar

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
'Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

[Verse 5: 8Ball]
Premro full of that dro
Leave the club full of Rose' Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's the epitome of the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

[Verse 6: MJG]
MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga running back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at?
Cutting up a cigarillo like a lumber jack
In the morning, when I need this
And breath again a whole lot of weed
But I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less then the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, 8Ball and MJG
And Young Buck, we don't give a fuck
We must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy
Nigga got a lil' hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out your mouth
We'll shoot it right down on your dress

Man
Motherfuckers just follow a nigga around, dude
That's real
Some shit though, fuck these feds
Redneck, racist motherfuckers, man!

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna run (run) no more, but I know that if I stop
I'll be another nigga headed to heaven, hanging with 'Pac
These motherfuckers look at me like I'm a slanger
Makin threats to my family, dawg I'm in danger
Who do you call when these agents want you dead
And they hit these penitentiaries and niggas make a pledge
So I dip and duck the feds, all my homies stuck out on indictments
Caught up on the phone, talking prices (Hello?)
25-to-life's the mandatory minimal
My whole community gets treated like they criminals
Prior convictions getting motherfuckers hung
Got a C.I. on the inside and everybody's sung
Mothers and fathers separated from they sons
Households are broken, you couldn't hold your tongue
If it's yours, say it's yours, take the case, do your time
When you was out here getting money from it everything was fine
Now you crying in your jail cell, stressing on the case
And the D.A. is at a nigga every other day
I can see it in your face, in the middle of your soul
You in question of your manhood homey (Keep the code)

[Chorus]
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
We don't talk to police
We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
We rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
Said we don't talk to police
We ain't trustin' in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
Yeah we rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

[Verse 2]
See I be on some street shit, don't talk to police
I won't accept a visit from agents who wanna see
If I got shit to say about a nigga case
I'm a motherfucking nigga through and through, iron gate
Know a nigga caught a case and he took his 25
Sat it out on appeal, and gave him back that time
A soldier in his mind and his actions said the same
Told a cracker tell your mammy suck his dick cuz he with James
Ain't no motherfucking game, we been living this for real
When the government is working, real niggas never squeal
Right here the truth revealed, Troy you a mouse
Yeah you rapping but the homey Lil Pots can't get out
Niggas they hit the pen, they get charged, then get out
On a Rule 35, he informing for the cops
You can hear it in his voice, I done listened to the tapes
Now you showing up in court, testifying for the state

[Chorus]
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
We don't talk to police
We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets, we do battle in the hood
We rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
Said we don't talk to police
We ain't trustin' in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
Yeah we rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

[Verse 3]
I'm knowing all the scams, all the tricks to the trade
Know a nigga trying to get clean, and you get in the way
Know a nigga tryin to get green, and you stick out the bait
Cause a nigga like a dopefiend, can't rehabilitate
Still we stickin' to the G Code, we playing by the rules
We don't fuck around with new niggas, cause new niggas is fools
We don't photograph the homies, that'll catch a nigga up
On a picture you a victim, bottom line nigga fucked
Only connect the real, staying down with the true
I got love for you Ant, you a real nigga Spook
My nigga Spoonie Gee, I can only name a few
But there's a thousand motherfuckers in the pen bulletproof
So this one here's for you, I'm a rep it 'til I die
Fuck a 5-K-1, check his P-S-I
Send his ass to the top if he say he sit at home
He a motherfucking snitch, snitching niggas need this song

[Chorus]
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
We don't talk to police
We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
We rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood
We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
Said we don't talk to police
We ain't trustin' in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
Yeah we rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

[Outro]

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G. (Faith Evans)]
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin' (Oooooh)
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin' (Ooh ooh oooooh)
1970 somthin'

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G. (Faith Evans)]
1970 somethin'
Nigga I don't sweat the date, my moms is late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world, the fly girl (Yeah)
Tanqueray or Hennessy until I called Earl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck (Hey yeah)
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit (Ooh)
New York, New York ready for the likes of this
Uh, then came the worst date, May, 21st
2:19 is when my mama water burst
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical chord's wrapped around my neck (Ooh)
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy (Ooooh ooh ooh)
The doctor looked and said ""He's gonna be a Bad Boy.""

[Hook: Faith Evans (BIG)]
I remember back in time
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time
Before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere yeah

[Verse 2: The Game (Faith Evans)]
Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God, to reverse it, I'll give my Left Eye
With the right I'll visualize the king of Bed-Stuy (Ooh)
Checkin' his daughter, Tyanna into junior high (Yeah)
If I was in Brooklyn and B.I. was still alive
In 2006, it might sound like this
NY, 7-1-8's, 2-1-2's
With Sue's rendezvous, it's like Moulin Rouge (Ohh ohh)
High fashion, uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez
Puerto Ricans with fat asses (Ooh ooh)
Blazed dutch masters, we dump ashes
On models in S classes for you bastards (Ohh ohh)
Catch a cab to Manhattan, with that Broadway actin'
You hype, that Belly shit'll get you capped and wrapped in plastic
Tell the captain to ask Rog' What's Happenin'?
I hear, nor speak no evil inside the magnum (Ooooh ooh ooh)

[Hook: Faith Evans (BIG)]
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
I remember back in time
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G. (Faith Evans)]
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team (Yeah-ah)
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream (Ooh oh)
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school, I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up (Ohh)
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself (No-oo)
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself (Oooh)
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it (Oh yeah)
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C-74, Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind a great steel gate (Oh no)
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail

255,Touch The Sky,Late Registration,Kanye West,2005-08-30,236600,69,"

[Chorus 1: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Outro: Kanye West]
We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
Sky, sky high! I’m, I’m sky high!
Yeah, keep it rollin'!
Yeah, uh, feels good to be home, baby!
Feels good to be home!

256,Remember the Name (feat. Styles of Beyond),The Rising Tied,Fort Minor,2005-11-21,230493,73,"

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
You ready? Let's go!
Yeah!
For those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this, y'all, c'mon!

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name (Mike!)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's picking it up, let's go

[Verse 2: Tak]
Who the hell is he, anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help (Help), or to get some respect ('Spect)
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds to the skill of an artist

[Verse 3: Ryu]
This is twenty percent skill (Uh), eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill (Next)
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
Then I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method ""Name of the Game"" (Uh-huh)
Came back, dropped ""Megadef,"" took 'em to church
I like ""Bleach"", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse (Ha-ha)
This dude is the truth, now, everybody giving him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fucking with S. Dot

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

[Verse 4: Ryu]
They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spitting fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fucking nihilist, porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot
Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

[Verse 5: Tak]
Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got, making his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
""Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?""
No, he's living proof (Proof), got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice (Juice)
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

[Verse 6: Mike Shinoda]
Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head, every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, the kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah! Fort Minor, M. Shinoda, Styles of Beyond
Ryu, Takbir, Machine Shop!

Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 1]
Summertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops down, you can hear the systems thump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'

[Chorus]
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 2]
Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, ""Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang.""
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you
Before somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen

[Chorus]
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper

And she getting hella freaky on the Ecstasy
Do her dance for me, song after song
Shorty won't stop, she goes all night long
Now that's a girl who know what she want in life
She a schoolgirl by day and a stripper by night

[Chorus: Mike Jones & Mr. Collipark]
I'm lookin' for a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind
I need a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind (Hey shawty)
You want this money then you gotta be a badd bitch
Shake that ass for the tip if you a badd bitch
Drop it down to the floor if you a badd bitch
Aw nah, she ain't a ho, she just a badd bitch

[Produced by Dr. Dre]

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady, you a basehead"" (Uh-uh)
""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole""

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?

She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his?

(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

[Chorus 2: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Trust me man it's ok, bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house they're like, ""Oh no""
50 got 'em locin again, they open again
Got 'em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'mma tell you what Em told me, homey
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's for sure
I got the info you already know
Man I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go

You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control

You wanna search me for certain but hurry up cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit these tricks will frame ya
But, in any event, keep fucking with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holler
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I don’t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starving
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it

I'm young, I'm black, I'm rich and yes
I'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
I'm cool, I'm calm you looking real stressed
I'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head
I'm known for gat popping, when I got problems

[Produced by Don Cannon]

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Guess who's back?
Still smell the blow in my clothes
Like Krispy Kreme, I was cooking them O's
Like horseshoes, I was tossing them O's
Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow
I'm emotional! I hug the block
I'm so emotional! I love my Glock
Cash rules everything around me, so what's realer?
About the scrilla, call me a Ghostface Killa
It's kinda hard to be drug-free
When Georgia Power won't give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles, been killin' em ever since
It pays to tell the truth, dog, it only makes sense

[Hook: Jeezy]
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimping, doing my thang

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
More than a hustla, I'm the definition of it
Master chef, lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than a street legend, homey, it's Hova
More than a relief pitcher, I'm the closer
The Mariano of the Mariott
If money talks, the whole world's about to hear me out
See, I'm a hustler's hope, I'm not his pipe dreams
So when they speak of success, I'm what they might mean
Attract money, my worst color is light green
My favorite hue is Jay-Z Blue
Don't follow me, young'un, follow my moves, I'm not a role model
My bad influence got the world drinking gold bottles
When Puff was in that tub spilling Mo
I was at my video, Cris on the speedboat
In My Lifetime, nigga, go through your research
St. Thomas, my nigga, that was me first
Chrome-shoe'd the GS, I came feet-first
In the game like a baby born to breach birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line, a dime at a time
My niggas love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start buggin cause I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like ""Nah Hov, talk that shit
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy Jay-Z!""
See I'mma ‘80s baby, master of Reaganomics
School of Hard Knocks, every day is college
You ain’t did nothin I ain’t did, nigga pay homage
Or pay the doctor, I sprayed Lami's
Still, the time’ll reveal, you know I’m bein honest
Ya ain’t put my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your shades cause your boy that bright

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Whattup Jeez?
Cracks...life, what's the matter with your head?
Cracks...life, all you niggas gon' end up dead
Cracks...life, everybody servin' rat til he ride
Everybody think they somebody, 'til somebody end up shot
Listen, I'm in that GT, chopper on the passenger side
No skeets skeets, chopper on the passenger side
They said Trap or Die but said fuck it
Damn near half my life I been a suspect
Feds low in them Coupe Devilles
So I keep one eye open like Bushwick Bill
They said my mind's playin' tricks on me
So I let off a half a clip on em'
Ain't no witnesses tellin' the story
Then my bitch spent all of the bail money
I done gave 'em my pimp cup for a gangsta hat
Traded my gangsta hat for some gangsta raps
Only to find out that no gangsta's rap
Half of these niggas is pussy, ain't never served crack
It's like a damn nightmare
Just when you thought I was gone, I reappear
On some chopped up, screwed shit, papi got his swagga back
Hot sick, clue shit, bought a brick of half of rap
In that 'cedes when it's said and done
Yeah papi kinda crazy, squeeze the pound for fun

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 4: Jeezy]
Won't stop til my whole team in thug mansion
And I say I like Pac, now that's a thug's passion
And this the realist shit I ever wrote
And all eyes on me, like a microscope
Young Jeezy give 'em one more chance
Tried to shine like you, and spent his whole advance
Like my main man Pulla, talk real slick
Look I'm ok, but my watch sick
Yean gotta like a nigga, just respect my mind
And this how I'm eatin now, so respect my grind
The way I put them words together
'Minds me how I used to put them birds together

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 5: Jeezy]
Buy 18 the hard way
Have a humble nigga thinking about gun play
Now who the fuck wanna play with guns?
A lot of holes, a lot of blood, dog...the shit ain't fun
So I suggest you don't play with my chains
I'll send these hollows atchya, let em play with ya brain
The streets is watching, the name is warm
The product's white, a star is born (Yeah!)
And I'm so fly, if I take this parachute off, I might fall and die
Wrap the work like spandex with the latex
Then we ship it out of town, call it safe sex

[Verse 1: The Game & (Sample)]
I woke up out that coma 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (""Dream"")
I had visions of makin' a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
It's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed

[Verse 2: The Game]
I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mýa
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
'Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""

""I-I-I love you"")

[Verse 3: The Game]
The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a Catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun

[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")

There's no way out, it seems I can't get free
Somebody tell me what's happened to me

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
The country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yeah, that sick nigga Biggie with the 8-shot fifth
With the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling?
All the blood spilling is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangsta, my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 with the hollow point slug
So when he licked shots, niggas dropped
Quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's, huh
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin' in the house of pain

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Is anybody listenin'?
Tell me, can you can see this darkness surrounding me?
Nights gettin' colder, heavy on my shoulder
And it's gettin' hard to breathe
Vision's gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried
'Cause it's gettin' hard to see
When you're livin' in the house of pain

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go!
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin', high, I'm a hustler
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto, you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AK's headin' for the 'burbs
Aimin' at them skinhead bitches, let it rain
Givin' 'em a wet welcome to the House of Pain

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Nas]
Is anybody listenin'? Tell me can you can see
This darkness surrounding me
Now it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder
And it's gettin' hard to breathe (MJB)
Vision's gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried (Be worried, niggas)
'Cause it's gettin' hard to see (Yeah, Nas)
When you're livin' in the house of pain
(What up, B.I., Pac?)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Wendy Williams say I stayed dusted, maybe I should
'Cause these rappers'll have your phone tapped like Savion Glove'
And on the West, yo, police corrupt, some are Bloods
But these Teflons I loaded explodin' some mugs
I'm like Furious in Boyz n the Hood, but at the drive-thru
I ain't runnin', I'm dumpin', crazy like a Piru
And loc'd up, know how Nas do
I'm callin' Henchmen and Concepcion, to organize a black truce
Then we party hard, party with Nas
Since there ain't no more - Mardi Gras
And Bush won't apologize
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize
Y'all yellin' my name, but y'all soon dyin'
Tryin' to portray real but they be lyin'
'Cause they want the real niggas to die so they could gain
But never that, this ain't Everlast, this the House of Pain

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Is anybody listenin'? Tell me can you can see
This darkness surrounding me
Now it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder
And it's gettin' hard to breathe
Vision's gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried
'Cause it's gettin' hard to see
When you're livin' in the house of pain

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some

Swisha House, Big Pokey and Paul Wall baby
It's the people's champ, I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school Impala
I'm with that Big Bank Hank, that Poppi Joe and Box

Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Ho's that diss me in the club, the same ho's in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T Ferris

Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats
I'm what they do, you on 5-9 double O
In the Tahoe on 24's, I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Couda Bang

Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say cheese and show my fronts
It's more carrots than Bugs Bunny's lunch
It's Paul Wall baby, I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil, and I'm paid plus I'm sittin' sideways

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some

What it do, I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills

I'm in the club posted up with some gang bangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank

Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Trying to find some 'Honey Love' my macking game is top rank
These ho's peeping me, ear hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, trying to figure which car I drive

I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping, look at that cold grillin' woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm sittin' sideways

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some

Maybe O.J's, ho's be going crazy when they see me
Sittin' sideways on them 24's
Watch ya ho, watch ya money, watch ya clothes
Single women's out the mold, glidin' like a ice skater

Motor like a snot nose
Suicide drop doors, mono blocks, chop mold
Customized deck, cause the mono block stock lows
Sadey Sade, Don Key, Paul Wall in the place

Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face
Redbones scoutin' together when I blaze
Boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle

From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together
Flossing, breaking of the intersection, crossing
Three-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses
S.U.C. in the door, M.O.B. on the place
Pull up in the driveway leanin' and I'm sittin'
(I'm sittin')

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some

[Beanie Sigel]
Bear witness to the greatest, can't beat us, join us
Keep heaters on us, with red lasers
Now fair warning, sure shots won't graze ya
We hug corners, play blocks like Gators
With bundles on us, serve tre's like waiters
It's the life we chose... to hustle
Can't stop it, can't knock it
Half the profit get flown out Vegas
Me and my niggas try and break tables
Stack chips like Connect Four
While you pricks try and whip try and stretch more
Charge less for, that ain't the program
Get ya lessons from the snow man
Like Pillsbury I get the dough man
I'll off ya head for a slice of bread
I keep my word and I'm true to my peeps
Give me a bird and my crew gon' eat
I'm over the stove like Cuban Links
Breaking down cash money like Baby do
You niggas soft like baby food
'Round the world niggas pay me dues
While you niggas sing the same old song like Sadies do
Grown man nigga, baby who?
I'll send you shots from the baby zoo
Old game like Grady fool
Propane flow flame you dudes
No name's don't claim ya shoes

Once again its on nigga, Sigel hard like corn liqour
I'll take you out this world like you was born nigga
Butt naked covered in blood, gasping for air
Clinging for dear life, nigga you dead right

[Jay-Z]
Since you was a baby coward
We been sprinkling the world with baby powder
So Fresh and So Clean
Been an outcast since I was a teen
But I outlast cuz I outblast anybody you bring
Young, you got it the prophet I told ya'll niggas
Then I showed ya'll niggas, you can't knock it
Don't get carried away, you a mule nigga (mule nigga)
Where was you nigga? I was doing this here like Mary J
Like everyday, and was true nigga

[Beanie Sigel]
They can't question what we do Jigga

[Jay-Z]
Once again it's on, Young run through you niggas
Like a glitch in the computer nigga
I'm the shit, I'm a sewer nigga
This is Jay everyday, no days off, Ferris Bueler nigga

[Beanie Sigel]
B-Sig' Fred Krueger niggas
Nightmare your medulla nigga
You scared cuz I grew with Jigga
He said ""Sig' you that nigga,"" couldn't see his vision
But then he drew the picture, like a compository sketch
Yeah Sig' stay honest I'll deposit you a check
There's a secret society, all we ask is trust
No G money shit all we gots is us
True indeed, yes, more better, yes
More cheddar, S.P. chain, jeans and sweaters
Movies, cartoons, labels, etcetera
Fill in the blanks and drop blocks like Tetris or
Get off the block, run south with M. Betha
From my block to your block, shout out to M Extra
Who the fuck (fuck) want (want) what (what)
None of you niggas is B-Sig' word I'm done with you niggas

[Beanie Sigel]
Once again it's on, fuck it we ain't through wit niggas
Twin towers here to ruin niggas
You couldn't break up the towers with Tomjanovich
Or Osama bombin' shit
We slay niggas wit K's, we the drama men
Get it right young scrap don't even try it boy (boy)
You rather slide down the razor blade slidin' board
I'm a live wire, hula hoop barb wire
Run through hell with gasoline draws on
You can't mute me put the pause on
My guns shoot like fast-forward's on
And dress cute when the war's off
What you doing dawg, you playing wit it
You make your bed right you laying in it
You keep your shed tight you stayin' in it
You bringing niggas where your kids sleep
I sing to niggas while the kids sleep
Rock-a-bye muthafucka
I hope you high muthafucka
Ready to die muthafucka

Who shot ya? Separate the weak from State Prop' the
Kids who squash beef and run them streets

[Jay-Z]
Once again it's on nigga, bring the drama to ya lawn nigga
Tell ya mama ""bye bye"" get ready to mourn sister, it's a
See what you got here's a full blown twister
You nothing but hot air, it's not fair
The reason why we lead the pack, this is a marathon
You start off fast then you wheezing in the back
So even if I slack, I got enough lee-way
To put out The Reason by the Mac, Philadelphia Freeway
And I'm back, without leaving I'm here, but you can't see him
I gave you the Blueprint but you can't be him
So no matter what you been told or the records you sold
Deep inside you know that it's only one Hov
Young Vito, voice of the young people
If my life is a movie then Sigel be the sequel
We bring it to your door with Bleek peeking through your peek hole
And don't get scared nigga, alert ya people

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well I came in the door, I said it befo'
I never fuck a ho without head no more
I never pour up with nothing less than a four
And I smoke cigars, it ain't just for the show
I'm blessed from the do', and known for my stidile
I send a nigga baby mamma home with a smidile
You can have the bitch nigga, I ain't sentimental
Smoke weed and freestyle, no instrumental
Been out, lived through the wicked streets of PA
Motherfuck the judge, prosecutor and the DA
Head to the H, where the hoes will fuck threeway
Two way, four way, anyway the Pro say
Never hear a ho say ""no I won't,"" ""no I can't,""
""Stop it,"" and ""no I don't""
'Cause a bitch know that I might just explode
And slap her in the face with a Pie à la Mode

Something foreign I’m tourin' on foreign land
Worldwide I'm known for the Arm & Ham-
-mer—der the streets, I'm a wanted man
(But the flow's like dope) So it's on again
Started with the block, hit it brick by brick
Then I charted with the Roc nigga, hit by hit
I'm retarded with the Glock nigga, clip by clip
The competition is none, they deceased to exist
Let it breathe a little bit
He's off his rocker, he's a little schitz'
Throwed like a football, Hov used to cook raw
Now I got the game sewn like granny's good shawl
Pshaw, y'all niggas want war
Y'all got it backwards, y'all should want raw
Y'all should want more (and more, and more - uhh!)

272,Drive Slow,Late Registration,Kanye West,2005-08-30,272226,58,"

[Intro: Kanye West]
Boom, b-boom, b-boom-boom

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me ""K-Rock"" so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back— back then— then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had them Lincolns and Au-rurr-ras, we was hurting 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dog—
Fuck all that flirting—now, I'm tryna get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me, ""Don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie""

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
(Drive slow)
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth, relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie

[Chorus: Kanye West & GLC]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homie
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homie
Live today, 'cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby, this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (Just a lil bit)
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm riding on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tiptoes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Oh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo
Mm, hm
Oh, oh, ooh, hoo, ooh
Mm, hm
Oh, oh, ooh, hoo, ooh
Mm, mm, mm, mm

[Outro: Kanye West & Tony Williams]
Yeah
B-boom, b-boom-boom
Oh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo
Mm, hm
Drive slow, homie
Oh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo
Mm, hm
Drive slow, homie
Oh, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo
Mm, hm
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
Mm, hm
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie

Bring the crowd in, I'm loud in living color
It is Weezy Fuckin' Baby, got these rappers in my stomach
Yummy, I'm taking it, I ain't askin' them for nothing
If you sell a million records, we could battle for your money
I'd rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a Sunday
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play
Still stuntin', baby, yes, I'm still flossin'
Latest car on the market with the top peeled off it
Big wheels make it look a little bulky
You look a little salty, have yourself a chilled coffee
Chill out, the guns is still out
Even though I am a boss and got papers to fill out
I'm busy, I got paper to reel in
God, I hope they snappin' at the end of my rod
I hope I'm fishin' in the right pond
And I hope you catchin' on to every line, who am I?

Livin' and breathin', stealin' and feedin'
Peelin' and leavin', killin' and grievin'
Dearly departed, erased, deleted
No 'prints, no plates, no face, no trace
Out of sight, out of mind, no court, no case
Sell his chain, celebrate, block party, second line
Zulu Ball, Essence Fest, Jazz Fest, Mardi Gras
Shotty bounce, body rock, now he dropped, now he got
Family try tell the feds, tell the cops
Smell a rat comin' back to the house, to the spot
Tap-tap, knock-knock, who is that? Chk-pow
Triggaman, hoodie man, tell the kids Boogieman
Pistol Pete, Ammo Mammal, gunman, blum-blam (Haha)

Whew, smell like a bunch of pussy to me
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em good, fuck 'em long
Fuck 'em hard, fuck who? Fuck 'em all
Yeah, like that, just like that, right back
I'm on that money train and that MAC'll knock 'em off track
The quarterback, well-protected from the Warren Sapp
The young heart attack, I spit that cardiac
You can't see me, baby boy, you got that cataracts
I'm right here, straight out the hood just like an alley cat
Since everyone's a king, well, where the fuck your palace at?
Me? I got callous on my hands, I can handle that

Can't tell me nothin' different (Different), my nose twitchin' (Twitchin')
Intuition setting in like Steve vision (Uh)
I still close my eyes, I still see visions
Still hear that voice in the back of my mind (Mind)
So what I do? I still take heed, I still listen (Listen)
I still paint that perfect picture
I still shine bright like a prism, my words still skippin'
Through air, I know you can't, don't, won't get it (You square)
You niggas chose to ride that ship, sunk with it
I'm still afloat
I ain't the captain of the yacht, but I'm on the boat
I ain't acting what I'm not knowing that I don't
You niggas acting like you will, but I know you won't (You won't, man)
I read between the lines of the eyes and your brows
Your handshake ain't matching your smile, aha, you niggas foul

I can hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air

Ready to go bananas
Two vests on me (Vests on me), two TECs, extra clips on me (Clips on me)
I know my mind ain't playing tricks on me (Damn)
I ain't schiz', homie (Homie), ain't nobody drop a mick on me (Mick on me)
It's like they trying to plot and sit on me
I hear this voice in the back of my mind
Like, ""Mack, tighten up your circle before they hurt you""
Read they body language (Body language)
Eighty-five percent communication nonverbal
Eight-five percent swear they know you, ten percent (You know they story)
Man, the other five, time'll show you, just know you
Then pull they strings, you the puppet master (Puppet master)
Fuck them other bastards (Man), man, watch who you puffin' after
Play your cards, go against all odds
Shoot for the moon, if you miss, you still amongst those stars

Can you feel the grim reaper floatin'? (Can you feel the grim reaper floatin'?)
Foul preacher quotin'
Scriptures from Revelation, was talk shit and got the devil waiting
Body gettin' stiff (Stiff), soul levitatin' (Levitatin')
Why do I speak blasphemy
Knowing one day that he'll ask for me? As for my sins
No one'll feel his wrath for me
I go through it, so you wouldn't do it after me
As for me, I'm still circling the block before I'm parkin'
Not bitching, I'm just still cautious
Same black parka
Same Uzi, extra clips, still clapping with that same Lorcin
Damn, I feel it in the air, you not sincere

It's a good-bad karma thing, this a song man of honor sing
I swear I feel something, honestly

But y'all niggas is boring me, I'm never gon' change up, please

With a head full of smarts man

Cause they don't know about the business we be handling

Okay, show me what you got babe
Words is slurring, engine purring
Mami front, but I'm so determined
Shots of Patron, now she in the zone

Mami in the zone like the homie two-three
Jordan or James, makes no difference
We all ballin' the same
Nigga, I am the Mike Jordan of recordin'
Nigga, you might want to fall back from recordin'
Shit, what you write is not important
So it forced him to go for the hype
For being brave they may applaud him
But misery, I will assure them

All these dudes know how to say is gimme
Gimme some head, gimme some brain
Gimme your number, gimme your name
But if I get one night baby girl, I swear
I'll make you tell these other dudes gimme got you here
I'll take you shopping, take long trips
I'll take the cork off, you can take sips
I'll take you there, take my time
Take your clothes off, you take off mine
Ma, show me what you got
Hovi in the spot, tried to told you I was hot
Tell these other dudes it's a wrap
Get the fuck out the throne you clone, the King's back!
Y'all got less than two months to get y'all thing together
Good luck

283,Push It,Port Of Miami,Rick Ross,2006-01-01,208600,60,"

[Intro]
Push it to the limit

[Verse 1]
Port of Miami (uhh), I'm importin' the candy (uhh)
Ain't got nothin' to lose, we supportin' the family
Never traffic for fun, only traffic for funds
All I seen is the struggle, it's like I'm trapped in the slums
Workers were barely paid, no water, we barely bathe
There better be better days on the way that's on my daddy grave
I'm pushin' it hard, I'm pushin' it soft
If he pushin' a line, he pushin' for Ross
I waited and waited, I done ran out of patience
They hated and hated, left him slow dancin' with Satan
Fresh in my white tee, Mac-11, swear to God
I bought my first block, broke it down and tore the block apart

[Hook]
I push and I push, I ride and I ride
Tryna survive on 95
Put it all on the line every drop of a dime
I be pushin' them whips, yep, three at time
I'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)
II'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)

[Verse 2]
I handle dope like a vandal off the banana boat
Bananas in our rifles, no cyphers, I'm just the man to know
I paid dues, my moves done made news
I'm smooth, my suede shoes they new like Ray shoes
Nobody used to speak, now e'rybody wave
You duck your momma house, you set your sister straight
I'm buildin' a dream, with elevators in it
Tailor made the linen, no gators got on my hater-vision
I see ya, I see ya suckers, I see ya clear
I know you see me in that Phantom whiter than veneers
Allergic to broke, determined to blow
On the boat we hid the work in detergent and soap
We ship it from Haiti, baby I'm whippin' them babies
Let it dry, let it dry, try to whip a Mercedes
Arrangin' my Range, here to rain ya parade
You gotta push it to the limit you wanna be paid

[Hook]
I push and I push, I ride and I ride
Tryna survive on 95
Put it all on the line every drop of a dime
I be pushin' them whips, yep, three at time
I'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)
II'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)

[Verse 3]
We started minute, the money matured
My money's secured, I got bundles in Europe
My bubble be pure, it cost like a hundred a pull
The world is yours, hundred million or more
Now I run the streets, they all mine
12 years overdue, call it due time
I told you never roll on the soul of a soldier
You never know that dishwasher may be the beholder
Whoever thought that fat girl would grow into Oprah
Or that boy Rick Ross would be moldin' the culture
I push and push, we breakin' the mold
We push and we push, we rake in the hold

[Hook]
I push and I push, I ride and I ride
Tryna survive on 95
Put it all on the line every drop of a dime
I be pushin' them whips, yep, three at time
I'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)
II'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)

Konvict (Yea! Shady!)
Konvict Muzik (Guess who's back?)
Still here, haters
Akon and Obie Trice, yeah
Whatcha gonna do it with it, A?
Whatcha gonna do?
Take 'em all back to the streets

[Hook: Akon]
I keep the .40 cal on my side
Steppin' with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon' lace you
Just don't, whatever you do, snitch
'Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
It's risky, the bitch tend to rise out a nigga
It's history, snitch, who decided he's a member?
Once he got pinched, coincided with law
Same homie say he lay it down for the bul
Brought game squad around ours
How could it be? Been homies since Superman drawers
Only phoniness never came to par
He had us, a true neighborhood actor
Had his back with K's, now we see through him like X-Ray's
Cuffed in that Adam car
No matter, his loss, we at him, it's war
Knowin' not to cross those reservoir dogs
You helped plant seeds just to be a vegetable?
When we invest in team, it's to the death for sho'
No X and O's
TEC's, Calico's aimed at your chest, nigga

[Hook: Akon]
I keep the .40 cal on my side
Steppin' with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon' lace you
Just don't, whatever you do, snitch
'Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
We started out as a crew, when one speak it's all honest
Private conferences when we eat, Benihana's
Reconnaissance when we peep enemies on us
Been on these corners, sellin' like anything on us
Knowin' Heaven has shown us bein' devil's minors
But that ain't got shit to do with the tea in China
We gon' keep the grind up 'til death come find us
Meantime leanin' in them European whips reclined up
It's eye for an eye for the riders
We ain't tryin' to get locked up, we sole survivors
Po-po's is cowards, it's no you, it's ours
We vowed this, mixin' yayo with soda powder
Who woulda known he would fold and cower?
Once the captain showed he sold to Old McDonald
So it's no X and O's
TEC's, Calico's aimed at your chest, nigga

[Hook: Akon]
I keep the .40 cal on my side
Steppin' with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon' lace you
Just don't, whatever you do, snitch
'Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah

[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Nowadays, Sammy The Bull's got the game fooled
So he move to a rural area to keep cool
They snitchin' on a snitch now, it's nothin' to tell
Nowadays your circle should be small as hell
Ain't tryin' to meet new faces, this don't interest me
Even if we bubble slow we'll get it eventually
No penitentiary, there'll be no clemency
You will meet the Lord, snitch, in givin' us a century
These cats is rats now, the streets need D-Con
That's how they react now, weak when the heat's on 'em
Stop snitchin', you asked for the life you're livin'
This act is not permitted nowhere on the map
It is forbidden to send a nigga to prison
If you been in it along with 'em, then snitch and become hidden
So it's no X and O's
TEC's, Calico's aimed at your chest, nigga

[Hook: Akon]
I keep the .40 cal on my side
Steppin' with the mindstate of a mobster
You see a nigga pass by
Tuck your chain in 'cause he might rob ya
Got Glocks for sale, red tops for sale
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon' lace you
Just don't, whatever you do, snitch
'Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah

[Verse 1]
Pull the rag off the six-fo'
Hit the switch, show niggas how the shit go
The Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone
The Ds is chrome, the frame is black (So watch it lift up)
'Til the motherfucker bounce and break
And knock both of the screws out the licence plate
Let the games begin
These other rap niggas so far behind me could taste my rims
Shit, let the chronic burn as the Daytons spin
It ain’t been this much drama since I first heard Eminem
In the club, poppin' X pills like M&Ms
Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend
Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round
And put that cheap-ass Hypnotic down (Put your ‘cris up!)
If you feel the same way
Who got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA

[Chorus]
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the whole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath

[Verse 2]
Somebody tell me where the drinks at, where the bitches at
You fuckin' on the first night, meet me in the back
I got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks
Move bitch! Who the fuck you think they came to see?
The protégé of the D-R-E
Take a picture with him, then you gotta fuck me
And you gotta fuck Busta, can’t touch Eve
Got somethin' in my waist that you can’t touch either
That’s, my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods
I’m in the club on some gangsta shit (So nigga twist up)
Light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fightin' in the club
Ain’t nothin' but a g-thing, baby it’s a g-thing
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string
I fuck a different bitch seven days a week
Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat

[Chorus]
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath

[Verse 3]
Niggas thought I wasn’t coming back, look at me now
Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo'
With the motherfucking top down, I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre you passed me the torch
I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion ‘till the ass scrapes
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race
Now watch it bounce
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down
(When you hit the club)
Tell 'em you came with me (We gonna twist up)
In the V.I.P
It’s a new day, and if you ever knew Dre
Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre
Same Impala, different spokes
Same chronic, just a different smoke

[Chorus]
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath

[Intro: Akon]
Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're —""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase""
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3: Akon]
Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, because lately

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Yeah, that's right, I like that
The royal penis is clean your highness
Thank you, uh, uh
Snoop, Kells
You know how we get down

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like ""That's that shit""
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like ""That's that shit""
Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say ""That's that shit""

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me get you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like ""That's that shit""

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Dippin' low, '64, hundred spokes and chronic smoke
All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like ""That's that shit""
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees

[Intro]
Yeah, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, come on

[Hook]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Verse 1]
I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a goddamn thang changed
It’s the same old same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day-to-day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower-livin'?
The projects, thank God for Russell Simmons
Thank God for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggas taken over showbiz

[Hook]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Verse 2]
It's boys in the hood, it's toys in the hood
Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood
‘Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a Crip and a Blood in the hood
‘Cause when niggas get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by Five-O
Grandmama came to court with her Bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled
Owned by C.A, State Property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?

[Hook]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Verse 3]
Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the 4-4 up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming, but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
D game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' them up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Aye, y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
‘Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

[Hook]
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, stop trippin on it
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same

Every time I give you bang shit to knock in ya whip

[Intro: The Game & Junior Reid]
Dre, I see dead people
Modern vampires of the city
Hunting blood
Blood
Blood
Yo, Dre
Thought I was dead
West Coast
(One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood)

[Verse 1: The Game]
I'm the Doctor's Advocate, nigga, Dre shot ya
Brought me back from the dead
That's why they call him the doctor
The 'Math gon' drop him
And 50 ain't rocking with him no more
It's okay! I get it popping
Whole club rocking, like a six-four Impala
Drink Cris', throw it up, call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup, call the shit Hpnotiq (Brrrrat!)
I bleed Compton, spit crack and shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit but new niggas
Bathing Ape-shoe niggas, I'm talking to you, niggas
Bouncing in the '64, throwing up West side, man
Sell another 5 million albums? Yes, I am
Fresh like ""Damn, this nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, L.A. above the brim""
Inside the Lambo shotgun with Snoop
What would the muthafuckin' West Coast be
Without one crip and

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
One blood
One blood
One blood
One blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
One blood

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm from the Westside of the six-four Impala
Where niggas say ""Where you from?""
We don't never say ""Harlem""
Bandanna on the right side, gun on the left side
Niggas in New York know how to throw up the Westside
Word to Eazy, I'm so ill, believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
I'm the king, and Dre said it: the West Coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep trying me
Everybody know that I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't gotta make shit for the club
What DJ gon' turn down the thirty-eight snub?
You 38 and you still rapping? Ughhh
I'm 26, nigga, so is the dubs
On the '07 Hummer, hop out, no bodyguards
When the chronic smoke clear all you gon' see is

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
One blood
One blood
One blood
One blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood
One blood

[Verse 3: The Game]
I ain't got beef with 50, no beef with Jay
What's beef when you getting head in the six-trey?
And the double Game chain, I keep 'em on display
Black T-shirt, so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV, and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away
I don't regret what I spit, 'cause I know what I say
And niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock
No beam, no silencer; I know when to pop
Wait 'til Lil Jon come on and let off a shot
I had the number one Billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers, and I climb right back to the top
I'm B.I.G., I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac
This ain't shit but a warning 'til my album drop

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
One blood
One blood
One blood
One blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood
One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood

Got the whole club leaning with it, and party rocking
Drunk driving in my cut dawg, I got my truck parked
'72 Tennessee Titan, like what up y'all
I'm home boy, holla at your homeboy
Better come quick, once I get it then it's gone, boy
First come first serve, fuck what you heard
I'm piecing out my pack till I come up on a bird
Blow the smoke out my nose, pimping on these hoes
They know me at the bank love me at the jewelry stores

On them old school vogues with the chrome on the toes
These fuck niggas know, that I will let it go
I bet he got a vest
No but I got my tech though

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Man, don't you know that I'm loco?
Mhm, hm

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I was chillin' (Chillin') right around my way (Way)
21st, east side of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin' shit with his homies like he was a straight G
Askin' where I'm from while he runnin' up
Gangbang my set on e'ry one of 'em (20's, nigga, 20's)
Some things, sons, they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin' but the gangbang (Bang)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin' like a marathon
Lil' G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talkin' 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (Mm)
But they don't know once they get close
It's tic-tac-toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (Watch out)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray, I heard a ese say, he said

[Chorus: B-Real & Snoop Dogg]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, ""You know who we are""
He said, ""I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg"" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Post-Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now there's three motherfuckers dead and I ain't seen shit
But these niggas'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case, really, you could see
I crack the MAC back and pop off rollin'
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin'
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were broads
Believin' all the things that you never saw
In it, y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my dope? What the fuck? No
See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed, all you hear my enemies goin'

Vato, you won't believe what I saw

(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in they mouth, goddamn
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat (Heat)
You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be ""Beast of the East"", motherfucker
I never hesitate to blaze (Blaze)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, 'cause my peoples
Is screamin' that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Ba-ba-bang on a song, make it feel like a drive-by (Drive-by)
It's a shame, but somebody gotta die (Die)
They see it happen state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin' L.A., all I hear the eses say, they go

I dropped some change, its easy for me to cop them things
And I don't stop, I got rocks and rings, you know
The same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the back yard
I ain't gotta act hard, I'm under 21 with a black card
And yea I know that was kind of a low blow
But the dough for the So So don't come slow

Hands up! Shorty, when you party with me
We goin' way past quarter to three
(I say hands up!) I'm good in the VIP
I got my hammer right here with me
(I say hands up!) You know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jux
(I say hands up!) Everything ain't cool as the fame
And this shit ain't as sweet as it looks (I say hands up!)
You know I'm puttin' something on me
Right before I leave outta the car (We came to party)
You go tough talkin' at me
You gon' leave out the club wit a scar (We came to party)
We pop bottles like it's all free
'Fore I leave, I'mma buy out the bar (We came to party)
You gon' order whatchu want, it's on me
I'm a G, take a look at a star (We came to party)

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
It feels so good to live sucka free
I'm soakin' it all up while your girl's suckin' me
It mean the world to her, it's nuttin' but a nut to me
Look miss, get a grip or let a mothafucker be
I'm a rap star, who 'posed to be ridin' around in that car
Two in the front, in the back got the plasma
This ain't a free ride, you gotta have the gas ma
I wouldn't buy a chick a pump that got asthma
And I'm busy so I move a bit faster
You can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya, huh
I'm a bastard, damn near chauvinist, hand over the plastic
Cause they wanna see ya man go in the casket
Rule number one: keep ya gun or get ya ass hit
And that's it, lights off and ya body stiff
By the same niggas you used to party with

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Yea
I cruise through the strip, 22's on the whip, new Ruger on the hip
Thousand dollar outfit, never stooge never slip
Follow rules or get whipped, nigga move or get hit
I don't care who's on the strip
It ain't only the Ferrari now, the jewels got 'em sick
Now it's 2006, I need a new bottom miss
It's a'ight, they can talk, I'm amused by the pricks
I'm the news out the bricks, nigga, who's hot as this?
I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed
I ain't a cuddler, I fuck the drool outta chick
My niggas ice-grill, but it ain't the same
They don't see the faces, they just see the chains like
OOH when ya get 'em, they don't know you with me
They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me
This regular shit, the everyday mentality
They charged up, don't make me put in the battery

301,The Way I Live - Main Explicit,Across The Water,Baby Boy Da Prince,2006-01-01,324906,57,"

[Chorus]
This is the way I live
Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live
Lil' Boy still pushin' big wheels
I stack my money, lay low, and chill
Don't need to work hard that's the way I feel, I feel, I
This is the way I live

Six months later now we're big dog status
Name elevated but I still act average
Rockin' shows in Dallas, ball like I play for the Mavericks
West Bank rapper and I'm one of the baddest
French Rivera spot and I am getting in shape man
I think I'm Super M-a-n without a cape man
Ridin' all day hustlin', all for the cake man
I'm a Benjamin stack one inch taller than Great Danes
First they made cheap Ray-Ban like a felon
I'm growin' up now spittin' hotter than Mohellans
I'm a steal every girl ever gon' to fly
I'm a young little dude, stay runnin' from cops
Emerald Row is the place where I got my props
People love me in the hood they don't want me to stop
So uhh, that's the only way I know how to rock
And I'm a stay rappers like won't stop 'til I drop

[Chorus]
I I's Baby Boy and I done it again
I'm ridin' fly with D-Wizzle in 'cedes Benz
Twenty two wanna ride with the ladies then
Red Bull, Grey Goose, now the ladies bent
Now we go and do a thing under a shady tent
And they don't question what I say 'cause I'm a ladies pimp
See this little one right here this fellow got stripes
And I is represent, my rail room for life
Money in my pocket but I still act trife
While I in the club they say the parlor ain't right
Look I'm--doing great that's the way I feel
Hustlin' hard all day that's the way I live

[Chorus]
This the two-seat rider with the ketchup inside
Red pepper paint must believe my ish ride
They pause like stop signs when they rollin' up
Cause' when the doors open up, they open UP
I'm Lamboin' it I was stashed, off stage I'm throwin' it
Cause they say I'm like Katrina with money, I blow the shhhh
Real been gravy, three years out of the eighties
Solos, shabo's valley animals played it
Commodores mirages, not the Nike hirages
It cost 250 on up to put your foot inside this
Y'all was wearing rocks that was my time to shine
Don't give me viesels y'all thinkin' this McDonalds size
I been fly I from the crib to the ride
Fifty-Four inch screens 26 inches from the ceiling dude
The plasma look like a projector up in the livin' room homie!

Uh oh, uh oh, oh! Oh! Oh!
They ain't ready for this
L.T. Hutton, T.I., Ashanti
It's that new 'Pac, y'all

[Chorus: Ashanti + (2Pac)]
Pac's life (Everybody needs to chill)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life
(It's 2Pac the king)
What do you know about Pac's life?
What do you know? What do you know?
(Only real niggas stay on top)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life (Outlawz)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill him
Never figured that that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a madman, nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
Dodgin' cop cars, look at how we come so far
Picture a high school drop-out roll in a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out, so when trouble tried to find me – can't
Never visioned livin' longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out, or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change, it comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfuckers speakin' down on me, this is the night
Why's everybody caught up in Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas conversatin' on my life
Mind your motherfuckin' business!

[Chorus: Ashanti + (2Pac) & T.I.]
Pac's life (Everybody needs to chill)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life
What do you know about Pac's life?
What do you know? What do you know?
(Only real niggas stay on top)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life (Outlawz)
I remember that, ayy

[Verse 2: T.I]
What's happenin', Pac? Yeah, I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first: fake niggas can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for nothin', it was a shame to see
You know the crackers came, they did the same thang to me
I get along with real niggas, it's the lane to be
Talkin' loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket, let it rain, you see
Now they all in the courtroom, blamin' me
See, we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas, death to the suckers
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour, never talk to undercovers
Live by the same rules, so minus the tattoos
We the same sort of dude with the same short fuse

[Chorus: Ashanti + (2Pac)]
Pac's life (Everybody needs to chill)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life
What do you know about Pac's life?
What do you know? What do you know?
(Only real niggas stay on top)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major weight 'cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em weary
While you frontin' like you Billy Badass, nigga, you scary
I been knowin' you for years, we was high school peers
In Junior High I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin' niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga, it's how it is
Only real niggas stay on top, word up!

[Chorus: Ashanti + (2Pac)]
Pac's life (Everybody needs to chill)
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life
(Why y'all niggas all up in my shit?)
What do you know about Pac's life?
(Tell them motherfuckers!)
What do you know? What do you know?
Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life

See, this ain't nuttin that you use to
Out of the ordinary, unusual
You gotta have the mind state like ""I'm so great""
Can't nobody do it like you do
Miraculous, phenomenal
And ain't nobody in here stoppin' you
Show no love 'cause you wassup
Look at yaself in the mirror like what the fuck

Damn, I look good
And can't nobody freak it like I could
Yeah, OK, I got a little fat, but
My shorty told me that he like it like that
I'm happy
Another me there never can be
See, I'm so outstandin'
Don't care if they can't stand me
I'm sittin' on top of the world like Brandy

See, I look too good for this necklace
And I look too good to be wearing this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited. I got a reason

See, I look way too good to be driving that
And I look too good to be buying that
You know I look way too good to be trying that
I'm conceited. I got a reason

Now who's that peaking in my window?
Nobody 'cause I live in a penthouse
Baby, I'm sorry, but I'm sexy
And all I want you to do is just bless me, let's see
This kid that I'm waitin' on
He said he love when my jeans look painted on
Wit a tight white tee, you ain't quite like me
Probably why I'm always getting hated on
Now shorty trynna push up on me like a Wonderbra
Listen, when I speak out I wouldn't want you take it wrong
Now number one, I don't need you
Ya name's Q, I only see you when I see you
Listen two, you can never play me
(Why is that? Why is that?)
'Cause I'm such a fuckin' lady
Three, it's all about me and I don't wanna talk about it
If you love to hear it, here it go
I wrote a song about it

See, I look too good to be fucking you
And I look too good to be loving you
You know I look way too good to stuck with you
I'm conceited. I got a reason

See, I look too good to be gettin' with
And I look too good to be havin' kids
You know I look way too good to be in the crib
I'm conceited. I got a reason

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I don't know what I'm doing
I can't stop, my body gone moving
I'm boppin' and poppin' to the music
He's watching me and he's about to lose it
I'm droppin' that hotta den drop it like its hot
Face down, ass up wit some new shit
I'm outta control wit it
Dip it low, pick it up slow, poke it out, now roll wit it
My thong showin', but it's cool, my shoes go wit it
Now all I need is a room wit a pole in it
See, I look good and I'm knowin it
But I was never to proud to be showin it

See, I look too good for this necklace
And I look too good to be wearing this
You know I look way too good to be innocent
I'm conceited. I got a reason

See, I look way too good to be driving that
And I look too good to be buying that
You know I look way too good to be trying that

[Intro]
I wear a mean dark pair of shades
And you can't see my eyes
Unless my head is bent, you dig

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 1]
Ya boy gettin' paper (money), I buy big cars (foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (choose one!)
Stay sky high, twisted, fly with the stars (twinkle, twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin' (flossin'!)
I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted (do it!)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistenin' (ballin'!)
But I spent 'bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doin' the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (what else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screamin', ""Fuck the cops!""

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)

Slow down, tonight may be gone tomorrow (one chance)
So I speed through life like there's no tomorrow (speedin'!)
100 G's worth of ice on the Audemars (flossin'!)
And we in the street life 'til they call the law (ballin'!)
I made the whip get naked (what happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 AM we was at the club (what happened?)
2 AM: ten bottles of bub (money ain't a thing)
And by 3-somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (twisted)

We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)

[Verse 3]
Nigga, could you buy that? I keep 20 in the pocket (light change)
Talk a buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic (that Grey Poupon)
But of course got a Flying Spur
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (get your money up!)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got a urge (speedin'!)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous, livin' in the fast lane (ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'ma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)

So if you could just shake it a little this way
See I'm a member of the BBC
The original breadwinner of DTP
You the center of attention that is distracting the squad
Cause everybody in the campus like - OH MY GOD she can

[Hook: Pharrell Williams & Ludacris]
Shake your money maker like somebody's bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar, don't you act like you're afraid of shit
You know I got it, If you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like - ey ey ey
Shake your money maker like somebody's bout to pay ya
Don't worry about them haters, keep your nose up in the air
You know I got it, If you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money like - ey ey ey

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know

This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now, homie, I say I run it, run it 'cause I'm in control
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patrón
I have you feelin' a'ight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin', shawty says she comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle; you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga, you front, you gon' get it, okay, now maybe I've said it
'Cause I want you to tridip, yeah, I be on that shidit
You should see when I'm stuntin', I flash the stones to be wantin'
Push the whip, see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know the Unit's the gang
I got my grimy Shady with me, you front, you'll have to get me
Off yo' ass, I pay the lawsuit and laugh
Haha! It's not a big deal, it's nothin' but some cash

This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight we ain't come in here to beef with nobody
We came to party: Banks, Ca$his, and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?
Come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? I said, you know but you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin'; J.F.K
HK 'til your chest plate cave
I'ma ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Pussy, I'll survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad have called me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa Queens, mixed in with Ca$his creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' G?
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all-way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?
See…

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
You know who this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
Lloyd Banks, Ca$his, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50
It's a movement, you can't stop it

309,Black Republican,Hip Hop Is Dead (Expanded Edition),Nas,2007-01-23,225386,39,"

[Produced by L.E.S & Wyldfyer]

[Intro: Jay-Z (Nas) & Both]
I know you can feel the magic, baby
Turn the motherfuckin' lights down
Esco, whattup? (Whattup, homie?)
I mean, it's what you expected, ain't it? (Hahaha)
Let's go... uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh, yeah, that's perfect (yeah, right, right)
Uhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka (hahaha!)
Make niggas mad and shit like
Niggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, nigga, go in!
Just start dancin' in this muh'fucka
Yeah, (yeah) we just come outta nowhere

[Chorus: Jay-Z (Nas)]
I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, like, ""Fuck it then""

[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Nas)]
Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (what?)
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end?
Like Ice Cold's album (uhh), all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign, could bring
Should blame, the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
And forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing
Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings
It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching
The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy – indefinitely

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas]
I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them (nah)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""

[Verse 2: Nas (Jay-Z)]
I'm back in the hood, they like, ""Hey Nas"" (uh)
Blowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives (uh)
Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5s, hatah's wishin' our reign dies
Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, ""Why""? (uhh)
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good, that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce (uhh)
To get his feet out of them Converse – that's my word

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Nas]
I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, ah, ""Fuck it then""
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""

[Scratched samples]
You can't hide, you can't run
Remember to, always be true, no matter what you do
Run it, I never fronted, I got my whole crew life on it
Think sharp, man listen
You can't hide, you can't run
Remember to, always be true, no matter what you do
Run it, I never fronted, I got my whole crew life on it

[Hook]
Any day your last day might come so
You can't hide, you can't run
Late night or in the shadows when the daylight comes remember
You can't hide, you can't run, man listen
Any day your last day might come so
You can't hide, you can't run
From the truth, we know each and every day fights come, remember
You can't hide, you can't run

[Rakaa Iriscience]
It's like it's Final Destination, you tryin your best to make it
They say be patient but you know you're cheating death, it's chasing
Heart beatin, pulse racin, but I keep the pace and
Train to be the best and beat the best by the Gracie
Grappler spectacular rapper sport of altercation
In self-defense we hem em up, a tailored alteration
We're firestarters, leaving stages up in flames
Then again we're firefighters, spraying at whatever's blazing
Crazy ways to express and pass information
Daily making the best of bad situations
We fight to win in whatever type of test we're facing
Hip-hop came while they were underestimating
Amazing grace how sweet the sound, that's what I was raised in
But then the crack and gangs flourished under Ronald Reagan
Life insurance for kids, undertakers waiting
Earth is purgatory, here between the pearly gates and Satan

[Hook]
Any day your last day might come so
You can't hide, you can't run
Late night or in the shadows when the daylight comes remember
You can't hide, you can't run, man listen
Any day your last day might come so
You can't hide, you can't run
From the truth, we know each and every day fights come, remember
You can't hide, you can't run

[Evidence]
I stay relevant
Only person I stand in the shadow of is Evidence
Last page, I left off a good look
This ain't the next chapter, it's a whole new book
About to steal the game, I'm a whole new crook
Baking up that fire, I'm a whole new cook
Get your whole shit took, Cali's back under the sun
So you can't hide, and you can't run
From the truth, some ain't convinced so they decide to try me
Like I give a fuck, we live from India.Arie
They got spies in cameras and trailers
We see em setting up though we on counter-surveillance
On to me, I'm on to you, it's no mystery
Better think fast though, the future just your history
It's where the plot thickens, regardless of wealth
Cause the worst person to run from is yourself

[Hook]
Any day your last day might come so
You can't hide, you can't run
Late night or in the shadows when the daylight comes remember
You can't hide, you can't run, man listen
Any day your last day might come so
You can't hide, you can't run
From the truth, we know each and every day fights come, remember
You can't hide, you can't run

Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean

Dro, I'm clean in dis b***h
Now I'm finna shoulder lean in this b***h
N***a buck, carbon 15 in dis b***h
This Grand Hustle team of kings is getting rich
I lean and get lit, lima bean 6
I take breath, the opposite of primotine mist
I ride 26, and let my nine screens flip
Trunk be watchin Oprah, Mac 9 up in a clip
Triple black phantom, n***a nah it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charm diamonds man, but nah it ain't Flip
Can't bounce, okay, then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk, and I bet my motor clean
Suicide doors, brown Rover look like pork and beans
Everybody know me in the club, cause they smoking me
Dro, h**s scoping me, ice come from Boca Raton
Hundred karats have 'em froze for an eon
Red, black, and white Chevy, now I'm riding Deion
Put them lights off in my rims, now I'm riding neon
Our cars look like crayon, h**s know I'm the man though
I can shoulder lean, I don't how to dance though

Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean

Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean

First I let my wheels spin, then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat, at Greenbriar Mall, tall
How then I pimp a foe, take a chick to Berlin
My chick break triggas, after that we take that girlfriend
My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Man is a child, it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Benz, cocking hammer, Arm & Hammer propaganda
Man it think I'm pimping in linen and salamander sandals
Dirty South hot cause Atlanta, show killas with ammo
We ride phantoms, holler shorty for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET our channel
Hood playa from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumping and punking monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies
Donut Dunkin, shorty ride glazed on a haze
Gator green Chevy, gator gut, alligator J's

Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step, and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean

Money in the air as mo' fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel, ho sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby say, ""I don't talk Dogg, then she told on me"", oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do?
Baby stick to me, and I'ma stick on you
If you pick me, then I'ma pick on you
D-O double G and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip ridin' the poles and them doors is tight
And I'ma get me a shot 'fo the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy and baby, your pussy for life

Shorty I can see, you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
See you lookin' at me, now what it's gon' be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' 'bout thirty stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move amphetamines
Girl I, spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides, I got a thing for you

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg & Akon]
Mobbin' through the club and I'm low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker's section (Just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby I see you)
Hmm, it's cool, we jet, the mood is set
Your pussy is wet, you're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me

[Verse 4: Akon]
Girl and while you're lookin' at me, I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everything and that's kinda scary
'Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin' got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

[Chorus: Akon]
I see you windin' and grindin' up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know
I wanna love you (Love you) you already know

Ice Cube motherfucker

George Bush, George Clinton, Bill Clinton
Chris Farley, Chris Rock, Bob Marley
Rick James, knew how to throw a party
""Smoke some weed""
Snoop Dogg, all the way to Cheech and Chong
Cypress Hill, Robert Downey hit the bong
Ricky Williams, fuck how Miami feeling
""Smoke some weed""

[Refrain]
This is West coast nigga thinking
California quicksand got a nigga sinking

This is West coast nigga thinking
California quicksand got a nigga sinking
I can give a fuck what you bitches drinking
Smoke some weed

[Verse 1]
If you a baller, nigga I'm a hall of famer
Lion tamer, with two fo'-fifth flamers
Understand, that yo' life's in danger
Didn't your momma, tell you not to talk to strangers
Lil' nigga, I'm the Hillside Strangler
Have a banger, calling for the Lone Ranger
Most rappers, they wanna fuck sangers
I'm a nigga, that wanna own Topanga
G4, pull it up out the hanger
A lil' something, to fuel you niggas anger
The swine, I'm your face rearranger
In a mansion cause Jesus born in a manger
Motherfucker, belong on Jerry Spranger
I'm a gangsta, up in your CD changer
I'll gank ya, for 20 bucks then I'll thank ya
Police, still get the middle fanger

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Lil' niggas, don't try this at home
Momma in the bathroom leave her ass alone
Cause she probably taking chronic straight to the dome
Go play you lil' fucker, stop being grown
Dave Chappelle, 50 million and a throne
With a big Zulu bitch, nigga getting blown
Watch your tone, if your wear Coppertone
Go back to Africa used to be a theme song
I'm in the zone, do anybody got a Zong?
I ain't your poppa, but daddy is a rolling stone
Youse a clone, who don't know the shit you on
Unless it's on, a motherfucking ringtone
I'm in a room with two bottles of Patron
You need a loan, to fuck with the Family Stone
Nigga go on, tell 'em Ice Cube is home
Gorilla niggas, here come King Kong

[Refrain]

Ice Cube motherfucka

And we ain't wit none of that trickin but our bills so tall
I been peepin you fo' a while and you throwin it back
If you lookin fo you a balla, we got dough in da back
Look yo' color carmello brown and your skin so smooth
I'm havin fantasies about what you and me can do
And you an undacover freak, you probably thinking da same
I'm seein light up on yo face, because you peepin my chain
And I ain't tryin put you out thurr, as if you a freak
So don't even take it that way, just say you did it for me
And yeah, you probably ROLL wit me cause it's money in my pockets
So before THEN, I gotta see you pop lock and drop it

I ain't gotta be yo' man, but I really wouldn't mind
We ain't gotta talk again, I'm jus tryna have a time
If you a balla, pull a stack out, and slap her on da ayyy!
Pop lockin cock blockas, get up out da way
Let lil' mami get low, give a space, let her sweat
The club turnin to hoolas cause they shirts is so wet
From da window to da wall, lil' mama showin her thong
The broad, freakin herself, it's tellin me that it's on
You ready then we can roll I'm tellin you we can go
I'm thinkin if I can handle it the way you make it roll
You groovin and speedin up, you right in between us
If you a strip-teaser, then baby don't tease us
At first I thought I was trippin but my vision gettin clearer
You movin that thang around as if you practice in the mirror
""She doin a new, dance,"" what the next man said
I'm like, ""Naw, she just pop lockin on a headstand""

[Verse 1]
I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have super powers
Rap 225 thousand hours
Get it calculated, do the math
I made 1,000 songs that made you move your ass
And for the last 300 months
I made 16 albums with me on the front and they bump
Where you get your beats?
I heard 93 rappers say bitch like me
2 singers and 10 comedians
And I'm still gon' yell it every time you see me in
What's my favorite word?
BITCH!
Why they gotta say it like $hort?
BITCH!
You know they can't play on my court
Can't hang with the big dogs
Stay on the porch

[Chorus]
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

[Verse 2]
Where you get that from?
Grab the mic, spit one, let me hit that blunt
Pimp-C, 8-Ball, and MJG
Keep spittin' that P to the I-M-P
Bun-B, that's Texas, baby
Ball and G, that's Memphis, baby
$hort Dog, that's Oakland, baby
Ain't nothin' but pimpin' these days, G
My nigga C got locked up
But these real hoes still know they gots to fuck
Give a fuck nigga what you say
$hort Dog fuck with UGK
Do you really wanna be like me?
Spit game like Snoop and T.I.P
Pretty girls in the VIP
They came with Dre... they don't need ID

[Chorus]
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

[Verse 3]
Your mind is gone
Your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last 3 days
Poppin' pills
It goes down for real
Don't stop, just keep rollin' down hill
Crash and burn, can't stand, fall back
You're doin' too much, you can't handle all that
Man, it's been way too long
Time to let the whole world play your songs
Like me, my shit gets around
Leave the country, come back, and hit The Town
I'm in Miami, New York, and ATL
Houston and LA, ask Dave Chappelle about my rich bitch
He got it from me
And made 50 million dollars
I'm proud of you D
But I'm crazy you don't wanna be like me
I come from East Oakland where the youngstas get hyphy
Blow it!

[Chorus]
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Bitch!

[Intro]
Yeah, and it go a little somethin'
Li-li-like this

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (Like this)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and NEVER come back

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway runaway love
Don't keep runnin away
I'll run away with you, if you want me to
Lahhhhhhh

[Outro: Ludacris]
Yeah, I can only imagine what you goin through ladies
Sometimes I feel like runnin away myself
So do me a favor right now and close your eyes
And picture us runnin away together
When we come back everything gonna be okay
Open your eyes

Round the globe, atlas
But I need to know ma, you gon' suck it or not?
Babygirl, I'm in love with the twat
Missionary, back shots, pop it off, rock it off
I tell you right now if my cock is soft (what I want?)
Head before and after (what's that?)
Top it off (do what?)
On ya knees, show you how to top a boss (how it go?)
Lick, suck, deep throat, stop, cough
Hop on, hop off, lollipop off
I know it's white, but here come the hot sauce

[Hook]

[Cam'ron]
Lookin light skinned, mami was type slim
Fat ass, big tits, I noticed her nice chin (sturdy chin)
I approached her, slight grin, white Timbs, number you can type in

I just laughed, ma, if we link, we link
You don't like men? me neither, what a coincidink (what a coincidence)
Ms. Jiggy, Ms. Piggy, Pinky mink, pinky ring blingin'
Ma, you gon' suck it or not?
I ain't the type to diss you, kinda like the issue (I like that)
That's the situation, bring wifey with you (bring her)
Would you like a tissue? (Why?)
You gon' need it for the cum in your nose, babygirl, cause you suckin my cock!
Ain't a question now, it's a guarantee
They say I think I'm the shit, (oh well) well apparently
But you won't hear words like ""Marry me"" (what, marry me?)
Only thing you gonna hear is, ""suck it or not!""

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
I get head in the strangest places
Two at the same time, call it changin faces
I tell a bitch ""we ain't tradin places""
Now stand back and catch my amazing graces (Heheh)
Taste and savor it
Vanilla Ice Cream, she say ""ooh, my favorite""
Do you know who you playin' wit?
Wayne
Chillin' like a scarecrow, looking for some brain
Drivin' in the range or
Flying on a plane
Her head is crazy so she's insane
She know the game, get in and get right
Every bitch in the industry wanna rock my mic
I'm hot like light
I'm tough like Ike
I don't fuck with dog hoes cause them hoes might bite
Yeah, and then she follows
In the back of my mind, I'm hopin' she swallows

[Verse 1]
In my mind, I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
An arsenic writer, author with arth-r-itis
Carpal tunnel, Marshall with Start-Shit-Itis
Hardheaded and hotheaded, bullheaded and pigheaded
Dick-headed, a prick, a big headache
I'm sick, quick-witted; for every lyric spitted
There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it
So, quick—this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it
And it's not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling, I'll quit, so stop dwelling!
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
‘Cause I got jelly, like Beyoncé's potbelly
This is destiny; yes, money, I'm off running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

[Verse 2]
My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating, haha!
Fuck, yeah, I'm a basket case
And I'll master this rap shit 'til my ass gets wasted
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation
.44 mag's a fascination
A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then—

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

[Verse 3]
This song isn't for you, it's for me
A true MC, it's what he'll do just to see
If he still has it and if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a—
Real MC, got you feelin' me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast If I ain't had this
Outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding, soaked in self-loathing
And mourning, so I'm warning you: Don't coax me
It's silly, I’m really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be—
Fooled; the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know, ‘cause they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talking 'bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of duking
They can suck my dick while I'm puking
And you, too, you can—

[Outro]
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies

Bow in the presence of greatness

Do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever, hour after hour

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Somethin' special
Unforgettable
50 Cent (Cent)
Justin ('tin)
Timbaland ('land)
Goddamn, damn

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
She, she, she want it, I wanna give it to her
She know that it's right here for her
I wanna see her break it down (Yeah)
I'm ballin', throwing money 'round

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
She a working girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as hell, she 'bout the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money-money, she make it, make it
Look at the way she shake it, shake it
Make you wanna touch it, make you wanna taste it
Have you lusting for it, going crazy, face it
Now don't stop, get it, get it
The way she shake it make you wanna hit it
Think she double-jointed from the way she split it
Got your head fucked up from the way she did it
She so much more than you used to
She know just how to move to seduce you
She gon' do the right thing and touch the right spots
And dance in your lap 'til ou ready to pop

[Bridge: 50 Cent & Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
She always ready, when you want it, she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I'll show you where to meet her
On the late night, 'til daylight, the club jumping
If you want a good time, she gon' give you what you want
Let me talk to you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You got me saying, ""Ayo!"" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you, girl

[Verse 2: 50 Cent; 50 Cent w/ Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that—that there should be 'gainst the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin', shawty, we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Let me talk to you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You got me saying, ""Ayo!"" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Keep runnin' homie
Go, go, go, go, go, go
They on the trail

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Keep runnin' homie
Go, go, go, go, go, go
They on the trail

With so much drama in the industry
Hip hop police are listenin'
Be careful or you'll be history
Looks like another unsolved mystery

It's murda, murda, murda
Ah, it's murda, murda, murda
Yeah, it's murda, murda, murda
Somebody tell â€ em it's murda
Murder was the case and they blamed me

Officer, I didn't do it, you can't blame me for this
Could you please loosen up the handcuffs on my wrists?
You can call me what you wanna mayne, but I ain't a snitch
No cooperation is exactly what you would get

Till I talk to my lawyer, you get no reply
You've obviously been watchin' too much CSI
I'm not a crash dummy so don't even try
To talk your dirty trash to me, no BFI

If you are not guilty of anythin', then why did you run?
Â€ Cause you the police and plus I saw you cockin' your gun
And the chamber wasn't empty, it was obviously one
If you think I'm believin' that one, you're obviously dumb, huh

I know that you heard the sirens
You dived into the vehicle, you was drivin' and ridin'
Instead you shouldn't be whinin' about abidin'
By the law, now it's obvious you're lyin'

With so much drama in the industry
Hip hop police are listenin'
Be careful or you'll be history
Looks like another unsolved mystery

It's murda, murda, murda
Ah, it's murda, murda, murda
Yeah, it's murda, murda, murda
Somebody tell â€ em it's murda
Murder was the case and they blamed me

Stop lyin' to me boy, it'd be best you confess
I can smell the BS on the scent of your breath
Saw the meth while I was inspectin' your deck
Saw that you was ridin' dirty when I looked at the rest

Who is this guy Busta? Who is this guy Snoop?
Who is his other friend who's wearing the sky blue?
Look at this pic here, who's standin' beside you?
Tell me his name now, I heard he was Piru

Confiscated the CD's at one of your homes
For evidence ever since we heard some of your songs
What about this Pimp guy, he was on one of your songs
I could've sworn that he said, he had a pocket full of stones

Am I wrong? Hell yeah, I don't know who that is
I don't know no Pimp C, all I know is I'm rich
And I'ma bond like James, bet I be out here quick, man
You ain't gettin' out of here, you must think that your slick

In the car we confiscated The Chronic and The Clipse
Diary that you had and all your blueprints
On the death row booklet, we found your two prints
Your thumb and your index, the judge will love this

With so much drama in the industry
Hip hop police are listenin'
Be careful or you'll be history
Looks like another unsolved mystery

It's murda, murda, murda
(It's a bloody murder)
Ah, it's murda, murda, murda
(It's a bloody murder)
Yeah, it's murda, murda, murda
(It's a bloody murder)
Somebody tell 'em it's murda
Murder was the case and they blamed me

Now you can see you're screwed as the evidence pours in
The witness to the crime was at 3 in the mornin'
Gave us a description so we picked up your boy and
You'll get a lighter sentence if you put the crime on him

A big celebrity, a case we long for
You a pirate, why you got that eyepatch on for?
Funny puttin' people in a hearse what I heard for
Where were you the night of April 21st son? Home

I think that you got your facts wrong, gats on you
Chamillionaire, Rob, Chuck, couple cats on Melview, what?
We gonna have to jail you too
In the line up, don't speak until we tell you to

This the person who jimmied your lock, sir?
Was dark, kinda looked like him, I'm not sure
Failin' to nail â€ cause assailant's another
Believe I see an unmarked tail in the rubber

Hit the Bodega, not no more game
This chick used to be nice, actin' all strange
Like she was gonna get it, pathetic
I sell in court now they all apologetic

With so much drama in the industry
Hip hop police are listenin'
Be careful or you'll be history
Looks like another unsolved mystery

It's murda, murda, murda
Ah, it's murda, murda, murda
Yeah, it's murda, murda, murda
Somebody tell â€ em it's murda
Murder was the case and they blamed me

Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual
She was flexible,
Professional,

Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I whoa
Did I think I seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm making it snow
Work the pole I gotta bank role

Cadillacs laid back for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack (come on), two stacks (come on), three stacks (come on)
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man
I'll bend the rubber bands
That's when I threw her legs on my shoulders
I knew it was over
That heny and Cola got me like a soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky, oh me, I was just like clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her

Whoa, shawty yeah she was worth the money
Little mama took my cash

Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack

[Intro: Wish Bone]
Bone Thugs, Akon, yeah
You know, don't nothin' come easy
You gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard
But I guess I gotta try harder

[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
First let me explain that I'm just a black man
And I come from the dark side
So I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man
My mind be racin' and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
So I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really I'm wrong
Then again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane chasin' my dreams
And then it seem when the fame and cash came
They just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately
I've been so faded tryin' to erase it
But I just can't ‘cause the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later

[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
It's like I'm takin' five steps forward and ten steps back
Tryin' to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close?
And uh, I just don't know but I be out here fightin' demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord, would you help me?
And stop this pain I keep inflictin' on my family?
Hustlin' and gamblin', trickin' and scramblin'
And losin' sight of what I'm supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage ‘cause everyday's a challenge
And man, I'm slippin', can't lose my balance, I'm tryin' not to panic

[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
I see that things won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it keeps pullin' me back, mane
Got me doin' dirty dirt
So used to this hustlin' money
That I don't understand no 9-to-5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us
I'm tryin' to make it to that major league
So we will never leave until the sun came up
Gotta get it—no, nope, not leavin' no budge
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to
Try so hard but I won't pull through

[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Chorus: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me or you could catch one in your wig
You see the Testarossa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line then nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal, an infantry I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playing
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the nine
Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine
I let twenty-one shots off at the same time, yeah

[Chorus: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Yeah, where I'm from death is always in the air, homie
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creeping through the hood wearing Teflon
Hit the corners, motherfuckers get left on
Niggas know, if not, they better check my background
Try and stick me I'll fill your back with MAC rounds
Ask Preme, nigga, 50 don't back down
I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house
Cross the line, boy, I'ma air ya ass out
Screw your face at me I wanna know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad, I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk, but I don't know these niggas
And I ain't did no business with 'em, I don't owe these niggas
A minute of my time, I get it cause I grind
All across the globe like the world's mine, yeh

[Chorus: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 3: Akon]
Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
And seen a MAC aiming at your head, man?
Before you know it life is flashing, reminiscing
And your body is dripping and full of lead, mane
I done been there, I done copped that
It ain't never been a question, I'm bout that
Don't go there, you get clapped at
And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that
You'll never catch me riding around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggas
50 don't make me ride on these niggas
'Cause I be long gone like The Ripper so

[Chorus: Akon]
Oh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nothing changed, still holla at my homies
Oh, and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga, but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggas get to fucking around
If niggas get to fucking around

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ugh, I'm getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I say anything I don’t mean
Like, ""what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me""
And, ""What's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?""
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah, and I be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Tripping off you, 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tan and my hair long and my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work, but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking—watch me take it

[Bridge: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done

Ugh! I’m burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest (Ugh)
I bury the most cash and burning the rest (Stuntin')
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air (Yeah)
The ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear (Check it)
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on your neck and tell you, ""Everything is great"" (Right)
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing eight
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully (Haha)
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams (Woo!)
In a room full of money out in London as she screams? (Woo!)
Ugh! Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So, yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double-M G until I get the chair, chyeah

I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money ain't enough money
You know the feds listening—nigga, what money?
I’m a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused, might as well say ""cheese"" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sellout, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration, bitches: Mazel tov
It’s a slim chance I fall: Olive Oyl

Even when we not freaking you be on my mind
I'm on the top I'm flipping them dimes

Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ringtoooone
Shaaaaaaw-ty - sang it to me girl!

[Plies]
Soon as I seen her, shieet, told her I'd pay for it
Lil' mama the baddest thing 'round here, she already know it
I pointed at the donk and told her, ""This s'posed to be yours"" (ha ha!)
Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga n' she went for it
First time I caught her shit, she ain't even kno' how to tho'it back
Now she a animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her, ""I'on't usually do this, I'on't fuck on the first night
Cause after I beat ya baby, I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life!""
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil' bust-it baby, cause she keep it tight
Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice
Whatever I wanna get off, she know how to get me right

[Hook: T-Pain]

Look how dat pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bowlegged and bend the co'ner
She proud to be fuckin me, cause I'm stuntin on 'em!
It feel good to be fuckin a real nigga, do'nuh?
Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin 'er off, cause she ain't with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil' mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause I done beat her hunda
Babe snatchin, not now, I'm tellin ya, I promise!
I exposed her to real and now she hate lame

She call me sometimes just to ask is it her thang
Ever since I ran up in shawty, she ain't been the same

[Intro: Connie Mitchell]
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like ""love to start shit""
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you, Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi

[Chorus: Dwele & Connie Mitchell]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
What do I know? Know
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thang
I know I was foul, baby
Ayy, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

[Chorus: Dwele & Connie Mitchell]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know?
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
What do I know? Know
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)

[Outro: Dwele & Connie Mitchell]
As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know?
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
What do you know? Know
Flashing lights (Lights, lights)
Flashing lights (Lights, lights, lights, lights...)

I got rid of my old bitch; now, I got new hoes (Woo!)
First, it was the Benzo; now, I'm in the Enzo
Ferrari—I'm sorry, I keep blowing up (Oh!)
They call me the cake man, the strawberry-shake man
I spray the AR, make your whole clique breakdance (Yeah)
Backspin, head-spin, flatline, you're dead, then
Nine shells, Mac-10—who wan' get it cracking?
I was young, I couldn't do good; now, I can't do bad
I ride, wreck the new Jag? I just buy the new Jag
Now, nigga, why you mad?
Oh, you can't do that? I'm so forgetful
They calling me cocky
I come up out the jeweler, they calling me Rocky
It's the ice on my neck, man, the wrist and my left hand
Bling like ""Blaow!, you like my style
Ha, ha! I'm heading to the bank right now

In the hood if you ask about me
They'll tell ya I'm about my bread (I, I get it)

Don't get excited I've been invited to the quiet storm
And, now it's out of hand cause she told me she hate me
And then she said what the hell I done lately

Let me be your angel, and I'll be your protection
Took her out bought her all kinds of things
But it wasn't enough, so this the song I sing cause she broke

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah
And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Kanye West]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Hook: T-Pain (Fabolous) {J.D.}]
I try to play cool
Actin like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin at home, all alone
Tryin to keep myself from goin crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}
I want my baby back! {'Lo-so} And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't) {y'all know what this is}

[Fabolous]
Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin to scream about just back your Bimmer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to key my house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'mma slide (yup)
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay

[Hook: T-Pain (Fabolous) {unlisted J.D. ad libs}]

[Fabolous]
Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne
Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

[Hook]

[Fabolous]
Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin, it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up
We already straight - yesss

[Hook]

[Jermaine Dupri]
Fab we gon' have to make a dance to this song man!
Y'knahmean; ain't no WAY you can't dance on this

She might be with him but she's thinking 'bout me, me, me

I was all in da club, havin' a drink, blowin' on a sweet
When I peeped this little freak out
I was all in the bar, wind drift up, Shawty Redd came on
Then she hit the floor, now
With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home, with them real big hips
You so right I'm gon' beat
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, ""Lil' mama, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak but you know that I ain't gon' say shh""
See my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it was no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

Sensual seduction
Sensual seduction, whoa

Sexual eruption

[Intro: Lil Jon]
Yeah
I used to think about immature things
You know, like, ""Do you love me? Do you want me?
Are you gon' call me like you said you would?
Is this really your real phone number?""
Wait a minute motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Ain't a hood nigga, but a nigga from the hood
See, mama stayed on me so I turned out pretty good
But if you wanna try, sucker now then we can do it
Ha-ha, sleep, Tylenol PM if I pull it
Sh-sh-sheep, count 'em for the rest of ya life
Yeah, yeah your partner got away, but now he vegetable-like
So-so I sent his mom and dad a whole case of V8
He can die any second, how much longer it's 'gon take?
Go and get it over with, oh, what if you were in my loafers then?
You might be the dope, but I would flush it down the toilet
Like the boys in blue when they come through with them boots
And they kickin' down the door and they don't care who they shoot
But we do care who they shoot, so we do what we must do
So we act like we run track, then we run straight to the back
But they comin' from the back, so we run back to the front
They say get down on ya knees, we say, ""What the fuck you want?""
They want cheese, they want bread, they want dough, they want mo'
Than I wanna give 'em, but if I keep talkin' they won't know
That my cousin in the back, and we call him Roto-Rooter
Slash plumber, cash runner and he fire on them computers, log out

[Chorus: Rich Boy]
Fuck niggas wanna jack, shit tight
No slack, just bought a Cadillac, throw— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some— throw some Ds on that bitch

Just bought a Cadillac, throw some Ds on that bitch

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Shout out to Rich Boy, we all wanna be rich, boy
Alabama bricks boy tryin' to get them big toys
Two-twelve motorin', tell Harry throw some Ds on that bitch
Now I'm gettin' fly, couple Gs on the fit
I'm at the jeweler now, throw some freeze on a bitch
I got a chest cold and I might sneeze on the bitch
We at the strip club, we throw some Gs on that bitch 'cause we ballin'
We all outcasts, hot cars, we coppin' cash
Chop shop, the added stash, cop cars can kiss my ass
The car wash, my whip's glowin', no tints, we fish bowlin'
No top, the piff's blowin', throw some Ds on that bitch
And we go hard, Zone 4, d-boy squad
We don't need the bars, kosher's lawyer, baby, just to beat the charge
We got a fetish coppin' speedy cars, charge it to my Visa card
They never thought that we'd get large (Yo)

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee & Nelly]
Lunatics sittin' fat, St. Louis on the map
Sixty-nine wet black, I just got my Cutty back
Throw some Ds on that ho, I just got my Cutty back
Throw some Ds on that ho, I just got my Cutty back
How could I slip, how could I fall
When you're baby mama got my poster high up on her wall?
And that ain't all, she done gave me them drawers
I'm Murphy Lee, please tell your sexy little sister I called
Last time she asked me for some money, I was hell to the nah
But now I'm rich and she can get it
See these Ds match my fitted, my paint is banana splitted
Inside is totally ig'nant, outside is totally kitted
To be specific it's wicked how them Derrty Boyz did it
That Buick Regal, done did it, my Monte Carlo's terrific
That El Dorado got switches, Tamika and them, I done hit it
That twenty mill', I done spent it, that house on the hill, I live it
And that diamond herringbone? (You know them niggas did it)
Walk up in the strip club, lookin for a big butt
Shawty wanna get fucked, I brought about ten, what?
Throw throw some ones on 'em Mo, I brought about ten, what?
Throw throw some ones on 'em Mo, I brought about ten, what?

[Chorus: Rich Boy]
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack, shit tight
No slack, just bought a Cadillac, throw— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac (Let's go), ayy

[Verse 4: Rich Boy]
It's Rich Boy, baby girl, I'm a baller
I dropped a hit and had to go park my Impala
I threw some Ds on that 'Lac and now it's taller
They see the wheels on my de Ville and so they holla
Let's get this dollar, I got the fat man 'Lac
Took it to the paint shop and got the fat man black
I hold my jacket with my Tokyo Adidas on
Ho, don't even call my phone if you ain't gonna give me dome
So fuck you haters, I'll see you later
Might see the gator in my Escalade, uh
Mama told me, ""Put some Ds on it, son, you ridin' wrong""
So I took them twenties off and put the monster wheels on

[Verse 5: The Game]
All red Chevrolet, twenty-sixes ridin' high
Dukes of Hazzard doors, in Compton we call 'em suicides
Suede roof, leather seats, woodgrain steering wheel
Candy apple hard-top, Game logo on the grill
California license plate ridin' through the ATL
Keep my tires bald, I never leave a paper trail
Nah, I'ma keep it clean, ball when I hit the scene
Elbow out the window, show 'em how to gangsta lean
Put Cali on the map, west side on my back
Hometown on my face, forty-five on my lap
Twenty in my earlobe, hundred on my neck piece
Just bought a Bentley, nigga, and I'ma throw some Ds on that bitch
Pull up at the rim shop and throw some Ds on that bitch
Might as well cut the top
Let the sunshine in and the bass jump out
Hit the block, fifteens vibratin' the whole fuckin' house

[Chorus: Rich Boy]
Rich Boy sellin' crack, fuck niggas wanna jack, shit tight
No slack, just bought a Cadillac, throw— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac, throw some— throw some Ds on that bitch
Just bought a Cadillac

When we touch down, (in the Midwest we okay
E'rybody know them southern boys love that bass)
Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, 'weesiana
Mississippi, Ten-a-keys, every muh'fuckin' state
When we touch down
(Go right from the plane to the Range)
When we touch down
(On a private plane, gettin' brains, 'til we)
Touch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady, baby
We 'bout to incite a riot when we touch down

[Verse 1: T.I.]
When we get in town, you know how we gettin' down
Pull up clean, then we hop on out
Snatch all the freaks, then walk on out
I'm livin' what they talking 'bout, shinin' if it dark or not
That one hundred E-X-double R
You'll find that in the parkin' lot
You barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three
Four, five and six as well as one, Atlanta I'm forever, son
Still be on whatever coke, ridin' blowin' heavy smoke
Aye, Em, you better tell them folk, won't hesitate to let 'em go
They know I put that green light on them haters
Keep on tryin' me, I put that beam right on your tater (pow!)
Now you don't wanna see T.I.P. outrageous
Try to keep him in a cage, but somehow he keep escapin'
That's why I be on vacation, Virgin Island I be takin'
Private planes out to Spain, I keep on flyin', I ain't fakin'
The money ain't a thang, think I'm lyin', you're mistaken
You can find long lines of all kinds of bitches waitin'

Welcome to the Midwest, yes, where them Detroit playas ball
Like you have no idea, the boy is here
Got the whole place looking like it's candy painted
Ain't it like we left the kids at home
And just let 'em loose with the crayons?
Fuck, I just hit a jogger, people lookin' like Frogger
They hoppin' out of the way
Whenever they see Marshall's car comin'
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker
And let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin'
But I'm bound to bump into somethin'
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they krumpin'
The way they tumblin', I gotta do somethin'
But as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off
They just right back at it tomorrow
They're like, ""Dad, this is in, so you're with the trends.""
""This is for the pimps
Listening to Mims, nail polish on the rims.""
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show
So go on with your bad self, just have it back to normal

From my arrival, until my departure
Guarantee I put this d-i-c-k in somebody daughter
Aye, I still have my way with the ladies way cross the water
Flew to Paris from Haiti, did some shit that I thought of
It's ironic that the shit that we poppin' makes us psychotic
Then treaten corporate America
That's why they runnin' from me
How could they be so ignorant?
Look what hip-hop done brung us!
It's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys
Got us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me
So excuse me, Oprah, honey, I'm sorry, really I promise
But niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just bein' honest
For that am I being punished? Why is you so astonished?
Now, I ain't got a degree, just intelligence in abundance
So you ain't gotta like me, I know billions of folks who love me
You can tell how they yellin' and screamin' and waiting for me

Where the hood at? (Huh)
Where the hood at? (Uh-huh)
YMCMB (Rozay!)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school Chevys
24′s so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood, they outside playing hopscotch
And everybody know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hood, them boys will put you down on your knees
(Woop, woop) That's the sound of the police
In my hood

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Audemar on my wrist, diamonds look like they glowing
50 stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing
Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin'
Treat them like jack boys, catch them slipping then slay them
Lord, forgive me for my sins
That's my confessions, if they put me in this Benz
I got possession of a federal offense
I'm talking pressure in my criminal intent
So wear ya vests and I'm still gon' stunt like it ain't no tomorrow
Fuck ya house note, nigga, blow that bitch on a bottle
The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo in the back
Tell you “We The Best forever"", DJ Khaled handle that (huh)

In my hood

[Verse 2: Plies]
I know some niggas from my hood that would rob Noriega
I’m talkin’ Noriega, nigga, the real Noriega
If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us
And tell Congress when you see 'em, bitch, I'm stealin' cable
And leave the D-Boys alone cause they motivate us
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers?
Some are on house arrest, some are on child support
Some of them did they bid, the other half waiting to go to court
Mr. Landlord, we gon' bust your ass with an eviction note
Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo
I'm talking strip clubs, I'm talking liquor stores
We throw our money round here, but y'all can

Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it

In my hood

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Bitch, I’m on probation, so my nerves bad
And they say time flies, well mine’s first class
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets
I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach
Back from hell, cell 23
Tell the warden kiss my ass, pockets on Monique
Bitch I’m from the murder capital, ho, I’m far from practical
Shit happens and since I’m the shit, I’m who it happens to
Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I’m red hot
I don’t see nobody, see no body like a head shot
All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out
Got it sewn up, check the thread count
(Young Mula baby, YMCMB, Khaled I gotcha!)

[Chorus: T-Pain & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to my hood, everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it
Welcome to my hood, look at all these old school Chevys
24′s so you know we roll heavy
Welcome to my hood, they outside playing hopscotch
And everybody know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hood, them boys will put you down on your knees
Woop, woop (I say fuck the) police

Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test

Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation

Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning and—
Good morning!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Good morning and look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach this, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that you received this

Your wife on the futon hugging that Shih Tzu
Homie, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo' fifths and bananas on the K's
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made fifty mill, Em got paid
When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid
I ain't even gotta rap now, life is made
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy, mane

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

[Verse 2]
I keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold
Got it off the street movin bundles and O's
Seventy Three Caprice old school when I roll
Breeze pass with the E-Pass, fuck the toll
No more platinum, I'm wearing gold
I'm internationally known as the kid with the flow
That brings enough dough, it's never enough though
Shit I need mo', new shit out the sto'
Baby blue was old, fresh off the flo'
Stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war
Make the purple bring the green in, fuck the law
I'm oh so raw, I'm hot, I'm sure
I'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe, boy
I set the club on fire I told ya
I'm the general; salute me soldier

[Chorus]
I'm laughing straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

Now work it out now, shorty work it out
I wanna see you, break it down
Now back it up now, you know what I'm about
It's like a bank job I'm in and I'm out
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Ugh, ugh, yessir!
Just the sound of his voice is a hit
Hehe
Y'all niggas got me really confused out there
I make ""Big Pimpin'"" or""Give It 2 Me,"" one of those, y'all hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
I make some thought-provoking shit, y'all question whether he fallin' off
I'ma really confuse y'all on this one
Follow!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block, then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged, then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
""That's him!""—I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he with, or his chip amount
'Cause I been doing this since CHiPs was out
Watchin' Erik Estrada baggin' up at the Ramada
Table full of powder, A/C broke
'Bout to take another shower, on my 25th Hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game or the fight
You might see me anywhere, a day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no sixes on Sprees
Laid-back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This is that ignorant shit you like
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you love
Nigga, fuck, shit, maricón, puta, and drugs, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you need
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus weed, c'mon
I'm only tryna give you what you want
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, you like it—don't front!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
They're all actors
Lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
Can't even face themselves
Don't fear no rappers
They're all weirdos, De Niros in practice
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures
It's mostly backwards
Unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song, you happen to see
Then, actually, believe half of what you see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
And with that said, I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell
Shoot niggas straight through the ER, whoa!
This ain't B.R., no
It's S.C., CEO, the next Lyor
No, the next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel—go!

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Ugh, take off the cuffs, unlock the gate
It's that ignorant nigga that you love to hate
The '07 Ice Cube, B. Sig' so rude
Tell a trick, get these nuts, eat dick like food
Now see if I care if this verse get aired
Even if you mute it, the curse is there, yeah
I'm so raunchy, bitch, get off me
Keep my flea collar on, you lil' ticks get off me

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
I missed the part when it stopped being 'bout Imus
What do my lyrics got to do with this shit?
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Are you saying what I'm spitting is worse than these celebretantes showin' they kitten? You kidding?
Let's stop the bullshittin'
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin'
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Let's stop the bullshittin'
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin', c'mon

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This is that ignorant shit you like
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you love
Nigga, fuck, shit, maricón, puta, and drugs, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you need
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus weed, c'mon
I'm only tryna give you what you want
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, you like it—don't front!

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Saying that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-see 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no looking back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling, ""Too soon!
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
Ature on the subject; you sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty, we'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry, hurry, go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp, remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Ayy, keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part, play your part""

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
(Sweet Jones)
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with forty dollars in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch, it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, I choose you girl, yeah

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Baby, you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl, I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile (mile)
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
'Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable (fable)
We rocking Russian sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
'Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes?
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, I choose you girl, yeah

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick, or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit', girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
'Cause it's gonna get wetter, better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby, but we see she don't
Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it
Slaughter-slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
'Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
'Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up (shit)

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, I choose you girl, yeah
Ahh, I choose you baby...

[Jermaine Dupri]
Y'all know what this is

[Hook]
When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds you can hardly hear me speak
Specially when it sound like this, this
It's the H-Town baby and you know what it is
I'm throwed
Got a styrofoam cup full o' barre
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Chokin' Cali while I'm bangin' the Screw
It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do
I'm throwed

[Paul Wall]
Fresher than a fruit bowl
Leanin' like a gas gauge
Straight up off the dome
Freestylin' like hair braids
Makin' that candy dance
I'm throwed off the Cali plants
I'm prancin' on the scene crawlin' down like fire ants
My mind in a trance
I'm sharper than starched pants
Stackin' Franklins and Grants from South Bank to Spring Branch
I'm posted like a stamp with my mind on cash
I'm wheel grippin' and still tippin' brandy wine on glass
I got a screen in the dash
A quarter-tank full of gas
Smokin' that puff puff pass
Throwed I hope I don't crash
Reppin' that Swisha Blast, so I'm flyer than a mockin' bird
Throwed in the mode, game cold as a iceberg, baby

[Hook]
When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds you can hardly hear me speak
Specially when it sound like this, this
It's the H-Town baby and you know what it is
I'm throwed
Got a styrofoam cup full o' barre
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Chokin' Cali while I'm bangin' the screwed
It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do
I'm throwed

[Paul Wall]
Now with the broads, I'm a sharp shooter like Steve Kerr
Flash the wrist, cause a glare, fox fur, and flyin' spur
Undisputed for sure, so I'm collectin' these dimes
Name and number lil mama cus it's check out time
I'm slidin' on glass threes inhalin' the chronic trees
Pack protection cus playa hatin' spread like STDs
I'm cool as an ocean breeze
Like Chester I'm chasing cheese
I'm stangin' like buzzin' bees
On South Lee with the G's
Screens fall like autumn leaves
Make the TVs rain
Take a picture if you please
Yeah, my wrist is the same
30 carat diamond chain so ballin' is off the chain
Mind frame: I'm stackin' change
I'm so throwed in the game

[Hook]
When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds you can hardly hear me speak
Specially when it sound like this, this
It's the H-Town baby and you know what it is
I'm throwed
Got a styrofoam cup full o' barre
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Chokin' Cali while I'm bangin' the screwed
It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do
I'm throwed

[Paul Wall]
Cup full of that purple Sprite
And I'm searchin' for broads
Paper stackin' so my money stretch like extension cords
I'm a widebody rocker and a foreign on choppers
I'm on the grind stackin' up my mail like the post office
Movin' at slow pace with T-Ferris my ace
Cup full of expensive taste
Open mouth and showcase
I'm throwed with screens hangin' swangin' breakin' the struts
We pourin' up in them cups that stuff got me leanin' tough
Hold up
I'm caked up so all the boppers attract
I got 'em like a soccer mile out there runnin' the track
Pullin' capers makin' paper stacks fly as a dove
A bread breaker, taste maker, baby
All of the above
I'm throwed

[Hook]
When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds you can hardly hear me speak
Specially when it sound like dis, dis
It's the H-Town baby and you know what it is
I'm throwed
Got a styrofoam cup full o' barre
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Chokin' Cali while I'm bangin' the screwed
It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do
I'm throwed

Shawty I need to see somebody do that
That southside one time

You look good in them high heels girl
You're so hood, we in our lil' world
Shoppin sprees overseas, you and me on a private flight
Got a chance to be my wife if ya ass act right
Gotta dance all night girl, you want that ice
Everythang's on me, yeah, I'm that type
Marble floors in these elevator doors
Sixteen bedrooms and all of 'em yours
Let's fuck all night, any position you like
Thick coats by the Coach, black Bentley Azure
I know sometimes a nigga might not make it home and it's
No reception, low bars, it ain't on and I
Keep doin this cause you don't care
Material girl that'll always be there, ya ain't goin nowhere

[Hook: LaToiya Williams]
Time and time I try to leave
But I just can't seem to leave yo' ass alone
Don't know why I can't let you go
And why I keep comin back for mo'

Got me up out the hood, but I'm so confused
And I don't know how much more of this
Disrespect I can take from youuuuu

And ya ain't goin nowhere, how I know because I told you so
And all that cryin shit stop when I'm down below
Shit, I'm on top when you hit that O

Damn, shorty's so flexible
We can do it on the highway, I'm talkin 'bout sex to go
Now how the fuck we get to Mexico?
Yeah I bought that house, but now you talkin 'bout leavin
You don't wanna do that girl it's pleasin season
Heard your girls told you I'm fuckin up and that you need to get even
But all you need is me, you don't need them
You know the game, maintain and do ya thang
And tell them bitches worry 'bout they own man
So when they start talkin like dat dere
Tell them bitches get the fuck out your ear, cause you ain't goin nowhere

But on some real shit, quit bitch, you love this dick
And even if she did leave because of the way I act
It be's like that, fuck it she'll be right back
You and I both know, if you and I both go
Our separate ways one thing's for sho'
If you ever get the nerve to pack your shit and walk up out that do'
You ain't never comin back no mo'
She ain't goin nowhere

Let's go, remix, remix, remix
(Where ya hood at) Remix!
(Where ya hood at) Remix!
(Where ya hood at) Remix!

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled, & Ludacris]
Welcome to my hood
Everybody know everybody
And if I got it everybody got it, ugh
Welcome to my hood
Look at all these old school Chevys
24s, so you know we roll heavy, ugh! (Y, M, C, M, B!)
Welcome to my hood
Where they gettin' fly like a G6
And everybody know this is the remix
Welcome to my hood (Miami-Dade County, 305)
Them boys will put you down on yo knees
We The Best Music
(Woop, woop!) That’s the sound of the police in my hood
Stop playin' wit em! Luda!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Everybody on the corner with the work
Slangin' and bangin' in front of that liquor store (Oh!)
Blowin' money 'cause I live life fast
With this bottle full of 'gnac, I'ma sip this slow (Oh!)
Singles double when triple-beams take over
Now holler 'cause these Impalas got extreme makeovers (Woo!)
Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the street now
Wear the wrong color, catch a Rodney King beatdown
Kids hit with switches, mamas is quotin' scriptures
While Luda's getting head, more gums than baby pictures (Woo!)
Cock my .40 Glock and my partner just bought a replica
Now Asians sayin' they don't keep no cash in they register
(Hurry up and buy!)
We run from red and blue lights to get that green
But whoever got that white is winning like Charlie Sheen! (Woo!)

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Hey! Teddy Pain (Teddy Pain) Bad man (Bad man)
Mix shots, boom-(boom)-boom-(boom)-boom-(bang)!
Man, we the best, never the less, you know we get it hot
Fire (flame, flame), fire—fire (flame)

When I do it, how I do it, what I do (Do)
If a nigga really wanna test (Come and test)
You can bet that I'ma eat 'em all day (Fuck food!)

Talla-home Florida president ('Sent)
Me and DJ Khaled got these haters lookin' hesitant, yeah (Oww)
So keep all that wackness out my ear

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you niggas got your ringside seats
'Cause it's whoop-ass season

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
(Coming to a hood near you!)
Everybody know what happen
When you see me comin' (Back up!)
I be hurdling and got you regurgitating
And murdering everything (Gunshots!)
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop
(Y'all know what it is!) I'm coming to get it
And others are blocking
I'm runnin' the hood and can't nothin' come top it
You can Google it and you can search it (Oooooh!)
On how a nigga come and unlock it
Impossible for you to stop it (Damn!)
(More fire 'pon di place!) Now go and heed the villain
You're like, ""He's injured"" and prob'ly need a medical situation
Because the way I'm fuckin' everything up 'til the people dead
Why you tryna do it? You already know that I'm the king with it
And, you don't wanna come behind me with it, bro! (Hunh!)
I killed this shit! I ain't gotta rhyme no more, man! Tch!

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 4: Twista & Mavado]
Welcome to my hood
Where board members and faculty backin' me
If you ever try attackin' me
That could be when I eat 'em, especially when I beat 'em
When they see a bunch of killas and hustlas on the side of me
I'm an anomaly to 'em, put 'em on crutches
With succulent verses, I'm just the one that's kicking the ruckus
Munch as I smoke a Dutchess, and model bitches that cut us
And motherfuckers that love us, and enemies wanna touch us
I'ma spit a flow as if it was a sin (Haha, what!)
Then the gangstas are resting up forever (Ah...)
See a silent four-, put it on the fin (What!)
Then you know to never test him
It'll be a category F5 (Ayyy)
Handle military with automatic weapons, so let's ride (I...)
Love to the Hundreds, and everybody that runnin' them north
And the whole city, and I'm from the westside (Wan', today)

[Verse 5: Mavado]
Welcome to the gully where we no take bad up
Big spliff in ah mi hand (Haha) and Hennessy in ah mi cup
You see the gyaldem we have up is like some angels abduct
Them fat-tongue, grabba, yah hear me? Haha
When you pass the gate, written at the entrance
""Violate: Straight death sentence""
To live, you must be great; to be a snake, no repentance
We coming at you with vengeance

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 6: DJ Khaled]
Never slippin', I'm ballin', Puff keep on callin'
I don't see none of you pussies (I ain't tryna hear that shit)
Fuck that shit you be talkin'
Rep Miami, the ghettos (Dade County)
Every hood and the projects
And when I drop off my singles
I'm droppin' one of my targets (Tsssss)
Lord, forgive me for my sins (God, forgive me)
I gave you hits—I gave you ""All I Do Is Win"" (I won't stop)
I live this shit
And We The Best, it’s no pretend (I'm for real about this)
I'm touching millions, throwin' hundreds in this bitch

Knock-knock, you hear the Glock cock
And that thing pop on that four-four (Brr-r-rat!)
Posted on it, that same block
I'm in the droptop with that bankroll
Young—Young nigga, I'm out here
Can't name a place that I can't go
Ridin' round with 'bout fifty grand
And they wonder, ""What do that safe hold?""
Middle finger them Feds
And that's what I pledge—a part of my G code
And it's fuck them prosecutors; hustler, connoisseur
It's We The Best Forever
Make sure you spread the rumor, bitch

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 9: Fat Joe]
Good coke, hard rock, stashed in the body shop
Only way to break them bricks down is karate chops
Niggas gettin' left right in front of the Marble precinct
Leave 'em like them Jordans, red-dot, leakin'
I'm fifteen when I first startin' coppin' pies
You 46 just turnin' Blood? Stop it, Five
It's like the only way to make it is supplyin' things
Hoop dreams, dunkin' over cars, let the choir sing

[Verse 10: Game]
Yo, it’s that black raw, black dawg
Pullin' up on that black Hog
Compton, that's my backyard
That's where I used to get them sacks off
But now I got platinum plaques in the back of the 'Bach
And I'm back with Dre again
Aftermath, We The Best, me and Khaled, Dre and Em
Detox, RED, that's back to the back
Step in the club with my hat to the back
Nigga, I'm so hood even though I'm living good
Niggas still in the VIP strapped with a gat
Drop a couple stacks, then, it's back to the trap
Couple hoes in the back, red wheels on the 'Lac
REDRUM if you try it; nigga, it's Westside!
Throw it up! Now!

Savin' every dime (Yeah), tryna choke a quarter
And they ain't sellin' crack (Nah), they sellin' coke and water (Woo)
Smokin' or ya snortin' (Ahh), they coppin' all the Jordans (Yeah)
Nothing's more important, steal 'em if you can't afford 'em (Yup)
I'm gettin' to the money (Money), I need another comma
Some of 'em love the drama (Yeah)
More than they love they mama, ugh!

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 12: Bun B & Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah! Welcome to the land of the trill
Well, everybody walkin' with they hand on they steel
And the model is a supply and demand, and at will
You been outta line with the wrong man and get killed
When you damned if you will, damned if you won't
Lot of dudes sayin' that they can, but they don't
And a lot of boys sayin' that they Gs, but they ain't
Mess around, get laid down in the paint
Better do what you say, say what you do
'Fore I come around your hood, broad day, with the crew
They got them [?], ARs and Ks with 'em, too
And they will gladiate all day, what it do! (what it do)
R.I.P. to the trillest that did it
To my Gs on lockdown, acquitted
Stick with it, think I'ma stop reppin' PAT, forget it
RIVERDALE! Waka! Flocka! Waka! Flocka!

[Verse 13: Waka Flocka Flame]
Welcome to Clayton County (Ugh! Ugh!)
My house got surrounded (Ugh! Ugh! Flocka!)
Enemies tryna drown me
But my hood still around me (RIVERDALE!)
Rookie of the year (Yeah!), no Freshmen cover
Shawty 16 years old, with four baby mothers (Flocka!)
First rapper ever to jump off the stage on BET (Uh-huh)
And since Pac go to Hollywood to keep it street (Ugh!)
First Woo to put T. Rodgers on the TV (Flocka!)
Every day is a party on Grove Street

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

[Chorus]
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless? (How, how?)
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

On and on and on and on

Ay... this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

She like to spell her name wit her tongue on my chest
If you'da told me it was this good, I'da never guessed
She full of surprises, I don't know what she'll do next
But while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out, she shut down the whole set
Love to see her in heels wit the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own checks
My BUST IT BA-BY, I keep her on deck

Baby Phat, just relax, front your own flat screen
Back rub, cook, clean and don't make her make a scene
When you call her on her cellular, she tell you she don't need
Not a goddamn thang, you a hot damn thang
If you think you finna get her with a goddamn chain
You insane, boy you better get some goddamn change
She a fool, been to school, even walked across the stage
And she say, ""I love Webbie from his looks to his ways""
The stilettos the J's depend on how the weather look
Flip flop slippers just to show off the pedicure
Flip flop niggas depend on how the cheddar look
She'll buy her own, I don't think she'll never look
In a man face standin waitin for him to take care of her
She'll rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule

She don't neva trip, all she want is that dick
She bouncy, flossy, keep them hoes off me
Gutta, lil slang, man I love when she talkin
A independent chick, do you know what that mean?
She cook, she clean, never smell like onion rings
22's on her whip, oh she do it large (she do it large)
When she break a nigga off, got a nigga spoiled
She a bad lil chick, a fly lil chick
Hit me on my phone, she like to buy that dick
Got her stunna shades on, lookin like something
Stallion, hair long, she a nice something
Like to go to the mall every day for a outfit
Hair did, nails did, independent what she call it

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
Boosie Badazz
She got her own house, drive her own whip

Only time she need a man for that good joog
They buy the bar too, they superstars too
They be like, ""You ain't got no money? Take yo broke tail home""
In Baby Phat they on, they clothes match they phone
They be like ""Yeah!"" when they song come on
Leave the club kinda early cause they gotta go to work
I mess with supervisors who got credit like Big Turk
So dusty feet, please don't bother me
I got independent dimes on my mind who spoil me
Gucci hat, Gucci fit so sick
That's a gift from my independent chick, yessir!
Tryna get next to her, gotta be ya self, mayne

Got my old school pumpin', hip wheel on recline
If you think a nigga broke, you out'cha monkey-ass mind (ayy)
Diamonds on my pinky (ayy), hand on the pine
Bitch touch and now your momma do the second line
Screens fallin' from the sky, syrup fallin' in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin' down, nigga, what?
Got diamonds in my mouth, got some Gucci on my seat
Got Gs on my ass, bitch, it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can gon' pass the mic, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck
Still screamin' out mayne (mayne), pistol in my hand
Southside so throwed (throwed in the game)
Big face on my chain, 84s on the frame
Big bodies comin' down, hoggin' up both lanes

In them foreign thangs with the guts exposed
Stunting ain't a thing to me, and it's obvious, it's plain to see
That you gon' make us both
Get into some thangs that is for grown folks
And they might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared, you need to get like me
Stunting is a habit, just gotta have it
Shorty keep throwing that thang at me, I'm gonna bag it
When she see the karats, a real Jessica Rabbit
Can't another boy do the things you like
He ain't your type to change your life, but if you did ya homework
Girl, I'm pretty sure you know what I got, drop-tops
And you know Jones and Banner gonna roll, let me stop
Stunting is a habit

Let them bougie boys ride Maybach
I'm in the candy, laid back like I slang crack
My money stacked to the ceilin'
Gettin' in my Chevy's like climbin' up a buildin', them 28's on deck
37 on my wrist, a hundred five on my neck
This rap money's okay but you should see these movie checks
And this cartoon cash, the SS so sweet
My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm but then she slit both wrists
There go them suicide doors (doors), wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes and got duals on the ass
And some chrome on the nose, the white boys go, ""Sweet""
But black folks go, ""Oh,"" I got a 'llac full of ammo
I'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the Lambo' (uh)
The butterflies goin' up
I got Chad in my heart and DJ Screw in my cup

Have you ever seen a Chevy with the, get like me

Not on some gangsta shit, man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing
I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you, pimpin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
'Cause I hit you, and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say

I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side

Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone

Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride

What's whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate?
If you want it, come and get it, you know I stay super straight
Ran up in my spots and now I'm working out the Super 8
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate
Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah, I got that super cake
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait

Hat back, top back, ain't nothin' but a young thug
HKs, AK's, I need to join a gun club
Big wheels, big straps, you know I like it super-sized
Passenger's a redbone, her weave look like some curly fries
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce
Pocket full of celery, imagine what she tellin' me
Blowin' on asparagus, the realest shit I ever smoked
Ridin' to that Trap or Die, the realest shit I ever wrote
They know I got that broccoli, so I keep that Glock on me
Don't get caught without one, coming from where I'm from
Call me Jeezy Hamilton, flying down Campbellton
So fresh, so clean, on my way to Charlene

I feel like it's still niggas that owe me checks
I feel like it's still bitches that owe me sex
I feel like this but niggas don't know he's stressed
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best
I got the money and the fame, man, that don't mean shit
I got the Jesus on a chain, man, that don't mean shit
'Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace
Yo, I need just at least, ugh, one of Russell's nieces
On, I let my nightmares go
I put on everybody that I knew from the 'Go
I know hoes that was fronting when they knew he was broke
They say, ""Damn, Yeezy, Yeezy, you don't know us no more
You got that big fame, homie, and you just changed on me""
You can ask big homie, man, the top so lonely
I ain't lying
So lonely, I ain't lying
Let me see what we have tonight (What we have tonight)
I'm high as a satellite (Satellite)
I see those flashing lights (Flashing lights)

Fuckin' dogs, barkin' and shit
(Don't shoot, don't shoot!)
Fuck you, nigga!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 1: The Game]
Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away, like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain, suicide
I'm from a windy city like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
‘Cause that's Jesus, people – and Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Siegel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin', ""Why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?""
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 2: The Game]
We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin'? I earned 'em
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like M.J.B. no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""

Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 3: The Game]
Walk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts
Listenin' to the Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, in my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life

Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper

My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a play, anybody seen the scale?
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay? Let's go

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Today was a good day, hope I have me a great night
I don't know what you fishin' for, but catch you a great white
Me, I see great white, heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this, who knew it came in bales?
Who knew what came with jail? Who knew what came with prison?
Just 'cause you got opinions, does that make you a politician?
Bush robbed all of us, would that make him a criminal?
And then he cheated in Florida, would that make him a Seminole?
I say, and I quote, ""We need a miracle""
And I say a miracle 'cause this shit is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces, I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and CC Allah
Mr. Soul Survivor, guess that make me a Konvict
Be all you can be, now don't that sound like some dumb shit
When you die over crude oil as black as my nigga Bu
It's really a Desert Storm, that's word to my nigga Clue
Catch me in Las Vegas, A.R., Arizona
Rep for them real niggas, I'm winnin' in California
Winnin' in Tennessee, hands down Atlanta

I said I woke up this mornin', headache this big
Pay all these damn bills, feed all these damn kids
Buy all these school shoes, buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to Polos
Love me some spinach dip, I'm addicted to Houston's
And if them numbers is right I'll take a trip out to Houston
An earthquake out in China, a hurricane in New Orleans
Street Dreams Tour, I showed my ass in New Orleans
Did it for Soulja Slim, brought out B.G. 
It's all love, Bun, I'm forgivin' you, Pimp C
You know how the Pimp be, that nigga gon' speak his mind
If he could speak down from Heaven, he'd tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doin' fine, Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change, so y'all let the man shine
Stuntin' on Martin Luther, feelin' just like a king
Guess this is what he meant when he said that he had a dream

She ain't a politician, honey's a pole-itician
My president is Black, Rose golden charms
Twenty-two inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse your ego, we've got mouths to feed, so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
'Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity, never lose your integrity
For years there's been some prize horses in this stable
Just two albums in, I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr. Black President, yo, Obama for real
They gotta put your face on the 5,000 dollar bill

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a play, anybody seen the scale?
My president is Black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay? Let's go

[Outro: Young Jeezy]
See, I'm sittin' here right now, man
It's June 3rd, haha, 2:08 a.m. 
Nigga, I wanna say win, lose or draw
Man, we congratulate you already, homie
See, I motivate the thugs, right?
You motivate us, homie, that's what it is
This a hands-off policy
Y'all touch him, we ridin', nigga
Yeah, first Black president, win, lose or draw, nigga
Haha, matter of fact, you know what it is, man?
Shouts out to Jackie Robinson, Booker T. Washington, homie
Oh, you ain't think I knew that shit?
Sydney Poitier, what they do?
Our president is Black
I'm important too though
I was the first nigga to ride through my hood in a Lamborghini
Yeah, haha, you know what I'm sayin'?
Nah, for real, though, we ready for change

In that slow lane, what is your whole name?
I forgot this ho's name, I'll call her Louise Lane
Up on that boulevard, 24's rotate
Ice Cube comin' through, gotta make the hoes wait
Roll at my own pace � nigga, don't hate!
Fuck all you fat-fuckers leanin' up against my paint!
Ice Cube, I steal a little paint (Movie star!)
Fuck you! Pour a nigga a lil' drink!

You should call The Navy, ever since the 80's
I've been doin' good, they been doin' bad
When I see you walk by, I'm pursuin' that
But never chase it, my game is so basic
As soon as I lace it � baby, wanna taste it?
Just face it, put me to the test
Ice Cube would ace it, I'm built for success
Fuck a Rockstar! We wanna party like a Rap Star
In the club, in the house, or the backyard (Yay-yay!)
You make it rain with ones, I make it rain with hun's
And we get lap-dance from nuns
They put away they crucifix

Money cash flow, all big face hunneds
Stuntin' on the pole, got them D-boys runnin'
Shorty got both broke, can't see what's comin'
Wear them apple bottoms, wear them apple bottoms honey
Dolce and Gabbana, and she get it from her mommy
Louis bag kit, Gucci, Fendi and Armani
See them karats on her wrist, now she pimp Bugs Bunny
Used to date Kanye, now she want me
Flo Rida got the juice, wanna take my OJ
It ain't her birthday but her name on the cake
If I ever pay for nookie grade A

Cut, take one, Hollyhood act on
Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone
Tattoo tight work, bought the ""Low"" ringtone
Plenty ghetto booty, plenty ghetto booty on her
Roll up with kitties, don't smoke Arizona
One night stand, one night with the clan
One night, one time broke her off ten grand
Project all the way, gutter all day
Pure uncut, stain wall with a J
Shorty don't fake, she'll put it in your face
Three stories by them hoodrat's beg

Sight seein', we might be in

Next semester, she transfer to Florida State
Cookin' like Home EC for financial aid

Remember? Mean time our finance is straight
I even up the doors to the financial estates (Ross)
She use to fight with her mom
'Til I sat 'em both down, now she tight with her moms
Yeah, I put the ice on her arm

Put the house on the water, hit the beach whenever
She from the north and still can't believe the weather

He was talkin' loud at first but you can see that he didn't
You can see I ain't sweatin'
Hell I'll call him up myself and tell him how he can get it
Naw, please don't confuse me miss
I'm tryna see how I can put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this

She replied, ""I, like to do the wild thing""
Actions took place, at my place
Now my place is her place

393,Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It,Raw Footage,Ice Cube,2008-01-01,281653,60,"

[Intro]
- Prior to gangsta rap music, the world was a peaceful place. And then all of that changed: violence, rape, murder, arson, theft, war. These are all things that came about as a result of gangsta rap music
- But wasn't Compton dangerous before gangsta rap ?
- Wrong! Compton was a nature preserve for bunny rabbits. When gangsta rap came along, they tore down the country clubs and put up housing projects!

(Maestro!!!) Blame me!
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R-A-W, R-A-W

[Verse 1]
You lookin' at the grand wizard
Warlord, vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up, pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothin' like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothin' like a man that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga, I'm hot as Phoenix, Arizona
I'm Utah: I got multiple bitches
It's a new law, keep a hold of your riches
Dumb nigga, don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant

[Hook 1]
I can say what I want to say
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 2]
I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle, just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga
Y'all spit saliva, and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this, ho, if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta, and why should I change that?
Fuck you old mothafuckas tryin' to change rap
But ain't you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back?
I'm tryin' to get me a Maybach
How you mothafuckas gonna tell me ""don't say that""?
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971

[Hook 2]
So if I act like a pimp
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy-headed ho
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

[Verse 3]
Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin' about real life
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain, not your back
Use your brain, not a gat; it's a party, not a jack
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal
And don't be material
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot Van Ness and imperial
Look at my life, Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
‘Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I ain't gotta be fake, ‘cause he is my homie

[Hook 3]
If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

[Bridge]
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow-flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R-A-W, R-A-W

[Outro]
Oh yeah, and another thing
For all y'all niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talkin' about gangsta rap
‘Cause 9 times out of 10
You don't know the fuck you talkin' about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
Stay the fuck out of mine

Girl we got us somethin special, I know it ain't nothin better
You can trust me cause I'm tellin ya I don't want nothin else
You get lonely you can just use the pictures up on the dresser
I ain't never think a woman could have me this lil'feelin
Girls'll walk up on me flirtin, I be tellin e'm ""Nah I'm chillin""
Hug you till I go to sleep just to squeeze you like my lil'pillow
Then I wake up Monday mornin'don't come back till Friday
In my whole 'nother whip, sittin on 6's with tinted windows
Baby phat bags, all the purses with matchin'slippers
You done heard I fucked this dumb bitch-now you mad trippin
Tears in ya eyes, yellin you tired of my fast livin

From rags to riches, if that shit was to hit me again
I'd have to bring you with me again

And you stuck by a nigga like my left hand
It wasn't all this at first, till we just kept prayin
Now I'm on-and you a bad ass bitch, Yes maam
And oh yes maam as soon as I get home it's gon'be work time
And you know us we like to fuck like it's the first time
You tell the first time for some reason
I knew that I was stayin'and I figured you wasn't leavin
I know that I don't need ya, but be feelin like I need ya
When it come to certain people, I act like I got a meetin'
But I just wanna please ya-trust me they just wanna be ya
Whenever I ain't wit ya baby I can't wait to see ya
I gotta keep it G and say I love ya, cause I'm fuh real
I wash away all the tears, we been doin this shit for years

And you will see it in my eyes
You're the completion to my life
Ain't even a question, you already know
But I remind you that, I miss you

[Intro: Ace Hood]
Cheah, Ace Hood
See mama, all I want you to do is hold it down for me
I want you to be my ride or die
While I go get this money, I promise I'ma get us out the hood baby

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
'Cause I ride, or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride, or die, we gon' make it out this hood

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Baby look, just ride with me, swear that I got us mama
One thing I love about it, see you ain't with that drama
You be my ride or die like Bonnie I'ma play the Clyde
Promise to move you out the hood into a bigger house
That's why you never trip, I'm grindin' bump a 9-5
Gotta get this money, paper callin' but you never whine
Gotta ask the cash come with bags, you should see your eyes
That's why I suprise about you stacks to ease your worried mind
'Cause when I'm gone, lil mama home alone at every time
You never blowed my phone up yet 'cause you respect the grind
And you never holla 'bout a problem, keep it all in line
My gutta baby, never maybe always gonna ride

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
'Cause I ride, or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride, or die, we gon' make it out this hood

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
And umm we can do them long vacations, thinkin' Jamaica lately
Can't take them deep relations, baby, just keep it patient
Shawty know what I do, shawty know who I be
You know I'm in these streets, the only way that we gon' eat
I keep it gutta, never cut her when we in them sheets
I get some cutta, grap the duffle then I'm in the streets
Come back with bundles, pimp a half a G and Louis V
But you ain't trippin', never question 'bout a nigga G
We keep it real, ain't no other that could fill ya sneaks
I ride for you, you ride for me, that's where we need to be
I hold you down, you hold me down and I fulfill your dreams
You're my Beyonce, I'm Hova, won't you ride with me?

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
'Cause I ride, or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride, or die, we gon' make it out this hood

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Now what's the definition of a rider?
Through it all, they gon' stand right beside ya
If you got one look 'em in the eyes
Tell 'em you gon' ride
Tell 'em you gon' ride, ride
'Til the wheel fall off or the day that I die
That's on my life, ain't nothing wrong with tryna love somebody
Tryna tell you shawty that

[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Ace, and I promise this to you, I'ma get us out this hood
Into them places that you thinkin' that you never could
But you gotta ride like them tires on the Mini Coop'
I'ma get this cash, paper bags and give half to you
Forget them haters, keep you tailored, see what's sexy too
And I like your body, all I think about is doin' you
And I love the money, so I guess it's like doin' two
You ride or die same smile when you see the loot

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
When I chase this paper, you ain't gotta wait for me to bring it back home to you
'Cause I ride, or die, girl we gon' be good
And if you ride, or die, we gon' make it out this hood

[Outro: Trey Songz]

We gon' make it out this hood, no

Go head, spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care 'bout what you felt
Fuck you nigga, I know I'm dope
Felt like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top, ain't nowhere to go now
Instead of me, she gon' go down
Maybe I would have slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
This could fuckin get old, well it's good I'm young
Before my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yo, yo Drew and Inf
This-this, this right here is crazy
Yo I, I feel big, you know what I mean?
Like, not, not big in the sense of, weight
You know what I mean? Like gainin' weight or nothin' like that
Like colossal
Like, you know what I mean, like (sighs)
I heard you were lookin' for me

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Haha, you know, hehe)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (I know, haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hey, hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Shit, you know)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say ""Church!"" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world and I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: ""Wayne quit!?""
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

[Chorus: Sha-ron Prescott & JAY-Z]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin')
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', chyeah)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott, Lil Wayne & Choir]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Hova!)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Weezy)
They've been wondering why (Baby!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hahaha)
Tell me, where have you been? (I been hustlin')
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Hustlin' hard)
They've been wondering why (Chyeah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve

I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'mma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York
""Juicy"" had us feelin like we was from New York
And that's real shit, blazed the Philly
It's ""Summertime"", shout out to Will Smith
Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince?
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks
My nigga Nas told me ""Money Make the World go Round""
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for ""Love LA""
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back

[Verse 2: The Game]
Public Enemy and N.W.A
Is all my boombox had to say
""Today was a Good Day"" had the hood buzzin
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothing
Everybody first bootleg was ""Boyz N the Hood""
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood?
When the cars ride by with the ""Boomin' System""
Two door Mustang, and the roof was missin'
Every girl at your school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright (alright)
Cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with O.P.P.? Then bring Naughty in
They say ""It Never Rain in Southern California"", Tony! Toni! lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
See ever since the day I've got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm makin it known cause, I just want the world to know

I'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for me, ye-yeah

[Verse 3: The Game]
Cash Rules Everything Around Me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
In the back, I relax with all the hunnies
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say ""WHOA!""
Everything full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talkin 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
See ever since the day I've got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day

See, Mary J. I want you to understand
You paved the way, for me

Let that ass drop, like my '64
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Then she drop it low, to gets the dough
I said I like the way she do it, she put her back into it
Let that ass drop, like my '64

[Verse 2: Tony Yayo]
I need a dollar for every time that my heart beat
Now how much it that
I can breath on a track and make money, ahha ahha
Now how much is that
I'm getting money baby, my truck a Lamborghini
I'm in ali-dibi, where the girls are freaky
Haters wanna be me, hoes glad to see me
Ma I love it when you lie and say my eyes are dreamy
Certain niggas fall in love with a bitch
Patron in my dick, I fuck the blood out a chick
I'm in the club frontin, I'm in the club stuntin'
10 Grand to buy the bar, Ma it ain't nothing

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
If home girl wit it, I'm get it, hit it, split it
She'll think about me everyday, hour, minute
Second to nobody, baby check it
You look as good as your check
And when your naked, I'm ready to fuck
A little head in the truck
If her tongue game good, I'ma let her come up
When the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town
Stash box down, put the magnum down
I'm with G-Unit, see you next
Nigga you not ballin a the G2 jet
How ever do you want it, how ever you do need me
OPE on a fuckin' CD, it's ME

[Bridge: 50 Cent]

[Verse 4: Young Buck]
She got a nigga on the count down
Waitin on it like... three, two, one - yeah right now
You got skills on them high heels
When we leave this club, I'm take you were I live
Do me before I get her
I might eat out tonight, depending on how I feel
Baby girl got a thang for me
She do what every I say and I ain't got to make it rain money
Go getta and she ghetto with it
Told shawty don't do it, but she already did it
I'm all on her back, when she move like that
You can find me where every she at, Like that

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

Let's get it

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Aye, knock knock, bang bang, where the cash at?
If you ain't got it, leave you bloody like a Tampax
Come up swinging at you thugs Aflac
Then I fall in the suede black Maybach
See, I'm back for the money like I left that
See I be running on the route where the cash go (where the cash go)
And any nigga interfering with the cash flow
See, you can get pumped on like a Citgo
Make his body bounce bounce like a 64
Tall clips, chrome lips, see the big gold
I'm a duffle bag boy like I move coke
Big crack through the music so the flow dope
I keep my money over bitches til the door close
I need money like a bitch need dick mo'
I'm trying to see it like a motherfucking cash flow
Rubber bands in my pants, understand, bankroll

[Hook: T-Pain]
I'll tell you one thing, don't play about mine

I need all my dough not a dollar short
And if you don't have it then you got to go

Cash flow, I need it on time
I'm talking bank roll - my money, my money, my money
Cash flow, I need it on time
I'm talking bank roll - my money, my money, my money

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
And where my money? Young nigga's gotta have that
Rubber bands by the grands in a big bag
Pockets fat like I'm carrying a backpack
A couple grand for the Louis band knapsack
Understand I'm the man who you can't match
Money man minivan full of brown bags
Bet a grand, any man never top that
Touch money and the gat pop those straps
Get in the Coupe and the top drop right back
I ain't playing, creep your avenue and I'll blast
Bust shots like a New Year's Day blast
And I ride all day like a bus pass
Grinding hard for the bread and the cash flow
Kick doors, wave 4's, where the cash go (where the cash go)
I'm trying to see it like a motherfucking cash flow
Rubber bands in my pants, understand, bankroll

[Hook: T-Pain & Rick Ross]
I'll tell you one thing, don't play about mine

Cash flow, I need it on time (Ace, I see you nigga, Trilla)
I'm talking bank roll - my money, my money, my money
You M.O.B, now, nigga, you untouchable

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Big money in the dope hole
See the beamers when you pull up in the dope home (my money)
Seventeen and he got his own kilo
Running green, nigga living like Nino
Ridin’ clean wax hit me for the c note
It ain't green, get it back with tha C loc
Momma dead broke, daddy fucked up
I'ma make them come and hit me with the RICO
God damn it, I'm still in the dope spot
Why the fuck you think I pull up in a dope car?
Gold shoes, stepping out with a dope bitch
Cartel, so she gotta suck four dicks
ID me, V.I.P
DJ Khaled, M.O.B
Girls so hot, Ace so cold
Taking bets, Ace won't fold

[Hook: T-Pain]
I'll tell you one thing, don't play about mine

[Chorus]
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 1]
They call me Uncle L, Future of the Funk
Records I recorded minus all the junk
People spread gossip and believe what they must
While I slam dunk dicks and make em bite the dust
A minute is needed to make a phony roni bleed
And put him in a bucket like it's chicken feed
Check out the - pick of the litter, not a quitter, I'm nice y'all
And I'ma dust you off and dust you off twice
You neer heard this so observant all hysterical fan-
-natics of the Asiatic miracle man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm Real
If you're another brother's fan? Forget how you feel
Cause he's so-so, I got the instinct
They call me Deputy Dog, now put your ass in the clink
Innovating, devastating, and dope on the single, now
Let me see your earrings jingle

[Chorus]
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 2]
I chopped you, chewed you, baked you and {fucked} you
That {shit} you pop, you need to stop, you're kind of rude you
No good {niggaboo} tryin' to base
How we livin' homes? Get out my face!
I'm complete, in effect, and I can't fall
I rise, suprise, and I advise you all
To stand back and peep, don't sleep or doubt
My skill'll get ill, I turn the mother out
I'm top-notch, you're still playin' hop-scotch
Now I'ma do ya while the party people watch
You're real funny, you really try to go for yours
But I know why: you ain't had no dough before
So you tried and lied to drain my fame
This ain't a game, yo, you know my name
Forget all the MC's who like to mingle
Yo baby, let me see your earrings jingle

[Chorus]
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 3]
When you first walked in, I ain't know what to think
You grabbed the microphone like your shit don't stink
And tried to run down that; I can't get over that
Shit you were sayin' - you call that a battle rap?
How you gonna go against an army with a handgun?
I'm Cool J, yo you don't understand, son
I'm a legend, on top of that I'm livin'
Now you look stupid like that bitch Ms. Givens
Whoever geesed you up; nah, how should I say it?
Whoever set you up, they knew just how to play it
Cause man, YO, I feel for you brother
I'm a baaaaaad... (Word to the mother!)
Takin out suckers while the ladies pucker
And rollin' over niggas like a redneck trucker
Innovatin', devastatin', and dope on a single, now
Lemme see your earrings jingle

[Chorus]
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 4]
Yeah baby, you know what I mean?
You like be jinglin crazy, word
(yeah yeah yeah)
All over this funky beat
You be like jinglin', and your earrings be jinglin'
And shakin all over the place and all (mm-hmm)
It's like real, it's real wild to me honey yaknahwhatImean?
The way you be jinglin', worrrrrrd

[Chorus]
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 5]
Can't believe you tried to grip the same mic as me
Your grip's too weak, you can't hold it, B
You can dream of makin' progress and gettin' this nice
But when I roll up, it's like Hip Hop Vice
I serve to curbs, I never swerve I'm superb
Every word you heard played tricks on your nerves
You played your hand, lost track of your plan
When I show up, I blow up, end of story, my man
I'm a play you like a poker chip, that's what you get
I bet your fret, sweat, and regret you met
The titan of fightin', excitin' when writin', you triflin' toy-boy
I gotta enlighten, so start bitin'
You know you can't create and get mean like this
When I'm on the court, G, it's strictly SWISSSSHHHH!
When it's all over, said and done, my friend
They say, ""That {bad motherfucker} just scored again""
So take a step back, give me some room to wreck shop
Here's your token back, you're gettin' off at the next stop
I'ma deliver and give a speech with vigor
I drink some Olde E and start waxin {niggas}

[Chorus]
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Mr. West is in the buildin'
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Ayo I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the Pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermès, Pastelle, I pass the dressin'
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
""Why you so mad for? Why you gotta have it?""
‘Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
Tryin' to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
(No one on the corner…) Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans, ‘cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans, ‘cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggas know you're thorough when the girls say yes
(Yes…) But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school, but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks, I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooovaaaa
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hooooovaaaa
Did you even have any doubt? After Doubt it was over

No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Church, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require what I desire
I got stripes, Adidas
Mami scream ""¡Papí, no más!""
Run up in your shit, just me, no más
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?
I know it's us, ‘cause we the only thing to talk about

[Chorus: M.I.A., Lil Wayne, T.I.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (And I'm gone)

Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Ha! Ya think)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (That's right!)

[Verse 4: T.I.]
You can go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity, and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't livin' what you kickin', then you worthless
Lookin' from the surface
It may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lot of records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit, hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

[Chorus: M.I.A., T.I.]
No one
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Okay)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah, That's right)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Okay)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah, so you notice, huh?)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Ha! Yeah!)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Okay, tell'em for me shawty)
No one on the corner has swagger like us (Yeah, that's right)
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us (Yeah!)

[Outro: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Together we made it
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
See, a nigga survived the worst, but my life is glorious
Better know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus
As force securin' the win, better believe I'm so notorious
You know that I've been 'bout my bread
Even though we rappin' now (Yes)
And yes, we used to live on the strip
Even though a nigga higher level trappin' now (Uh!)
Superseded every one of my little struggles and (Huh!)
Failure has never ever been an option (trust)
A nigga paper long like rush hour traffic
And I'm about to take the hood shoppin'; get it!

[Hook: Chester Bennington & Busta Rhymes]
Oh, together we made it (You see we did it, niggas!)
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
(C'mon!) Forever we waited (ha ha!)
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road (To the riches)
On the road (To the ghetto)
On the road (In the projects to this bangin' instrumental)
On the road (ride with me!)
On the road (we come to get it)
On the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
When it all got started we were steadily just gettin' rejected
It seemed like nothin' we could do would ever get us respected
At best we were stressed
At the worst they probably said we're pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle, just the way to connect it
I was fightin' through every rhyme, tightenin' up every line
Never restin' the question if I was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it or let it die
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride
Sing it, yeah!

[Hook: Chester Bennington & Busta Rhymes]
Oh, together we made it (You see we did it, niggas!)
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
(C'mon!) Forever we waited (ha ha!)
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road (To the riches)
On the road (To the ghetto)
On the road (In the projects to this bangin' instrumental)
On the road (ride with me!)
On the road (we come to get it)
On the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Look, in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm buildin'
Shit that I can leave for my children's children's children's children
Now on my wake-up I smile to see how far I've come
Fightin' for sales on a strip to I gained the hustle from
From nights in jail on a bench usin' my muscles, son
To countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russell was
But now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you get it
Sing it!

[Hook: Chester Bennington & Busta Rhymes]
Oh, together we made it (You see we did it, niggas!)
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall
(C'mon!) Forever we waited (ha ha!)
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But we took it on the road (To the riches)
On the road (To the ghetto)
On the road (In the projects to this bangin' instrumental)

On the road (yeah, yeah, yeah!)

So roll that coke white carpet to the hood
It's the Dope Boys reunion, the dress code's strictly:
""White tee, Air Force 1s and some Dickies""
I'm from the city where the skinny niggas die
Only birds and Nextels chirp in the sky
And we ride for the letters on our fitted cap
Niggas hit the stash, get a strap and go get it back!
That's for the gangstas, the hustlas, the ballas
From Downtown L.A. to Uptown Harlem
And D-Boy money ain't raining, it's storming
So stop the music when the champagne pouring
And hold them glasses high (yeah)
And when a nigga ask you why, you tell them

Every dollar that I count can't grow in my account
My account can't count up all my money in an hour
Cause it's comin' too fast and I'm scared it won't last
Look that white girl in her face, told her this was her last dance
God damn, speed got my heart racin'
See I don't have the nominations you can blame it on my occupation
Ceasar salad, Caesar's Palace
You not a boss little nigga cause your cheese is average
In the Benz, AK ridin' shotgun
It's a Benz cause you're broke 'til you got one
It ain't nothin' do 100 in the Maybach
Throwin' money out the roof motherfuckin' brake pads

Sittin' in the living room watching the Grammys
Wishin' that was me that was on the Grammys
All I needed was someone to get behind me, money rain on me

Homie help me out cause this boy is a drug dealer
Now I'm flyin' high cause my gift grew wings
And now I'm flyin' down like the cool crew winds

Red carpet and it's smellin' like green

Got a question for the streets (huh, huh)
Who hotter than me (ha, ha)

[Verse 1]
How you feel haters, your hatin didn't work
Thanks to ya'll I'm the hottest thang on earth
Got the bitches and the goons I'm the first
Worth a couple mill, but still in the dirt
Catch me flushin thru the city shorty no shirt
I don't fall gonna come on the first
Blew life in the streets, had em rebirth
See me on fire hater, I know it gotta hurt
I'm so hood, classic verse
Wanna talk business, what's in the purse
Might gone die, won't get murked
Who hotter than me, nobody sir

[Verse 2]
Betcha can't name a ho, who don't want it
Like you can't name a city I ain't hot in

Tell you what to call me, promoter best friend
Put cha money on me dog, if you want win
Lotta rappers sittin home on the weekend
Gotta waitin list shorty put cha off in
Can't move me dawg for under 30 grand

Who runnin the streets where all the folks in
Streets done spoke, shawty I'm the man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Somebody put me out, I'm on fire
Please tell the feds, I'm retired
Know a lot of rappers for hire
Streets don't fuck with you, you a liar
Plies real, you're preachin to the choir
Yo buzz in the streets expired
Count a hundred grand I'm kinda tired
Keep yo ho from around me before I buy her
Goons love me I'm they supplier
Street cred don't get no higher
Got the 40 homie cause it's lighter
Sincerely yours mr. plier

Mmmm, ay-oh

Na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-nah

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out ""Fuck that""
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

[Chorus: Andrew VanWyngarden & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about the night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

[Chorus: Andrew VanWyngarden & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

We are, yeah, I said it: we are

Black cards, black cars, all black everything

I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back

This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct

412,Beautiful,Relapse: Refill,Eminem,2009-05-15,392826,68,"

[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Outro]
Yeah, to my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world: God gave you shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are, and even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

[Verse 2]
Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

[Verse 3]
Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feeling blue
The sun is shining, man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

[Chorus]
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night

416,All the Above (feat. T-Pain),If Tomorrow Comes...,Maino,2009-06-26,319940,60,"

[Hook: T-Pain]
Tell me what do you see, when you're looking at me
On a mission to be, what I'm destined to be
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothing but love
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above
All the above (x7)

[Verse One: Maino]
Listen! Really what do you see, when you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams
I've done been through the bottom, I've done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I got nothing but love, now that I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money make all of us change
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me, and I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me, but these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets, till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally done made it
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse Two: Maino]
It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you living my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seeing me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't, I envision Obama
I envision in diamonds, I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm making a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness


[Hook: T-Pain]

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Now if I'm out on the spot
Or if I'm out on the block
I hustle hard cause it's all the same (They know, they know)
If you know that grind don't stop
Because I rose to the top
And everybody knows my name (Maino, Maino)
Hey! I'm still grinding, still hustling
No more pain, no more suffering
My ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Keep on dancing and shining for love

(What's up Fabo?)
Aye man, I got that black AmEx with me
A.K.A. that ""Throw It In The Bag"" card
(Radio Killa), yeah

[Break - The-Dream]
Now I know you ain't over there staring at my girl
Yeah, I know you ain't over there staring at my girl
Nigga, I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl
Now I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl
I keep her in Louboutin, Louis Vuitton
Gucci down to her feet, yup, just like me
I'm the one, with them ones
Fuck the price on the tag, just throw it in the bag

[Hook - The-Dream]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Just throw it in the bag

[Fabolous talking over the Hook]
Ladies, y'all ready to go shopping?
Neiman Marcus on me and all that?
Yeah, come on then

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Look at price tags, where they do that at?
Heard that in A-T-L, when I'm in A-T-L
Just ask my baby gal, I treat that lady well
Ain't nothing so-so, and I know J.D. well
A couple Benzes, black, white, gray C.L
Got niggas looking like, ""Did we miss a Mercedes sale?""
Don't wonder what I do, just know they pay me well
They keep that Gucci and that Louis on my labi-el's
That's the way we feel -- must be nice, man
You with the right man, you ain't gotta price scan
Or ask how much, now what I look like?
Son I'm from Brooklyn -- what it look like?
You get it cause I got it, I got it so you get it
In Miami they say, ""Don't stop, get it, get it""
Mami do the Speedy, daddy do the duffle
Bag full of chips, we ain't talking Ruffles

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
See, I know what I'mma tell her
The same thing that the bank robber told the teller --
Just throw it in the bag
That's the way it supposed to be
A real nigga 'posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic, it's safer to ask it
So dead that nigga, I will pay for the casket
That Remy Mar' got him spitting plenty bars
Broke ass nigga, couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso, he ain't got to know so
Such a gentleman, dozen bottles of that Rose Mo'
Oh you got a man? Well, you need a richer one
Meet me in the parking lot, the plates say ""GET U 1""
Meet me at the register, I'm there on the regular
Them niggas price checking, you can help them in a second
As we proceed to give you what you need
Like we breaking down the weed
Shorty, throw it in the bag

Take the knife off the AK and cut these niggas (Kane is in the building, nigga)
Yeah, and fuck these bitches
I swear I care about everything but these bitches
I don’t care, I ""so what"" these bitches
And I put Young Mula, baby, way above these bitches
Ha! If it ain’t broke, don’t break it
And-And-And if he ain’t shook, I’m gon' shake him
Hope I don’t look weak, 'cause when a wolf cry wolf
You still see that wolf teeth, mothafucka
Ha! Fu-Fu-Futuristic handgun
If you act foul, you get two shots and one, haha
I'm at your face like Lancôme, haha
You niggas softer than Roseanne's son, hey
You cannot reach me on my Samsung
I'm busy fuckin' the world and givin' the universe my damn tongue
Ha, crazy motherfucker, I am one, ha
But the crazy thing is, I began one
Hehe! All-white bricks
I’m straight like it’s jumping back to 36, nigga!
Big house, long hallways
Got 10 bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And we don’t want no problems
Okay, you’re a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga's brains on the street, oooh
Now, pop that pussy
I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh-huh, and we be steady mobbin'
Whoa, Kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]

So Icy; so, no Nike, boy
Just Gucci, Louis, Prada, 'scuse me ('Scuse me)
""Gucci Mane keep shittin' on me, why that boy keep buying jewelry?"" (Kane is in the building, nigga)
East Atlanta cockin' hammers, bandannas on car antennas (Ugh)
No, we do not talk to strangers
Just cut off these niggas' fingers (Huh)
Gucci’s armed and dangerous, cocaine, codeine and angel dust
This AK-47 will hit ya everywhere from the ankle up (Ankle)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, the-the-the money is the motive
Fuck with the money, it get ugly as Coyote

I buy a pound, break it down, and put it in a stogie
Swagger so bright, I don’t even need light
I’m with a model broad, she don’t even eat rice, ha
But, would you believe it? She eat dykes
And she asked me for a picture, so I gave her three strikes, yeah

This rap game, I got my hand around this motherfucker
Yeah, I said ""game,"" but I ain’t playing around this motherfucker!
Yeah! I’m the best to ever do it, bitch, haha
And you’re the best at never doing shit
If you the shit, then I'm sewerage
Tr-try me and I’ll have your people reading eulogies, haha
I swear, you can’t fuck with me
But I can fuck your girl, and make her nut for me, then slut for me
Then kill for me, then steal for me, and of course, it’ll be your cash
Then I'll murder that bitch and send her body back to your ass

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And-And we don’t want no problems
Oka-Okay, you’re a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat

Uh-huh, and we be steady mobbin'
Whoa, Kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Ugh! M-Man, suck my clip
Swallow my bullets, and don’t you spit, ughh!
I am the hip-hop socialist
Life is a gamble and I’m all about my poker chips
Do you want a dose of this? I will make the most of this
""F"" is for ferocious, murder your associates
The top is so appropriate, this is just where I belong
Keep a hard dick for your girlfriend to wobble on, Weez'!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And-And we don’t want no problems
Oka-Okay, you’re a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat

426,Crack A Bottle,Relapse: Refill,Eminem,2009-05-15,297520,67,"

[Intro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
Okay, let's go!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Break 1: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Break 2: Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move,"" a bitch move

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Uh-huh
Um, uh-huh
Okay

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit and urine
On these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse 2: Drake]
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
It goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenants
And if I said ""I'm goin' in"" then I motherfuckin' meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'ma motherfuckin' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' wit it
She said ""I seen it all"", I say ""No you fuckin' didn't""
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said ""I can't feel my legs"", I'm like ""Bitch, me neither""
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And I'ma be a legend even when my life end
And I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
Yeah I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

Used to rock a throwback, ballin' on the corner
Now I rock a tailored suit, lookin' like a owner
No I'm not a Jonas, Brother, I'm a grown up
No I'm not a virgin, I use my cojones

So I switched gold bottles on to that Spade shit
You gon' have another drink or you just gon' baby-sit
On to the next one, somebody call the waitress
Baby, I'm a boss, I don't know what they do
I don't get dropped, I drop the label
World can't hold me, too much ambition
Always knew it'd be like this when I was in the kitchen
Niggas in the same spot, me I'm dodgin' raindrops
Meanin' I'm on vacay, chillin' on a big yacht

Uhh, Big Pimpin' in the house now
Bought the land, tore the muh'fuckin house down
Bought the car, tore the muh'fuckin roof off
Ride clean, I don't never take the shoes off
Bought the jeep, tore the muh'fuckin doors off
Foot out that bitch, ride the shit like a skateboard
Navigation on, tryin' to find my next thrill
Feelin' myself, I don't even need a X pill
Can't chill but my neck will
Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal
Uhh, I don't know why they worry 'bout my pockets
Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin' in the projects
Had her out in Bed-Stuy, chillin' on the steps
Drinkin' quarter waters, I gotta be the best
M.J. at Summer Jam, Obama on the text
Y'all should be afraid of what I'm gon' do next
Hold up

429,Soundtrack 2 My Life,Man On The Moon: The End Of Day (Int'l Version),Kid Cudi,2009-01-01,235626,58,"

[Verse 1]
I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
""Why he by himself?""
He got two older brothers; one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Verse 2]
I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Verse 3]
I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down; pussy, and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Outro]
To my life, to my life, to my life...
Uh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Talkin about a beautiful figure, astonishing as Greek mythology
Body be just like the girl in uhh, what's that movie?
Never mind, let me enter yo' atmosphere
As you enter my world and let me touch that booty
I can't believe that yo' momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul, you need a modelin role
Still a playa know you got it when you climbin
From the bottom to the top of the pole, cause you can pop in control
Yo' phatty's so accurate when I'm smackin it
It's makin me say ""What I gotta do to get with that?""
When it come to makin it rain I can get it wet
When it come to cuttin that monkey I can get it wet
You want some media baby you need a better man
He cover politics, I'mma be yo' weatherman
Cause every time I'm lookin up and I see more ass
I'mma constantly see rain in the forecast
This-a-way, that-a-way, I'm flickin 5000 Ones

It's a celebration, you the champion, here's the fetti confetti
C'mon and get drunk with the money hauler

[Twista]
But when I'm not for the feminine (feminine)
And everybody that proceed with the hatred I'mma teach 'em a lesson
I take shots of adrenaline (adrenaline)
Cause that's the way I receive immunization against the recession
I got the muscle off of my hustle-and-flow money
A entrepreneur with ways to get mo' money
So don't be trippin whenever you see me throw money
Huh, it's just a lil' bit of show money
But if you want me to get it wet in other ways
Then I'mma have to beat it up but first I'mma play wit'chu girl
Touch your ears and your neck and play wit'cha pearls
Then I reach up in your pants and play wit'cha pearl
When I lay you down you ain't gotta be frontin and fakin on me baby
Cause I know it take the right touch
I ain't stoppin 'til you wet up the covers
Because I gotta keep on fuckin 'til I see a lot of white stuff
Now you got me excited, I can't hold it
I'm feelin it comin, I'm 'bout to let off an explosion (ohh)
Let it ride when I see you animated and shakin
Now when I touch your body you catchin convulsions (uh-huh)
That's when I know I'm doin what I'm supposed to
You chose me, I chose you
Don't think I can get it wet? I told you
Come and let the Twist rain down on you

431,Say Something (Featuring Drake),Shock Value II,Timbaland,2009-01-01,240920,56,"

[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you we a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?

[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 2: Drake]
I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

Walking around fucked up twisting her fingers
Homegirl slipped up, drunk, got wasted (Wasted)
Now she backstage and she trying to get famous
See me, I'm a drinkie, drinking, Gucci Mane shake it (shake it)
Club life, damn right, Gucci Mane wasted (wasted)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rockstar lifestyle, might don't make it (Wasted)
Living life high, every day, clique wasted (Wasted)
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stanky (Wasted)
Wake in the morning, ten o'clock drinking (Wasted)
""Party, party, party!"" Let's all get wasted (Wasted)
Shake it for me, baby girl, do it butt-naked (Wasted)
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted (Wasted)
Tell the bartender, ""send me twenty more cases!""

[Verse 2: Plies]
I don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm looking for a bitch to suck this Almond Joy
Say she got to stop sucking cause her jaws sore
Got a bitch on the couch, bitch on the floor (on the floor)
Your partner just popped another one, now he rolling more
Was on 3 pills, now he on 4
I don't know why, but that Remy turn me into a whore
Walked in the club, pocket full of big faces
Got that .40 on my waist and it's off safety
About 40 goons with me and we all wasted
On Remy straight tonight, dogg, no chaser

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rockstar lifestyle, might don't make it (Wasted)
Living life high, every day, clique wasted (Wasted)
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stanky (Wasted)
Wake in the morning, ten o'clock drinking (Wasted)
""Party, party, party!"" Let's all get wasted (Wasted)
Shake it for me, baby girl, do it butt-naked (Wasted)
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted (Wasted)
Tell the bartender, ""send me twenty more cases!""

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Whole clique faded, we geeked up crazy (crazy)
Big boy bracelets, we ""white-boy wasted"" (Wasted)
No shirts, fuck it! Our necks and arms are tatted
We sloppy drunk, disgusted, the liquor keep wasting (wasting)
285 Eastside, me and Plies wasted (Wasted)
Racing, Chevy beating, booty/butt chasing
Spring bling, 50 thousand, white girls shaking
Some dancing naked, but everyone's wasted (Wasted)
Magic City Monday, ball-player wasted (Wasted)
This is for your uncle drinking Thunderbird, wasted (Wasted)
12-pack wasted, I need more cases (Wasted)
And Gucci's not a racist all my diamonds caucasian

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rockstar lifestyle, might don't make it (Wasted)
Living life high, every day, clique wasted (Wasted)
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stanky (Wasted)
Wake in the morning, ten o'clock drinking (Wasted)
""Party, party, party!"" Let's all get wasted (Wasted)
Shake it for me, baby girl, do it butt-naked (Wasted)
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted (Wasted)
Tell the bartender, ""send me twenty more cases!""

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
This is GPSA (Ghetto Public Service Announcement)

434,Beautiful Bliss,Attention Deficit,Wale,2009-01-01,304613,38,"

[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like, sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away, away
It's a beautiful bliss, oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss, oh (When you spill out hits)
Beautiful bliss, oh, oh, oh (When you fly as a bitch)
And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 1: Wale]
Fresh out the airport, fresh out the chair with the clippers
Like Shaun Living', thinking, hmm
I'm tryna get it like Sean get it
If Lord giveth, a mil' and a MILF light skinneded
It's slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That Anvil Neidhart minus bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my heart's in it
When Bret Hart meet Brett Farve
A sharpshooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less six or more
I invest in my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My project is like what pros inject
And a nigga so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath
No joke, you see them boys sign me to the scope, right?

[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like, sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away, away
It's a beautiful bliss, oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss, oh (When you spill out hits)
Beautiful bliss, oh, oh, oh (When you fly as a bitch)
And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I phone home to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil nigga from the Ville could get a deal?
Ay, tell them niggas at the top we want yo spot we are for real
And yeah, we heard you got it locked but like them socks, we on your heels
So you best be on your toes nigga, especially on your flows nigga
Cause man they keep on checking for me, especially all your hoes nigga
Catch me on your doorstep, you see me, let me in
All I wanna do is eat, I'm like a freaky lesbian
Now all I wanna do is ball on TV, need ESPN
They heard I'm 'bout to blow so all my enemies say let's be friends
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
Where all the girls we knew that screamed fuck you going let me then
I'm definitely in a class of my own, at dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton, he just passed the Patron
Ain't nothing given dawg, it's earned if you just living, dog, you learn
I let you niggas see the light, I'm like the prison yard, I yearn
For that living large, but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your sunrise, kick back and know your son set
Forever I ain't run yet, and I never will, Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said fuck the world and I ain't come yet, you up yet
My punchlines like gut checks I'm raw-dog, I'm rough sex
I'm on deck, I'm up next, I'm God blessed, I'm success
So fuck stress, you can get the fuck from 'round me
And if you listening, know you wondering where the fuck they found me
I'm from the Ville, boy, ay Wale, good looking

[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like, sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away, away
It's a beautiful bliss, oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss, oh (When you spill out hits)
Beautiful bliss, oh, oh, oh (When you fly as a bitch)
And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 3: Wale]
Another day up in my ES, wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet, fuck it
I don’t be stressed like relaxed, muscles
Your feedback ain't plusing, and you can keep it running
Ha, like a muffler, when we not in summer
They like A-list actors, they not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function, I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female vagina punctu-
Waiting, showing you her beauty if she's naked
It's like the view of a painting or a lakehead
This just how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital from Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or an I placement cause
Shifted keys gets your capital raised up
Motherfucker, hah!

[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]
Babe, you know it gets no better than this
It's like, sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away, away
It's a beautiful bliss, oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss, oh (When you spill out hits)
Beautiful bliss, oh, oh, oh (When you fly as a bitch)
And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

Chillin' with two women, me and mister thanksgiving
I'll be some where fly, Thanksgiving goin' swimming
While you was wearing snorkels, I was out snorkeling
Of course I'm shit on these niggas like porcelain
It's more than love with this money I'm infatuated
Captivated by the diamonds and capsulated
Shooting range in the basement, Olympic size pool
With pool table adjacent, I love me some money
I stash money fast money
Comin' on bumpin' them onions
Bunking and crossing the country
So, so don't cross me you monkey
Sleeping on 50s and 20
Rollin' up onions and hundreds, pulling in porches
And phantoms, fancies be throwing their panties
Drama and cannon demand it
Gucci and Drama they panic
Ugh, they sick they vomit
Put some more commas in front of it
Drama got Gucci he stuntin'
Gucci and Drama we done it
We got so much money, 'bout our money
Some money mo' money, dummy

Uh, money gotta big house, money got a bad girl
Money make you famous, money rule the whole world
Money set trends, money is in the Benz
Money got associates acting like friends
Money, money he owe money money he blow
Money got sexy ladies dancing on da pole
Money got dem on a stroll, money platinum and gold
Money make 'em shake it like Beyonce Knowles
Only God knows the things I do for money
That's a young fly man
Check out them dimensions, 20s, 50s and 100s
Don't you make me look good when you see us out stuntin'?
Catch a whif, find out that's yo' bitch
Catch her pushin' your wheel, then the go and pushing clips
She got me going crazy I'm coo coo for boucoup bucks
Plus I can't lie, boo, it's only you I love

Your sex drive it match my sex drive

Get intoxicated, drunk off my love, call it Hennessy thug
Passion, you laughin', I make you smile on the regular
Tell me what you want, shawty, and that's what I'mma get to ya
Yo, I need you to be what I need more than liquor and weed
I need you to maybe give me a seed
I need you to give me a reason to breathe
I need you, I'm telling you so now you know what I need

Tha Biz—Tha Bizness

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, I like a long-haired, thick redbone
Open up her legs, then filet-mignon that pussy
I'ma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in, I'ma own that pussy
Gon' throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl, I got that dope dick, now, come here, let me dope you
You gon' be a dope fiend, your friends should call you ""Dopey""
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth 'cause they don't know me
Ha, but you can call me Tunechi
I'll fuck the whole group, baby, I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise, I should be Hooked on Fonics
Hah, but anyway, I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it
And watch you back it up and dump it, ba—back it up and dump it

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Drake]
'Cause we like her (Hey), and we like her, too
And we like her (Hey), and we like her, too
And we like her (Hey), and we like her, too
And we like her, and she like us too, and oh...
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world (Oh...)
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world (Yeah, alright)
Oh, oh, ahh

[Verse 2: Drake]
She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they wanna talk about is partying and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashing 'em all
Young Money, man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please, bring your finest
And what are all your names again? We drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am? Les-be-honest!
She wants me, she wants me
'Cause I got it all, shawty, tell me what you don't see
I will fuck with all y'all, all of y'all are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosing hoes
And Wayne say, ""Pussy, pussy, pussy""
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all, damn
And every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider
And then...

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Jae Millz]
'Cause we like her (Hey), and we like her, too
We like her (Hey), and we like her, too
We like her (Hey), and we like her, too
And we like her, and she like us, too, and oh...
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I—I—I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Calling all sexy ladies
Oh, oh, ahh

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
But, um, I ain't being disrespectful, baby, I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels, so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every high-saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper, and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Wilt, so, married women or MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss—you can get ""Tha Bizness""
Ha!

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
These hoes is God's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass
Ugh, and I swear I'm feelin' all of y'all
I'm scrollin' down my call log, and I'ma call all of y'all
My butter-pecan, Puerto Rican
She screamin' out, ""Papi!"" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can Rodham too, boy, I gets my pimpin' on

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
'Cause we like her (Hey), and we like her, too
We like her (Hey), and we like her, too
We like her (Hey), and we like her, too
And we like her, and she like us, too, and oh...
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world (Oh, oh, ahh)

In about three years, holla at me, Miley Cyrus

I exchange V-cards with the retards
And get behind the Christian like Dior 'cause he are

Every block, every hood
Every ghetto got beef
Got a heater on my lap
And another in the back
Shit, how I’m supposed to cope
With all this stress on me?
Er'body and their mama callin' feds on me
I don't know what I'ma do, but I'ma do it
Look I don't know what I'ma do, but I'ma do it
I got money on my head but I'm ridin' in a drop (Drop)
Drop (Drop)
Drop (Drop)
Drop (Drop)

[Intro]
Yeah it's young Khalifa man
Mr. Spacely
Everyone call me man
Taylor Gang or die
And this project is brought to you by
Champagne and paper planes too
Rostrum Records in this bitch
Taylor Gang, Heavy Hustle, Deal or No Deal
Yeah, bitch

[Verse 1]
I'm screaming fuck them niggas who hated
I'm money affiliated
Speculating me landing
Must have got me mistaken with lame niggas
Know you gon' get high as fuck
As long as the planes with you
Left that major situation alone
And became richer
People talking down
But see me I'm the same nigga
Leave your bitch around
We gon' drink the champagne with her
We don't touch the ground
See a cloud with my name it
Only e-z widers please
No cigars for me and my gang
Fool, I'm a legend in these streets
Cause how I do my thang
And don't wear the fitted
I got the city on my chain
Oh man, still they hate and talk smack
Knowing if I was gone
There'd be no throne to throw your rocks at
Cruise at maximum altitudes
I'm tryna top that
So in touch with the real
Them suckas tryna stop that
But I, live or let die, party get high
And tell them lames to deplane or let fly

[Hook]
Don't know what they hate for
I'm just gettin' my paper
Well, maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
I try to believe you
I don't wanna leave but I need to

[Verse 2]
Stuck alone in this wave race
Say I'm living too fast
Don't plan on changing my pace
Got one foot on the gas
There's never a need for brakes
Smoke e-z widers with hash
Fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing my cars
A waiter to bring me plates
Shrimp and filet mignon
We celebrate buying drinks
With a couple of broads
My niggas and who got love for me
It's lonely at the top
I'm tired of having company
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in
I'mma stand out
And view my life through this lens
To see how it pans out
Substitute teacher ass niggas need a handout
Middle finger, screaming fuck them niggas who hated
I'm money affiliated
Pop another bottle, that chronic smoke integrated
Speculating me landing, must've got me mistaken
I'm speaking as the captain of the plane
You's a runner on the jet way
Fool

[Hook]
Don't know what they hate for
I'm just gettin my paper
Well, maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
I try to believe you
I don't wanna leave but I need to

It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya

[Intro]
One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

[Verse 2]
And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'ma sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

[Chorus]
I don't give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow
But I do it to her

[Bridge]
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah
I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know
I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like, like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone

[Verse 1]
Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can’t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere

[Chorus]
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

[Verse 2]
Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere

[Chorus]
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

I'm in the collard green 6, cornbread in the guts
Got the Halloween kicks, trick-or-treating the clutch
C'mon nigga, is you tricking or what?
Flow, flow tighter than a dick in the butt
Just hopped off the plane, came back from Vancouv'
Little white tee, some boobs, and bamboo
White girls tell me ""Hey Nicki, your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?""
As-Salaam Alaykum, no oink for me
And I never let a d-boy boink for free
'Cause it's Barbie bitch, you can join the wave
I've done penny nickel dimed, I done coined the phrase, ha!
You couldn't beat me there if you had a Lear
Indian-style, courtside with a cavalier
V.I.P. rosé; you can have a beer
'Cause honey when you getting money you don't have a care

Four chick foursomes, skin color's mocha
Sally and Sonia, put the pussies on my totem
Pole vault stroke 'em uhh, strike ya like bowling
Now open like you yawning, it's 6 in the morning
Sleeping on me, probably in a coffin
I'm hotter than the end of fucking August, I'm awesome
I'm awesome: repeat it to ya grandma, and uncles
Or mothers, Tyga's no dad but I'm the motherfucker
Motherfuckers, this the last supper
Look, no hands, I'ma bread cuffer
I don't dare love her, I'ma daredevil
I don't fear nothing motherfucker, Young Money!

Fuck around and never get Roger back

I'm goin' in!
Fresh off the jet, sharper than Gillette
The blunt still wet, so pass it like Brett
We sip side of mug, we call it upset
Smoke more than four quarters, we call it sudden death
I'm a beast. You a pet
AK long neck. Keith Sweat, haha!
Weezy motherfucker, Capo in this bitch with me
Money talks and have a convo in this bitch with me
I'm mountain high Colorado in this bitch with me
Flow crazy 7:30, you just 6:50
Twenty bullets from the chopper take the roof off
Laughing to the bank, I'm a goofball
Hahaha! It's YM
And we at your neck, like a violin
It's our world, we make it spin
And y'all the prey- amen!

Fuc-fuck around and never get Roger back!!

[Intro]
“Cause I ain't going out like a sucka, no way”
I'm nice right now man
I-I feel good
If you have a drink
Would you please put it in the air?

[Chorus]
That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

[Verse 1]
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up (Let's get fucked up!)
I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise, you naked
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is, um

[Chorus]
That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (I wish we taped it)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again

[Bridge]
Man I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
Man I love college (Hey!)

[Verse 2]
I can't tell you what I learned from school
But, I could tell you a story or two
Um, yeah, of course, I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'till the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is

[Chorus]
That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (I wish we taped it)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again

[Bridge]
Man I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
I love college (Hey!)

[Interlude]
Now if everybody would please
Put their drink, as high as they can
As high as they can, and repeat after me
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Freshmen! Freshmen!
Freshmen! Freshmen!
Do something crazy! Do something crazy!
Do something crazy! Do something crazy!
Keg-stand! Keg-stand!
Keg-stand! Keg-stand!

Man I love college, I love it
(That party last night)
Goodnight everybody
I gotta head back to class for a little bit

[Chorus]
That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (You know what's going on)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed (You are all invited)
But my good friends is all I need (Bring your friends)
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

Do I really have to graduate or can I just stay here for the rest of my life?

[Outro]
But after that
You know what's goin' down
My house and 3 kegs
See you there, you're all invited
Bring your friends, bring your mom
Do I really have to graduate
Or can I just stay here the rest of my life?

[Intro: Mr. Hudson]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Just let it run..
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of Young

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

Can't worry about the past cause that yesterday

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Gotta stay on my grind cause it's my time

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Guess what time it is? My, my, my time
You can check your iPhone, better say it's iTime
I don't even need a watch, I don't even see a clock
Soon as a I walk in, it feel like me o'clock
Yeah, me o'clock, every time I check
Niggas don't measure up and try to blame the Pyrex
I'm a do it bigger than a 5X
Can't ride with a L, so I don't drive Lex
Game's so bickery, so full of trickery
Nursery-rhyming: hickory, dickory
Blowing that sour, the hood call it ""pickery""
Biggie, Puffy, Busta, victory

My time's more like fly time
Don't call it ""getting dressed"", call it in the ""sky time""
If you ain't a pilot, you probably couldn't style it
Unless you was a stewardess, you won't know what to do with this
First I took the time out, then I put the time in
Money ain't everything, it's more about the timing
So I got the Audemars, flawless diamonds
In other words that's called perfect timing
I feel like a favor, I feel like a savior
They clocking my neck: I feel like I'm Flavor
I go so hard, Loso God, damn

You know I got committed with it since I've been up in the zone
Sign the dotted line, now it's on
So y'all better check your wrist-piece
Cause it's time to make history
Just hop in here up on this hit streak
How the, how the, how the hell you gonna evict me?
You know I'm here to stay, never clocking out
Big bottles we popping now, no telling where we stopping now
And I represent the Chic-a-g-o
On the track with F-A-B-O

[Hook]

[Mike Jones]
Now put yo right hand in the air
Put the left one in yo underwear
Now tickle dat cat, tickle dat cat
Now tickle dat cat, tickle dat cat
Ooooh, she act a fool on the dick, fool on the dick
She act a fool on the dick, fool on the dick
Now get sick with it and do the split with it
Now get sick with it and do the split with it
Say girl drop & gimme 50, drop & gimme 50
Drop & gimme 50, drop & gimme 50
Now I don't mean to start no riot
All the ugly women in the house be quiet

[Hook]

[Hurricane Chris]
Now by the 3rd verse It's way hotter, we wide open
She dropped it down low with her hips and her thighs rollin'
I noticed that can't nobody do it like I do it
I'm posted in V.I.P. with 2 chicks on the side of me
We got money so tell the other niggas to stop pullin' out they cash
And let me see how you act for a stack
Drop it low and brang it up like you a fool
Now put a dip in yo back and let me see what you can do
She say if she bend it over it'll be a full moon
I told her bend it over let me see that full moon
Like the boom boom room whole club on tune
Shake it like you tryna break it ain't no sense in even fakin'
You know me I do it big by the bar and tell em jig
As soon as we walk in the do', we go straight to the dance floor
Get it poppin'

[Hook] - 2X

[Outro]
This what you get when Collipark hook up with The Package Sto' nigga
Ya'll ain't know we was coming back like this, did ya?

450,My Mom,Relapse: Refill,Eminem,2009-05-15,319866,64,"

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay!
Alright, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight, a'ight (Yo, yo)
Yo, yo
Alright, I'ma lay the chorus first
Here we go now!

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Verse 1]
My mom, my mom, I know you're probably tired
Of hearin' 'bout my mom, oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an undera-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
""What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?""
""Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer""
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleepin'
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra!

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner!
""You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait
'Til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make
That retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fuckin' place, finnickin' 'til next Thanksgiving
And if you still ain't finished it, I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip, it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father, he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business, kid!""

[Bridge 1]
My mom
There's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on, 'cause—

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Bridge 2]
My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin' it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh!

[Verse 3]
Man, I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
A tragedy, the fuckin' past ended up catchin' me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
""Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it""
But I don't need it — ""Well fuck it then, break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up""
Alright Ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop it, gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip, then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead

[Chorus]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom!

[Outro]
My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my momma
Me momma, I like-a da momma
Haha, sorry Mom
I still love you though!
Dr. Dre, 2010
Hey, this shit is hella hard, homie
Yo, take us on outta here
Woo!

[Verse]
Yeah, I got a feelin' nigga, really that my money be the root
Look up at the stars, she like, ""Honey, where the roof?""
Pull up, hear the dogs, Canaries, they gon' woof
Even once had a job pourin' tar up on a roof
That boy had it hard, no facade, it's the truth
So now when I menage and get massaged it's the proof
Proof's in the pudding and that baking soda cakin'
Paper that I'm makin' got her takin' photos naked
Listenin' to niggas like whistlin' at Wendy Williams
I flip my middle finger, I'm chillin' on twenty million
The rumors turn me on, I'm masturbatin' at the top
These hoes so excited, so they catchin' every drop
I'm dodgin' debacles like potholes in Jamaica
We cut down the weed, bury the paper on the 'maicas
Martin had a dream, Bob got high
I still do both but somehow I got by
Creflo prayed, Mike Vick paid
Bobby Brown straight, Whitney lost weight
Kimbo Slice on the pad when I write
That Mayweather money lookin' funny in the light
But who really cares? We just throw it in the air
Celebratin' wealth, pourin' Moet in her hair
Excuse me, her weave, the bluest of weed
Trunk full of white, car smell like blue cheese
That boy get salad, beef bowel movements
BMWs on them big thangs lookin' foolish
Shawty sitting low, big thangs popping
Tip on the Glock from a Crip up in Compton
Shootin' at the cops, fuck one-time
I gave her to the block, I fucked one time
We Boyz N the Hood, and nigga, you lil' Tre
Suppress ya appetite, we takin' ya lil' tray
Love my handgun, but my choppa still the shit
Banned in 1994, but I'm ""2 Legit 2 Quit""
1996, kilos was the shit
But that was better than roofin', that shit be bad fo' ya skin
Niggas was ruthless, Lord knows that I sin
But I thought about my future and the loops I could pin
Walked out on the gig and I turned to the streets
Kept my name low-key, I ain't heard from in weeks
I came up wit a strategy to come up mathematically
I did it for the city but now everybody mad at me
Motherfuck 'em all, they sweat from my balls
If I drop another album, I did that for my dawgs
Ten Maybachs everybody ridin' big
I just sit back like, ""Look what I did""
Then I bow my head and beg for forgiveness
Once I said my prayer, everybody back to business
Smokin' on a blunt in my own restaurant
People lookin' from a distance think I'm Big Daddy Conch
Reincarnated, spirit of a G
Beef I'll make you thinner, take a seat so we can eat
A Farrakhan aura, pause on the pork
You eat from the bowl, while your dog need a fork
Niggas ain't loyal, snakes slithered in they coil
I'm laughin' at you cuz, kill you niggas when I'm bored (yeah!)
We steppin' on you crew 'til them motherfuckers crush
And makin' sweet love to every women that ya lust
I love to pay ya bills, can't wait to pay ya rent
Curtis Jackson baby mama, I ain't askin' for a cent
Burn the house down nigga, you gotta buy another
Don't forget the gas can, jealous stupid motherfucker
To another chapter, paper that I captured
Caught up in the rapture off gunshots and laughter
Homicide is humor and nigga you lookin' funny
Women love to stare cause they know they see the money
I open up her mind by openin' bank accounts
Deposit a hundred stacks, break-up, won't take it out
Baby that's a gift, maybe you could live
I knew it wouldn't work but, I just like to give
Used to run the street, young nigga bare feet
Now I'm in the suites and I'm eatin' crab meats
Ice so right, other rappers envy
They callin' all my jewelers up, askin what he spendin' (whaaat?)
Thinkin' 'bout Boss, not thinkin' 'bout them
This a letter to my enemies, one I won't send
Amen

Brr, brr, brr

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm the fire, you say you more fire then nigga, you a liar
Homie you and I, know the truth but that's 'tween you and I
Stupid jewelry on me then, stupid jewelry on me now
If you think you finna shit on Gucci then just show me how
Someone dissed me yesterday, what I'm s'posed to do, go cry?
With my money chasin' million dollar mission on the side
Church's chicken in my Lambo, bought two drumsticks and a thigh (Nyooom)
I'm so hood right now they question whats gettin' Gucci high
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Girls fightin', hoes fistfight just to touch my tie
Get my squad squad, I ain't been this hard in a while
Blow cha-cha, I ain't been this hard in a while

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Every single night I'm ballin'
Sippin' on that drank, rims crawlin'
Mostly every night I'm count, count
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shoot, shoot
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shoot, shoot (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
Wilder than a jaguar, wildin' in a Jaguar
Pl-Please don't play with me, I'll put that pistol on your grandpa
I swear I'm so wild I think I just may need a xan bar
And if she on my team I bet that bitch know who she playin' for
Mr. Coach Carter or Mr. Go-Harder
And I like my kush dry like a fish with no water
Swagger stupid perfect, I might as well surf it
And if she ain't fuckin' she get the voicemail service
Tell it like it be, bitch I do it for the bloods
And every fuckin' time I say soo woo it's for the Bloods
What you dislike I love, man I do just like I does
And if you wanna fight then come on you can fight my guns
Weezy man, Young Money

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style

Mostly every night I'm count, count
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shoot, shoot
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shoot, shoot

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Let's do the furs, his and hers
Started gettin' on my nerves so I hit her with a ""BURR!""
Hustlers love me, all the haters hate me
They brothers wanna fight me, they sisters wanna date me
I tell her bust it baby, you could be my bust it baby
But stay in your place, I need my space: don't suffocate me (please)
Back black approach us, clack clack take gats out the holsters
Cops in black the patrol us, treat us like rats and roaches
But the blue Benz, Got the blue lamps
And your wifey, well we use her for her food stamps
Ain't no big deal, but she keep the fridge filled
Eggs scrambled, cheese grilled, cold juice the grits kill!
Don't forget veal, Italiano, Gallardo
Yea the big wheels, like milk your wig spilled
We'll rush in ya spot, knock knock, snub of the Glock
It Gucci turn, Huh?, You gon' suck it or not

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Stupid wild, super stupid wild, homie that's my style
Every single night I'm ballin'
Sippin' on that drank, rims crawlin'
Mostly every night I'm count, count
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shoot, shoot
Niggas wanna fight but I'm shoot, shoot

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
Bitches wanna fuck me mainly
Cause I got the kitchen all famous
I'm tryna hold my head above water
Stack a billion cash I just oughta
My shades cost that cause I'm Gucci
My warddrobe Gucci'd out like I'm boostin'
I shine just all the time your homie shine
Wanna hate me get a ticket and join the line, fine
