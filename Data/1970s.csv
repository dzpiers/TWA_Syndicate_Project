[Verse 1]
Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gather 'round the parlour talking
That's when Billy would take me walking
Through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows, to my surprise

[Chorus]
The only one who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
The only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Yes he was (Hallelujah)
Yeah, he was (Hallelujah)
Ohh, he was (Ohh Hallelujah)

[Verse 2]
Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talking to me
He keeps 'n tellin' me ""Everything is all right"" (Sock it to me)
Baby baby ""Everything is all right""
(Ohh Sock it to me)
Can I sneak away again tonight now

[Chorus]
The only one who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
I tell you that the only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Yes he was (Hallelujah)
Yeah, he was (Hallelujah)
Ohh, he was (Haaaa)

[Verse 3]
Hmmmm
How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealing kisses from me on the sly
Taking time to make time
Telling me that he's all mine
Learning from each other's knowing
Looking to see how much we're growing

[Chorus]
The only boy who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
I tell you that the only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Ohh, yes he was (Hallelujah)

Long as I remember, the rain been coming down
Clouds of mystery pouring, confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages, trying to find the sun

[Chorus]
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

I went down Virginia, seeking shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals, wrapped in golden chains

[Chorus]
And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

Heard the singers playing, how we cheered for more
The crowd had rushed together, trying to keep warm
Still the rain kept pouring, falling on my ears

And I wonder, still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

[Verse 1]
I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola
C-O-L-A, Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, ""Lola""
L-O-L-A, Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight, she nearly broke my spine
Oh, my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh, my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

[Post-Chorus]
Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, ""Little boy, won't you come home with me?""

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes, well, I almost fell for my Lola

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Well, I looked at her, and she at me

[Verse 2]
Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

[Chorus]
Well, I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never, ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said, ""Little boy, gonna make you a man""
Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola

She ain't got no money
Her clothes are kinda funny

Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes

There's something about her hand holding mine
It's a feeling that's fine
And I just gotta say, hey!
She's really got a magical spell
And it's working so well
That I can't get away

I'm a lucky fella
And I just got to tell her
That I love her endlessly
Because love grows where my Rosemary goes

And nobody knows like me

Rolled off of their ship, and here's what they had to say
""We're callin' everyone to ride along to another shore
We can laugh our lives away and be free once more""

But no one heard them callin', no one came at all
Cause they were too busy watchin' those old raindrops fall
As a storm was blowin' out on the peaceful sea
Seventy-three men sailed off to history

Now that you're gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me

You took me from the shelter of my mother
I had never known or loved any other
We kissed after taking vows
But that night on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms

I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me

Ohh

Don't you know that I wait
In the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold
Is a band of gold
And the dream of what love could be
If you were still here with me

Since you've been gone
All that's left is a band of gold

[Verse 1]
Just got home from Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch
Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singing
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door

[Verse 2]
There's a giant doing cartwheels
A statue wearing high heels
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
A dinosaur Victrola, listening to Buck Owens
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door

[Bridge 1]
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon?
Doot, doo doo
A wondrous apparition, provided by magician
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge 2]
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon?
Doot, doo doo
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door

[Verse 3]
Forward troubles Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows
Doot, doot, doo, looking out my back door

17,Ain't No Mountain High Enough,Diamond Diana: The Legacy Collection,Diana Ross,2017-11-17,215200,56,"

[Verse 1:]
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry
You see, my love is alive
It's like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please, my darling, let it be me

[Verse 2:]
I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words

[Bridge:]
No wind, (no wind) no rain, (no rain)
Nor winter's cold
Can stop me, babe (oh, babe) baby (baby)
If you're my goal

No wind, no rain
Can stop
If you want to go

[Verse 3:]
I know, I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
You'll always have me

And if you should miss my love
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close, or the lips
That used to touch yours so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free

[Refrain 1:]
Ain't no mountain high enough, aah
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you

Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from you

[Refrain 2:]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you

[Refrain 3:]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough (one more time)
Ain't no river wide enough (say it again)
To keep me from you

[Outro]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Nothing can keep me
To keep me from you
Nothing in this world

[Verse 1]
Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place
To spend the night
Heavy rain fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
It's all right

[Chorus]
A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
It seems like it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a-flashin'
Taxicabs and buses
Passin' through the night
A distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain
To the night

A rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, or think of it
It's life, and you just got to play the game

I find me a place in a boxcar
So I take my guitar
To pass some time
Late at night, when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I feel fine (I)

[Chorus]
But it's a rainy night in Georgia
Baby, it's a rainy night in Georgia
I feel it's rainin' all over the world
Kind of lonely now
And it's rainin' all over the world
Oh, have you ever been lonely, people?
And you feel that it was rainin' all over this man's world

[Outro]
You're talking 'bout
A-rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin'
Rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin'
A-rainin', a-rainin', rainin' over the world
I said now, rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin'

Can't you see in my face girl, oh girl don't you
Knock down the old brick wall, and be a part of it all

[Intro]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there tryin’ to fool the public
But when it comes down to foolin’ you
Now, honey, that's quite a different subject
But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Really I'm sad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)
Oh, sadder than sad
(I'm hurt so bad)
You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad
(I pretend to be glad)
Like a clown, I pretend to be glad
(Sad, sad, sad, sad)

[Chorus]
Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Mmm-hmm, oh yeah, baby

[Verse 2]
Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
In order to shield my pride, I’ve tried
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Decided to go
(Why did you go?)
Oh, I need you so
(I need you so)
I'm hurt and I want you to know
(Want you to know)
But for others I put on a show
(It's just a show) Ooh-oh

[Chorus]
There's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Just like Pagliacci did (The great pretender)
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye (The great pretender)
But in my lonely room, I cry

[Chorus]
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby

[Outro]
Now if there's a smile on my face (Tears of clown)
Don't let my glad expression (Tears of a clown)
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear (Tears of a clown)
Make you think that I don't care
When really I'm sad
Hurtin’ so bad (Tears of a clown)
Cryin’ all the time...

27,Patches,Patches,Clarence Carter,1970,193826,46,"

I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me ""Patches""
Papa used to tease me about it
'Course deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the time got bad

The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said
He said:

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""

Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was daddy's strictest rule

So every morning fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home

But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said:

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through

'Cause every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me

Every night I heard my mama pray:
""Lord, give him strength to make another day""

Though years have passed and all the kids have grown
The angels took mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin':

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""

Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin':

""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""

I could still hear papa when he's saying:

""Patches, I'm depending on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worryin' me

31,Question,A Question Of Balance,The Moody Blues,1970-08-07,344226,49,"

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war

'Cause when we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution
That is burning in its greed

(ahhhh ahh ah)
(ahhhh ahh ah)
Ahhhh ahh ah

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
Because the truth is hard to swallow
That's what the wall of love is for

It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way that you mean it
When you tell me what will be

And when you stop and think about it
You won't believe it's true
That all the love you've been giving
Has all been meant for you

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me through

Between the silence of the mountains
And the crashing of the sea
There lies a land I once lived in
And she's waiting there for me

But in the grey of the morning
My mind becomes confused
Between the dead and the sleeping
And the road that I must choose

I'm looking for someone to change my life
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew
Could safely lead me to
The land that I once knew
To learn as we grow old
The secrets of our souls

It's not the way that you say it
When you do those things to me
It's more the way you really mean it
When you tell me what will be

Why do we never get an answer
When we're knocking at the door?
With a thousand million questions
About hate and death and war

When we stop and look around us
There is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution
That is burning in it's greed

When no one else can understand me
When everything I do is wrong
You give me hope and consolation
You give me strength to carry on
And you're always there to lend a hand
In everything I do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you

And when you smile the world is brighter
You touch my hand and I'm a king
Your kiss to me is worth a fortune
Your love for me is everything
I'll guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you

I'll guess I'll never know the reason why
You love me as you do
That's the wonder
The wonder of you

She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter 'cause it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and then she goes

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...

Don't ask her why she needs to be so free
She 's gonna tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
And when you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...

There's no time to lose, I heard her say
You got to catch your dreams before they runaway
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams
And you, might will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday
Who is gonna hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm gonna miss you...

Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday

Oh, darling
I'm so lonely without you
Can't sleep at night
Always thinking about you

But if I had the
Chance to start all over
I would be wishing today
On a four leaf clover

And leaving would be
The last thing on my mind
If I could turn back
The hands of time

(If I could turn back
The hands of time) oh, baby
(If I could turn back
The hands of time)

Oh, darling
I can't hold out much longer
For the pain is getting deep
Oh, the hurt keeps getting stronger

But if I had just one more try
I would be yours alone
Until the day I die

And we would
Have a love so divine
If I could turn back
The hands of time

(If I could turn back
The hands of time) oh, baby
(If I could turn back
The hands of time)

Remember, girl
That I love you

Oh, darling, please
Please let me come back home
Your love has been
So good to me, baby
And I just realized
Without it, I can't go on

Cause you're the other half
That makes my life complete
If I had one more chance
We'd have a love so sweet

And leaving would be
The last thing on my mind
If I could turn back

The unborn grass lies waiting for its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring

Anything that it would tell me, that's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's the thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay

To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow

And take the snow back with you

52,Spill The Wine,The Best of Eric Burdon & War,Eric Burdon,1970,246200,36,"

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie
But there I was
I was taken to a place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high by the mountain tops
Naked to the world
In front of
Every kind of girl
There was long ones, tall ones, short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said...

Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl


I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said

Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl

It's on girl, all you gotta do is spill that wine
Spill that wine, let me feel, let me feel hot, yeah! yeah!
Spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine
Spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine
Take that pearl!

So long, boy, you can take my place

Put my gun down, the war is won
Fill my glass high, the time has come

Cannon fire lingers in my mind

I can still see the water pool
And I remember the girl that I knew from Yellow River

Why, because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run, but you just can't hide

An eye for an eye
Tooth for a tooth
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on

Well, the only person talking about loving thy brother is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learning but the teacher
Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration, aggravation, humiliation
Obligation to our nation

Ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey

The sales of pills are at an all time high
Young folks walk with their heads in the sky
The cities aflame in the summertime
And oh the beat goes on

Evolution, revolution, gun control, sound of soul-shooting rockets to the moon
Kids growing up too soon
Politicians say, ""More taxes will solve everything,""
And the band played on

So, round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed nobody knows

Oh, Great Googamooga
Can't you hear me talking to you
Just a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey

Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
The Beatles new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live
Is on an Indian reservation
The band played on

Eve of destruction, tax deduction
City inspectors, bill collectors, mod clothes in demand
Population out of hand, suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world are shouting, ""End the war!""
And the band played on

Great Googamooga
Can't you hear me talking to you
Just a Ball Of Confusion

Yeah, here comes Amos

[Verse 1]
Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by his self in the swamp
He hunted alligator for livin'
He just knock 'em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gonna get you Amos!
It ain't legal huntin' alligator down in the swamp boy!

[Verse 2]
Now everybody blamed his old man
For makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His Daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist and throw him in the swamp
Alligator bait in the Louisiana Bayou

[Chorus]
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well they raised up a son
Who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
Called him Amos Moses

[Verse 3]
Now the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left cuz alligator bit it!
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow!

[Verse 4]
Well the Sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp tracking alligator skin
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy
But he never come out again
Well I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to?
Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana Bayou!

[Chorus]
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well, they raised up a son
Who could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth,
Called him Amos Moses

Set out on 'em Amos
Make it count, Son!

Wake up, Maggie
I think I got something to say to you
It's late September and
I really should be back at school

[Chorus 1]
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

[Verse 2]
The morning sun, when it's in your face
Really shows your age
That don't worry me none
In my eyes, you're everything

[Chorus 2]
I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

[Verse 3]
All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and mother what a lover!
You wore me out

[Chorus 3]
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool

[Chorus 4]
Or find myself a rock & roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh, Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway

Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these days, ooh, ooh, ooh

Virgil Caine is my name and I drove on the Danville train
Till so much cavalry came and tore up the tracks again

It was a time I remember, oh, so well

Back with my wife in Tennessee
And one day she said to me
Virgil, quick come see
There goes the Robert E. Lee
Now I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Just take what you need and leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

I knew a man Bojangles and he'd dance for you
In worn out shoes
With silver hair, and ragged shirt, and baggy pants
The old soft shoe
He jumped so high, jumped so high
Then he’d lightly touch down

I met him in a cell in New Orleans I was
Down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As the smoke ran out
He talked of life, talked of life, laughed
Clicked his heels and stepped

He said his name ""Bojangles"" and he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants and feathered stance
Oh he jumped so high and then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke through tears of 15 years how his dog and him
Traveled about
The dog up and died, he up and died
After 20 years he still grieves

He said ""I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drinks a bit""
He shook his head, and as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him please

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance...

Well, I've got to run to keep from hidin'
And I'm bound to keep on ridin'
And I've got one more silver dollar
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no

You packed your bags, as I recall
And you walked slowly down the hall
You said you had to get away to ease your mind
And all you needed was a just little of time

Oh, winter's passed, spring and fall
You never wrote me, you never called
(Yeah) Nathan Jones, you've been gone too long
Gone too long (Gone too long)

If a woman could die of tears
Nathan Jones, I wouldn't be here
The key that you're holding won't fit my door
And there's no room in my heart for you no more

Here comes that rainy day feelin' again

Leftover memories of Sunday
Always spent with you
Before the clouds appeared

The rainy days will go away

Misty mornin' eyes
I'm tryin' to disguise

I remember to this day the bright red Georgia clay
And how it stuck to the tires after the summer rain
Will power made that old car go
A woman's mind told me that so
Oh how I wish we were back on the road again

[Chorus]
Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

[Verse 2]
I can still recall the wheat fields of St. Paul
And the morning we got caught robbing from an old hen
Old McDonald he made us work
But then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas and back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

I'll never forget the day we motored stately into big L.A
The lights of the city put settling down in my brain
Though it's only been a month or so
That old car's bugging us to go
We've gotta get away and get back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

111,Rose Garden,Rose Garden,Lynn Anderson,1971,175866,60,"

[Chorus]
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
When you take you gotta give so live and let live or let go
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden

[Verse 1]
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well, if sweet talkin' you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter?

[Pre-Chorus]
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

[Chorus]
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden

[Verse 2]
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you, I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talkin' about

[Pre-Chorus]
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain sometime

Been forty days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know, know what I mean?

I just saw her yesterday
I just saw her, asked her to stay
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, Do you know what I mean?

Her and Bobby were steppin' out
Her and Bobby didn't know I found out
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know, know what I mean?

So I asked her if she still cared
She didn't hear me, she just stared
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, Do you know what I mean?

And then she said
Lee you haven't loved me in nearly four years
You haven't noticed that I held back my tears
And now you have, but it's really too late
Better find yourself another girl
Better find another girl
Better find uh, another place

{Pause}

She just left me yesterday
She just left me, had nothing to say
Do you know what I mean?
Oh, do you know what I mean?

She's a dandy, yes indeed
She's a dandy, but now she's free
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean? Yeah

Been forty days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend

Dancing alone every night while I live right above you
I can hear your music playin'

If you look out your window tonight
Pulling the string with the note that's attached to my heart
Read how many times I saw you
How in my silence I adored you
And only in my dreams did that wall between us come apart

Hush now, child
And don't you cry
Your folks might understand you
By and by
Just move on up
Toward your destination
Though you may find, from time to time, complication

Bite your lip
And take a trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip
Just move on up
For peace you'll find
Into the steeple of beautiful people
Where there's only one kind

So hush now, child
And don't you cry
Your folks might understand you
By and by
Move on up
And keep on wishin'
Remember your dream is your only scheme
So keep on pushin'

Take nothing less
Than the supreme best
Do not obey rumors people say
'Cause you can pass the test
Just move on up
To a greater day
With just a little faith
If you put your mind to it, you can surely do it

Just move on up
Move on up
But move on up
Oh, child, but just a-move on up
But move on up
Move on up

But I'll never use it, girl, if I don't have you

[Chorus]
Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, honey
Take my heart, my soul, my money
But don't leave me drownin' in my tears

Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe
I'll just lay me down and cry for a hundred years
Don't pull your love out on me, baby
If you do then I think that maybe

[Verse 1]
There once was a woman
A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery
I loved her
Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said, ""I ain't for taking, won't you ever learn?""

[Chorus]
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman

[Verse 2]
She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy, you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better, she said
""Saturday nights from now on baby, you're my star""
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman

Ooh my soul, I love you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She finally said she loved me
I wed her in a hurry
No more callers and I glowed with pride

I'm dreaming
I feel like screaming
I won my woman just before she died

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Who do you think you are?
Superstar
Who do you think you are?
Superstar
Superstar
Who do we think we are?
Oh my soul, I love you baby

[Verse 1:]
My father sits at night with no lights on
His cigarette glows in the dark
The living room is still
I walk by, no remark

I tiptoe past the master bedroom where
My mother reads her magazines
I hear her call sweet dreams
But I forgot how to dream

[Chorus:]
But you say it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own
You and me

Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me
We'll marry

[Verse 2:]
My friends from college
They're all married now
They have their houses and their lawns
They have their silent noons
Tearful nights, angry dawns

Their children hate them for the things they're not
They hate themselves for what they are
And yet they drink, they laugh
Close the wound
Hide the scar

[Chorus:]
But you say it's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own
You and me

Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me
We'll marry

[Verse 3:]
You say we can keep our love alive
Babe, all I know is what I see
The couples cling and claw
And drown in love's debris

You say we'll soar like two birds through the clouds
But soon you'll cage me on your shelf
I'll never learn to be just me first
By myself

[Chorus:]
Well, O.K
It's time we moved in together
And raised a family of our own
You and me

Well, that's the way I've always heard it should be
You want to marry me
We'll marry
We'll marry

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show

Yes, if he said he loved me

133,Have You Seen Her,The Ultimate Chi-Lites,The Chi-Lites,2006,310746,44,"

One month ago today
I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park

And have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know, tomorrow is their future
But for me just another day

They all gather around me
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain

Well, I know I can't hide from a memory
'Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Why, oh why
Did she have to leave and go away, oh yeah
Oh, I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost
Baby, I'm lost

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, she left her kiss upon my lips
But left that break within my heart
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, I see her hand reaching out to me
Only she can set me free
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Why Oh why?
Did you have to leave and go away? Oh yeah
Ooh oh, I've been used to having someone to lean on
And I'm lost, baby I'm lost

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

As another day comes to an end
I'm lookin' for a letter or somethin'
Anything that she would send
With all the people I know
I'm still a lonely man
You know, it's funny
But I thought I had her in the palm of my hand

Have you seen her
Tell me, have you seen her (tell me, have you seen her?)

Oh doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me

There'll never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart
She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely
With her around, who could be lonely
I reach for her hand, it's always there
How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there

From now on that's all I want to do
From the first time we met I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love for you

After all this time of being alone
We can love one another
Feel for each other from now on
Feels so good I can hardly stand it

Never ending love for you
From now on that's all I want to do
From the first time we met I knew
I'd sing my never ending song of love for you

It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky
It's just impossible
It's impossible, ask a baby not to cry
It's just impossible

Can I hold you closer to me
And not feel you going through me
Split the second that I never think of you
Oh, how impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever want for more
It's just impossible

And tomorrow
Should you ask me for the world, somehow I'd get it
I would sell my very soul and not regret it
For to live without your love
It's just impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever want for more
It's just impossible

And tomorrow
Should you ask me for the world, somehow I'd get it
I would sell my very soul and not regret it
For to live without your love
It's just impossible
Impossible, mmm
Impossible

Some people are made of plastic
And you know some people are made of wood
Some people have hearts of stone
Some people are up to no good

But baby, I'm for real
I'm as real as real can get
If what you're looking for is real loving
Then what you see is what you get

What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
I said, what you see (what you see) is what you get now, baby (is what you get)
And the real thing is the best thing yet (the best thing yet)

You know some people are made of lies
To bring you down and shame your name
But baby, I have good intentions
'Cause breaking hearts just ain't my game

All I want to do is love you
And sugar, I won't fill you with regret, no, no
If what you're looking for is real loving
Then what you see is what you get

What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
What you see (what you see) is what you get (is what you get)
I mean, what you see (what you see) is what you get now, baby (is what you get)

If I were your woman and you were my man
You'd have no other woman, you'd be weak as a lamb
If you had the strength to walk out that door
My love would over rule my sense and i'd call you back for more
If I were your woman, if you were my woman
If I were your woman, if you were my woman
And you were my man, yeah
Yeah, she tears you down, darling, says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up, darling, when she lets you fall
You're like a diamond but she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you but me you don't ask
If I were your woman, if you were my woman
If I were your woman, if you were my woman
If I were your woman, if you were my woman
Here's what I'd do, I'd never no, no, no stop loving you, yeah, yeah
Life is so crazy and love is unkind
Because she came first, darling, will she hang on your mind?
You're a part of me and you don't even know it
I'm what you need but I'm too afraid to show it
If I were your woman, if you were my woman
If I were your woman, if you were my woman

Riding along my pushbike honey
When I noticed you
Riding down town in a hurry honey
Down South Avenue
You looked so pretty
As you were riding along
You looked so pretty
As you were singing this song

Put on the speed
And I tried catching up
But you were pedaling harder too
Riding along like a hurricane honey
Spinning out of view
You looked so pretty
As you were riding along
You looked so pretty
As you were singing this song
Sing this song

Round round wheels going
Round round round
Down up Pedals going
Down up down
But I got to get across to
The other side of town
Before the sun goes down

Now we're riding along on our bicycle honey
That's a bicycle built for two
I'm looking at my honey in the rear view mirror
Now I got a better view
You looked so pretty
As you were riding along
You looked so pretty
As you were singing this song
Sing this song

Round round wheels going
Round round round
Down up Pedals going
Down up down
But I got to get across to
The other side of town
Before the sun goes down

Do you recall
Some years ago?
Up in the mountains that were white with snow
Inside a cavern
McDougal he was plannin'
There's gonna be a showdown with somebody he knows

Well he's been there
A year or so
Someday will happen very soon I know
I hear him playin' his bagpipes every mornin'
I think that it's a warnin'
He's gatherin' the clan

Soon you'll hear the sound of people shoutin'
You will see the claymores in their hands
If you knew the reason for their fightin'
You would never understand

Oh Tweedle Dee
Oh Tweedle Dum
The tune McDougal always used to hum
While he was fightin' his rival clan McGregor
Dishonour he would never
The tartan of his clan

152,American Pie,The Best Of Don McLean,Don McLean,1988-01-01,515866,68,"

[Intro]
A long, long time ago
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

[Chorus]
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 1]
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock 'n roll
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

[Chorus]
I started singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 2]
Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

[Chorus]
We were singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 3]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

[Chorus]
We started singin', ""Bye-bye, Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

[Verse 4]
Oh, and there we were, all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

[Chorus]
We were singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die...""

[Breakdown]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The father, son, and the holy ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

[Deleted Verse]
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

[Chorus]
And they were singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die""
""This'll be the day that I die""

[Outro]
They were singin', ""Bye-bye Miss American Pie""
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die...""

They'd be your partner

You had me several years ago
When I was still quite naive
Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, and

And your horse naturally won
Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun

And when you're not, you're with
Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
Wife of a close friend, and

You're so vain
I'll bet you think this song is about you

On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

[Chorus]
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

[Chorus]
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

[Verse 3]
After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

[Chorus]
You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
La, la, la lala la la la, la, la

160,Vincent,American Pie,Don McLean,1971,239866,47,"

[Verse 1]
Starry, starry night
Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

[Chorus]
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

[Verse 2]
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

[Chorus]
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

[Bridge]
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you

[Verse 3]
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn; a bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

[Outro]
Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will

[Verse 1]
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

[Verse 2]
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

[Pre-Chorus]
But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

[Chorus]
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Woo!
Get it

[Verse 1]
In the mornin' don't say you love me
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door
I know your name is Rita 'cause your perfume's smelling sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor, guitar

[Verse 2]
You won't need too much pursuadin'
I don't mean to sound degradin'
But with a face like that
You got nothin' to laugh about
Red lips, hair and fingernails
I hear you're a mean old Jezebel
Let's go upstairs
And read my tarot cards, come on

Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me, oh yeah
Stay with me, stay with me
For tonight you'd better stay with me

So, in the mornin', please don't say you love me
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door
Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up, come on, honey

Stay with me, stay with me

Stay with me, stay with me

[Chorus]
No, I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away

[Verse 1]
Oh, little darling of mine
I can't for the life of me
Remember a sadder day
I know they say let it be
But it just don't work out that way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again

No, I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away

Oh, little darling of mine
I just can't believe it's so
Though it seems strange to say
I never been laid so low
In such a mysterious way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again

But I would not give you false hope (No)
On this strange and mournful day
When the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away

Oh, the mother and child reunion, oh, is only a motion away

[Verse 1]
I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they all knew my name
No one recognized me, I didn't look the same

[Chorus]
But it's all right now, I learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself

[Verse 2]
And people came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
An' over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes wearing his disguise

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came
No one heard the music, we didn't look the same
I said, hello to ""Mary Lou"", she belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lotta luck
But if memories were all I sang, I rather drive a truck

You sing 'em out again

And before you know it get to feeling good

Just to walk with you along the Milky Way
To caress you through the nighttime
Bring you flowers every day
Oh, babe, what would you say?

And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand

To see the evil and the good without hiding

Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long?

And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will

Tell me what you see

Just say if it's too late for me

Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no names
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

[Chorus]
Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
Won't you pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

[Chorus]
Nighttime on The City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his song again
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
And Momma just hung her head and said

""Son, Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone.""
Well, well

""Hey Mama, is it true what they say
That Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, some bad talk goin' round town
Sayin' that Papa had three outside children and another wife
And that ain't right
Heard them talking Papa doing some store front preachin'
Talked about saving souls and all the time leaching
Dealing in debt, and stealing in the name of the Lord""
Mama just hung her head and said

""Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Hey, Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone.""
Uh

""Hey Mama, I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal to pay his bills
Hey Mama, folks say that Papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth""
And Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said

""Son, Papa was a rolling stone
(Well, well, well, well)
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
Lone, lone, lone, alone

Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone
I said, Papa was a rolling stone, yes he was
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died all he left us was alone..""

My daddy was
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home

When I saw you standing there
I'bout fell off my chair
And when you moved your mouth to speak
I felt the blood go to my feet

Now, it took time for me to know
What you tried so not to show
Something in my soul just cried
I see the want in your blue eyes

Baby, I'd love you to want me
The way that I want you
The way that it should be
Mmm, baby, you'd love me to want you
The way that I want to
If you'd only let it be

You told yourself years ago
You'd never let your feelings show
The obligation that you made
For the title that they gave

Baby, I'd love you to want me

The Cork and Kerry mountains

176,You Wear It Well,Never A Dull Moment,Rod Stewart,1972,262960,48,"

I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
But to settle down and write you a line
I've been meaning to phone you but from Minnesota
Hell it's been a very long time
You wear it well
A little old fashioned but that's all right

Well I suppose you're thinking I bet he's sinking
Or he wouldn't get in touch with me
Oh I ain't begging or losing my head
I sure do want you to know that you wear it well
There ain't a lady in the land so fine

Remember them basement parties, your brother's karate
The all day rock and roll shows
Them homesick blues and radical views
Haven't left a mark on you, you wear it well
A little out of time but I don't mind

But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out
Tryin' to get a letter through

Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it did not cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire and you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you

Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told
That I gotta get back to work
So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone
Think of me and try not to laugh and I wear it well
I don't object if you call collect
'cos I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even tryin'
Now I'm eatin' my heart out tryin' to get back to you

I love you, I love you, I love you

After all the years I hope it's the same address
Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on

[Verse]
He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin’ home to a place he’d never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door

When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin’ by a song
But the string’s already broken and he doesn’t really care
It keeps changin’ fast and it don’t last for long

[Chorus]
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)

[Verse]
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept the memory

Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual reply
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)

[Verse]
Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of the simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down
To bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land

[Chorus]
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
Though he'd be a poorer man if he never saw eagles fly
Rocky Mountain high

The Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high (high  high)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado)
Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado)

[Verse 1]
The first time, ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and the stars
Were the gifts you gave
To the dark, and the endless skies
My Love

[Verse 2]
And the first time, ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there, at my command
My Love

[Verse 3]
And the first time, ever I lay with you
I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy
Would fill the earth
And last, 'til the end of time
My Love
And last, 'til the end of time
My love

The first time, ever I saw
Your face
Your face
Your fa-ace

Well, I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it

They don't abuse it
Never gonna lose it
I can't refuse it

Well, I've never been to England
But I kinda like the Beatles
Well, I headed for Las Vegas
Only made it out to Needles

Can you feel it?
Must be near it
Feels so good
Oh, it feels so good

Well, I've never been to heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
Oh, they tell me I was born there
But I really don't remember

In Oklahoma, not Arizona
What does it matter?

181,Goodbye To Love,A Song For You,Carpenters,1972,238266,51,"

I'll say goodbye to love
No-one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it

So I've made my mind up I must live my life alone
And though it's not the easy way, I guess I've always known
I'd say goodbye to love
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
And to live for something I could live for

All the years of useless search have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days will be my only friend
From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I can

What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song
And it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to love

How much I really love you
Ain’t that the prettiest thing?

Sunshine, go away today

He don’t know what he's asking
When he tells me I better get in line
I can't hear a word he's saying
When I grow up, I'm gonna make it mine
Oh, these ain't been dues I been paying

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it

He can’t even run his own life
Damned if he'll run mine, sunshine

Sunshine, go away today

The fruits of what I do are going
When he said in love and war, all is fair
But Nixon got cards he ain't showing

How much does it cost?

And he can't even run his own life

Saturday night I was downtown
Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high

Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman singing a song

A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9"" beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

Woo!

I saw her head up to the table
With a tall walking big black cat
Well, Charlie said ""I hope that you're able, boy
'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at""
When suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
I jumped down and across the table
When I heard somebody shooting a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
And then she was a-holding my right
Well, I told her ""Don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared""

Well I've gotta be forgiven
If I wanna spend my living
With a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9"" beautiful tall
Well, with just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all
Had it all, had it all
Had it all, had it all

For your dreams are all I believe

Meet me on the corner when the lights are coming on
And I'll be there, I promise I'll be there
Down the empty streets we'll disappear until the dawn
If you have dreams enough to share

Lay down your bundles of rags and reminders
And spread your wares on the ground
Well I've got time, if you deal in rhyme
I'm just hanging around

Meet me on the corner when the lights are coming on
And I'll be there, I promise I'll be there
Down the empty streets we'll disappear until the dawn

189,Taxi,Heads & Tales,Harry Chapin,1972,406146,45,"

It was raining hard in 'Frisco
I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light

Oh, where you going to, my lady blue
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain
She just looked out the window, and said
""Sixteen Parkside Lane""

Something about her was familiar
I could swear I'd seen her face before
But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more

It took a while, but she looked in the mirror
And she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile, just the same
And she said, ""How are you Harry?""
I said, ""How are you Sue?
Through the too many miles
And the too little smiles
I still remember you.""

It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of the Dodge
The lesson hadn't gone too far
You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off to find the sky

Oh, I've got something inside me
To drive a princess blind
There's a wild man, wizard
He's hiding in me, illuminating my mind
Oh, I've got something inside me
Not what my life's about
Cause I've been letting my outside tide me
Over 'till my time, runs out

Baby's so high that she's skying
Yes she's flying, afraid to fall
I'll tell you why baby's crying
Cause she's dying, aren't we all

There was not much more for us to talk about
Whatever we had once was gone
So I turned my cab into the driveway
Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns
And she said we must get together
But I knew it'd never be arranged
And she handed me twenty dollars
For a two fifty fare, she said
""Harry, keep the change.""
Well another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go...
I stashed the bill in my shirt

And she walked away in silence
It's strange, how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long, long time ago

You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off for the sky
And here, she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flying in my taxi
Taking tips, and getting stoned
I go flying so high, when I'm stoned

193,Brandy (You're a Fine Girl),Looking Glass,Looking Glass,1972,186826,73,"

[Verse 1]
There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their homes

[Verse 2]
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say ""Brandy, fetch another round""
She serves them whiskey and wine

[Chorus 1]
The sailors say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
Yeah, your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea""

[Verse 3]
Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved

[Verse 4]
He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home

[Chorus 2]
The sailor said, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea""

[Bridge]
Yeah, Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailor's story
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth
Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand

[Verse 5]
At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say

[Outro]
She hears him say, ""Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea
It is, yes, it is""

""Brandy, you're a fine girl
(You're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(Such a fine girl)
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea
It is, it is, yes, it is""

I stopped sending flowers to your apartment
You said you aren't at home much anymore
I stopped dropping by without an appointment
'Cause I'd hear laughter coming through your door

Sometimes late at night you'll still call me
Just before you close your eyes to sleep
You make me vow to try and stop by sometime
But baby, that's a promise I can't keep

I love you too much to ever start liking you
So let's just let the story kinda end
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So don't expect for me to be your friend

I don't walk down through the village or other places
That we used to go to all the time
I'm trying to erase you from my memory
'Cause thinking of you jumbles up my mind

I love you too much to ever start liking you
So let's just let the story kinda end
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So don't expect for me to be your friend

You always act so happy when I see you
You smile that way, you take my hand and then...
Introduce me to your latest lover
That's when I feel the walls start crashing in

I love you too much to ever start liking you
So let's just let the story kinda end
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So don't expect for me to be your friend

Uptown got its hustlers
The bowery got its bums
42nd Street got Big Jim Walker
He's a pool-shootin' son of a gun
Yeah, he big and dumb as a man can come
But he stronger than a country hoss
And when the bad folks all get together at night
You know they all call big Jim ""Boss"", just because
And they say

You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Jim""

Well outta south Alabama come a country boy
He said, ""I'm lookin' for a man named Jim
I am a pool-shootin' boy, my name's Willie McCoy
But down at home they call me Slim
Yeah I'm lookin' for the king of 42nd Street
He drivin' a drop top Cadillac
Last week he took all my money, and it may sound funny
But I come to get my money back""
And everybody say, ""Jack don't you know

Well, a hush fell over the pool room
Jimmy come boppin' in off the street
And when the cuttin' was done
The only part that wasn't bloody
Was the soles of the big man's feet, ooh
And he was cut in about a hundred places
And he was shot in a couple more
And you better believe
They sung a different kind of story
When big Jim hit the floor now, they say

[Chorus]
You don't tug on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don't mess around with Slim

Find out where it's at
And it's not hustlin' people strange to you
Even if you do got a two-piece custom-made pool cue

Don't start clinging to me, girl

Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me

Girl, you're a hot-blooded woman-child
And it's warm where you're touching me
But I can tell by your trembling smile
You're seein' way too much in me

Girl, don't let your life get tangled up with mine
Cause I'll just leave you
I can't take no clinging vine

Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me

Goodbye for the summer
Baby, I promise you this
I'll send you all my love

Sealed with a kiss

Cold, lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss

I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But baby, you won't be there

I don't wanna say
Goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
So, let us make a pledge
To meet in September
And seal it with a kiss

215,Cherish - remastered,The Definitive Collection,David Cassidy,1974,227266,37,"

Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have
Hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times
I wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times
I wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times
I've wished that I could mold you into someone
Who could cherish me as much as I cherish you

Perish is the word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not going to be the one
To share your dreams
That I am not going to be the one
To share your schemes
That I am not going to be the one
To share what seems to be the life
That you could cherish me as much as I do yours

Oh, I'm beginning to think
That man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters
Just the right sound
That could make you hear
Make you see
That you're driving me out of my mind

Oh I could say I need you
But then you'd realize that I want you
Just like a thousand other guys
Who say they'd love you
With all the rest of their lives
When all they wanted was to
Touch your face, your hands
And gaze into your eyes

Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times
I wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times
I wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times
I wished that I could mold you into someone
That could cherish me as much as I cherish you

And I do
Cherish you
And I do
I cherish you
Yes I do
I cherish you

There were times in the days gone by
When I thought I was living, having fun with all the friends I knew
Now it seems all so long ago
For my life changed completely from the moment I met you

Come what may, I will love you forever
And forever my heart belongs to you
Come what may, for as long as I'm livin'
I'll be living only for you

Now I know I was lost till I met you
When I met you, love told me what to do
Come what may, in a world full of changes
Nothing changes my love for you

Never ask what the past was like
I will live for tomorrow, yesterday is very far away
Now you're here, everything is new
You are all that I long for, and I long for you to stay

Come what may, I will love you forever
And forever my heart belongs to you
Come what may, for as long as I'm livin'

Now I know I was lost till I met you

There's this thing called love
And it's everywhere

I believe I'm falling in love

At least ten times a day
You know, it's so unusual for me
To carry on this way

I'll tell you, I can't sleep at night
Wanting to hold her tight
I've tried so hard to convince myself
That this feeling just can't be right
And I'm telling you

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of

And yet
We're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all

Oh, oh
And yet
We're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all
We're not too young

Hiawatha didn't bother too much
About Minnie Ha-Ha and her tender touch
Till she took him to the silver stream
Then she whispered words like he'd never heard
That made him all shudder inside when she said

Try a little touch, try a little too much
Just try a little wig-wam bam

About Little White Dove and her tender love
Till she took him to the silver stream
She told him all about what he couldn't live without
And made him all weak inside when she said

235,The Young New Mexican Puppeteer,Tom Jones Close Up,Tom Jones,1972-06-01,273093,37,"

In a town near Albuquerque
Lived a most concerned young boy
He said lately I have noticed
Folks don't live with peace and joy

With frowns and worry on their faces
They're lost and don't know where to go
He said I'll get the people straightened
By putting on a puppet show

The young New Mexican puppeteer
He saw the people all lived in fear
He thought that maybe they'd listen to
A puppet telling them what to do

You know he got some string and he got some wood
He did some carving and he was good
And folks came running so they could hear
The young New Mexican puppeteer

First he carved out young Abe Lincoln
Abe will teach 'em civil rights
Then a King named Martin Luther
So they'd recall his peaceful fight

Old Mark Twain, his wit and wisdom
Will surely show them life is fun
But he smiled with satisfaction
When the Prince of Peace was done

The young New Mexican puppeteer
He saw the people all lived in fear
He thought that maybe they'd listen to
A puppet telling them what to do

You know he got some string and he got some wood
He did some carving and he was good
And folks came running so they could hear
The young New Mexican puppeteer

Now his puppet shows were clever
And he made the people laugh
When he got across the message
To walk along life's open path

They built him his own puppet theatre
Decked out with spotlights yellow and red
And then they wrote him up in all the papers
And this is what the story said

It said...

The young New Mexican puppeteer
He saw the people all lived in fear
He thought that maybe they would listen to
A puppet telling them what to do

You know he got some string and he got some wood
He did some carving and he was good
And folks came running so they could hear
The young New Mexican puppeteer

[Verse 1]
Very superstitious
Writing's on the wall
Very superstitious
Ladder's about to fall
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
The good things in your past

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Verse 2]
Very superstitious
Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong
You don't want to save me
Sad is my song

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Verse 3]
Very superstitious
Nothing more to say
Very superstitious
The devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
Good things in your past

When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
No, no, no

You see them long trains runnin'
And you watch 'em disappear

You know I saw Miss Lucy
Down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family
And she won't be coming back

Without love
Where would you be right now?
Without love

Well, the Illinois Central

238,Crocodile Rock,Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player,Elton John,1973-01-22,235440,71,"

[Verse 1]
I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

[Post-Chorus]
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa

[Verse 2]
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

[Chorus]
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

And brought them all together for one night
I know they’d never match my sweet imagination
Everything looks worse in black and white

They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world’s a sunny day, oh yeah

Your everlasting summer
And you can see it fading fast
So you grab a piece of something
That you think is gonna last
Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond
If you held it in your hand
The things you think are precious
I can't understand

[Chorus]
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?

[Verse 2]
You been tellin' me you're a genius
Since you were seventeen
In all the time I've known you
I still don't know what you mean
The weekend at the college
Didn't turn out like you planned
The things that pass for knowledge
I can't understand

[Chorus]
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?

I spend a lot of money
And I spent a lot of time
The trip we made to Hollywood
Is etched upon my mind
After all the things we've done and seen
You find another man
The things you think are useless
I can't understand

[Chorus]
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?
Are you reelin' in the years?
Stowin' away the time?
Are you gatherin' up the tears?
Have you had enough of mine?

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

La, la-la, di-dee-da

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

[Verse 3]
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Who do you think you’re fooling?”

Oh, my mama loves me, she loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Oh, she loves me like a rock
She rock me like the rock of ages
And she loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me

When I was grown to be a man
And the Devil would call my name
I’d say “now who do
Who do you think you’re fooling?”

I’m a consummated man
I can snatch a little purity
My mama loves me, she loves me
She get down on her knees and hug me
Oh, she loves me like a rock
She rock me like the rock of ages
And loves me
She love me, love me, love me, love me

And If I was the President
The minute the Congress called my name

Such a feeling's coming over me
There is wonder in most everything I see
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream

Everything I want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here/near
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

[Chorus]
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a day that I could give you
I'd give to you the day just like today
If I had a song that I could sing for you
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a tale that I could tell you
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
If I had a wish that I could wish for you
I'd make a wish for sunshine for all the while

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
Sunshine almost all the time makes me high

Went out in the world too much for my nerves
Only myself to blame

Nobody else to blame...

Stand on my head and say

Is the baddest part of town
And if you go down there
You better just beware
Of a man named Leroy Brown

Now Leroy more than trouble
You see he stand 'bout six foot four
All the downtown ladies call him ""Treetop Lover""
All the men just call him ""Sir""

The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong

And he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a 32 gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than old King Kong

Well Friday bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And ooh that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
Leroy Brown he learned a lesson
'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown
The baddest man in the whole damn town

With a couple of pieces gone

For a guy to spend his time

The book of life is brief
And once the page is read
All but life is dead
That is my belief

And yes I know
How lonely life can be
The shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me

VERSE 1
Take off your hat, kick off your shoes
I know you ain't going anywhere
Run round the town singing your blues
I know you ain't going anywhere

CHORUS 1
You've always been a good friend of mine
But you're always saying farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

VERSE 2
Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself
Or is that what you're trying to do?
Put up a fight you believe to be right
And someday the sun will shine through

CHORUS 2
You've always got something to hide
Something you just can't tell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

MIDDLE EIGHT
And I know what you're wishing for
Love and a peaceful world
Love and a peaceful world
Love and a peaceful world
Love and a peaceful world

CHORUS 1

I wish you well
The wishing well
Everybody has a wish
Everybody has a dream
I wish you well
You have to dream your own dream

We're still together after all that we've been through
They tried to tell you I was not the boy for you
They didn't like my hair
The clothes I love to wear
They didn't realise that I was strong enough for two

I love you love
You love me too love
I love you love me love
I love you love
My only true love
I love you love me love

The things they said about the two of us were lies
I knew they couldn't see the love light in your eyes
They said I wouldn't dare
To show how much I care
They didn't know that we were just two angels in disguise

I love you love
You love me too love
I love you love me love
I love you love
My only true love
I love you love me love

So here we are alone
We made it on our own
And though they tried
They can't deny
The way we really showed them

I love you love
You love me too love
I love you love me love
I love you love
My only true love
I love you love me love

I love you love
You love me too love
I love you love me love

And I'll never go away again

Won't you try to love me? Help me?

Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak
So sleep, silent angel, go to sleep

Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe

318,Rikki Don't Lose That Number,Pretzel Logic,Steely Dan,1974-01-01,271093,61,"

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We hear you're leaving, that's okay
I thought our little wild time had just begun
I guess you kind of scared yourself, you turn and run
But if you have a change of heart

[Chorus]
Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home

[Verse 2]
I have a friend in town, he's heard your name
We can go out driving on Slow Hand Row
We could stay inside and play games, I don't know
And you could have a change of heart

[Chorus]
Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home

[Instrumental break 2:50-3:30]
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
You tell yourself you're not my kind
But you don't even know your mind
And you could have a change of heart

[Chorus]
Rikki, don't lose that number
You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki, don't lose that number
It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home

[Outro]
Rikki, don't lose that number
(Rikki, don't lose that number)
Rikki, don't lose that number

[Chorus]
You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest
Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses, come fill me again

Come let me love you, let me give my life to you
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms
Let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you
Come let me love you, come love me again

(Let me give my life to you
Come let me love you, come love me again)

[Chorus]
You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest
Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses, come fill me again

[Chorus]
So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
To rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby

Rock the boat
Don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat

[Verse 1]
Ever since our voyage of love began
Your touch has thrilled me
Like the rush of the wind
And your arms have held me
Safe from a rolling sea
There's always been a quiet place
To harbor you and me

Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo
Full of love and devotion

[Chorus]
So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion
To rock the boat
Don't rock the boat, baby

[Verse 2:]
Up to now
We sailed through every storm
And I've always had your tender lips
To keep me warm

Oh, I need to have the strength
That flows from you
Don't let me drift away my dear
When love can see me through

Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo
Full of love and devotion

[Chorus]
So I'd like to know where you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where you got the notion

321,Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me,Caribou,Elton John,1974-06-28,336733,61,"

[Verse 1]
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

[Verse 2]
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Verse 3]
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Chorus]
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

322,Long Tall Glasses (I Can Dance),Just A Boy,Leo Sayer,1974,192013,37,"

I was travellin' down the road feelin' hungry and cold
I saw a sign sayin' ""Food and Drinks for Everyone""
So naturally, I thought I would take me a look inside
I saw so much food there was water coming from my eyes

Yeah, there was ham and there was turkey, there was caviar
And long tall glasses with wine up to y'are
Then somebody grabbed me, threw me out of my chair
Said, ""Before you can eat, you gotta dance like Fred Astaire""

You know I can't dance, you know I can't dance
You know I can't dance, you know I can't dance, I can't dance!

I am a man of the road, a hobo by name
I don't seek entertainment, just poultry and game
But if it's all the same to you then yes, I will try my hand
If you were hungry as me then I'm sure you will understand

Hmm, now wait a minute, of course I can dance
Of course I can dance, I'm sure I can dance
I'm sure I can dance, I can dance
I can dance, I really hit the floor, ah, it feels good
Look at me dancin'!

I did a Two Step, Quick Step and a Bossanova
A little Victor Sylvester and a Rudy Valentino
You should have seen me moving right across the floor
Hand me down my tuxedo, next week I'm coming back for more

I can dance, oh yes, I can dance
Look at me dance on the floor movin'
I feel good, I can dance, I can dance
I can dance, I can dance, I can dance, I can dance

Tell me, would we?
Could we?

May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget

In her satin dress
In a room where you do
What you don't confess

Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round

In a sailor's dream
And she don't always say
What she really means

When I get feelin' better
When I'm feelin' no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better

That a man could make
Getting lost in her lovin'
Is your first mistake

When I feel like I'm winnin'

In her faded jeans
She's a hard lovin' woman
Got me feelin' mean

Sometimes I think it's a shame

Daddy was a cop on the east side of Chicago
Back in the U.S.A., back in the bad old days

In the heat of a summer night
In the land of the dollar bill
When the town of Chicago died
And they talk about it still

When a man named Al Capone
Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
With the forces of the law

I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was
Glory be!

I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw
Yes indeed!

And the sound of the battle rang
Through the streets of the old east side
'Til the last of the hoodlum gang
Had surrendered up or died

There was shouting in the street
And the sound of running feet
And I asked someone who said
""''Bout a hundred cops are dead!""

And he kissed my mama's face
And he brushed her tears away

[Verse 1]
Help me, I think I'm falling in love again
When I get that crazy feeling, I know I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble 'cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet taIking ladies man and you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

[Verse 2]
Help me, I think I'm falling in love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom

[Verse 3]
Didn't it feel good, we were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking, didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good
Didn't it feel good

[Verse 4]
Help me, I think I'm falling in love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around flirting and flirting, hurting too
We love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom

Living his grey flannel life
But when he turns off to sleep
Old memories creep
More, more, more!

And worked day and night to earn our daily bread
And every day Emma would go out searching for that play
That never ever came her way

I'd hear her crying in the back room feeling so distressed
And I'd remember back when she was five
To the words that used to make Emmalene come alive

To find her lying still and cold up on the bed

I tried so very hard not to leave you alone
I just can't keep on tryin' no more.""

You live your life in the songs you hear
On the rock'n'roll radio
And when a young girl
Doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go

Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you outta school
You're a little touched you know
Angie baby

[Hook]

Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door

Angie girl, are you alright
Tell the radio good night
All alone once more
Angie baby

Angie baby
You're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe

Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At night through her window blind

""I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today
I'll show you how to have a good time
Angie baby""

Angie baby
Angie baby

When he walks in her room
He feels confused like he's walked into a play
And the music's so loud
It spins him around
'Til his soul has lost its way

And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found

[Hook]

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover who keeps her satisfied

It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side

Angie baby
You're a special lady
Living in a world of make-believe
Well, maybe
Well, maybe

But fate's been kind, the downs have been few
I guess you could say that I've been lucky
Well, I guess you could say that it's all because of you

For whatever reason there might be
Ooo, you'll be there between each line of pain and glory
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me
Ah, you're the best thing that ever happened to me

Oh, there have been times when times were hard
But always somehow I made it, I made it through
'Cause for every moment that I've spent hurting
There was a moment that I spent, ah, just loving you

If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever reason there might be
Oh, you'll be there between each line of pain and glory

Have you seen the old man
In the closed-down market
Kicking up the paper
With his worn out shoes?
In his eyes you see no pride
And held loosely at his side
Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old girl
Who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
She's no time for talking
She just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

In the all night cafe
At a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world
Over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour
And he wanders home alone

So how can you tell me you're lonely
Don't say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man
Outside the Seaman's Mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
In our winter city
The rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero
And a world that doesn't care

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and
Lead you through the streets of London
Show you something to make you change your mind

And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow

Try to remember that kind of September, when
When life was slow and oh, so mellow, hum

Oh, why does it seem the past is always better
We look back and think
The winters were warmer
The grass was greener
The skies were bluer
And smiles were bright

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
And if we had the chance to do it all again

Would we

370,Time in a Bottle,You Don't Mess Around With Jim,Jim Croce,1972-04-01,146175,66,"

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
If I could save time in a bottle
The first thing that I'd like to do
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
Just to spend them with you

[Verse 2]
If I could make days last forever
If words could make wishes come true
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
Again, I would spend them with you

[Chorus]
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

[Verse 3]
If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty, except for the memory of how
They were answered by you

[Chorus]
But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

372,Far Far Away,Slade in Flame,Slade,1974-01-01,214720,53,"

[Verse 1]
I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi
I've seen the bridges of the world and they're for real

[Bridge]
I've had a red light off-the-wrist
Without me even gettin' kissed
It still seems so unreal

[Verse 2]
I've seen the morning in the mountains of Alaska
I've seen the sun set in the East and in the West

[Pre-Chorus]
I've sang the glory that was Rome
And passed the ""Hound Dog"" singer's home
It still seems for the best

[Chorus]
And I'm far far away
With my head up in the clouds
And I'm far far away
With my feet down in the crowds
Lettin' loose around the world
But the call of home is loud
Still as loud

[Verse 3]
I've seen the Paris lights from high upon Montmartre
And felt the silence hanging low in No Man's Land
And though those Spanish nights were fine
It wasn't only from the wine
It still seems all in hand

[Chorus]
And I'm far far away
With my head up in the clouds
And I'm far far away
With my feet down in the crowds
Lettin' loose around the world
But the call of home is loud
Still as loud

[Verse 1]
I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi
The Grand Bahama Island stories carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
And though those arigato smiles
Stay in your memory for a while
There still seems more to come

[Chorus]
And I'm far far away
With my head up in the clouds
And I'm far far away
With my feet down in the crowds
Lettin' loose around the world
But the call of home is loud
Still as loud

[Chorus]
And I'm far far away
With my head up in the clouds
And I'm far far away
With my feet down in the crowds
And I'm far far away
But the sound of home is loud
Still as loud

Marvin:
My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world

First I had you
In the palm of my hand
But I let you slip through
Like grains of sand
At the beginning
When I didn't care
Like my own reflection
You were always there

My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

Diana:
You were sweeter
Then my very own skin
But what did I do for you
Not a thing
In front of my friends
You broke me down
Since then darling
It's hard to track you down

My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world

Marvin:
Many a smile
You put on my face
But I paid dearly
With the tears I taste

Diana:
My tenderness
Made you cold, not sweet
'Cause if a girl loves you
You only call her weak

Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all

Girl when you hold me
How you control me
You bend and you fold me
Any way you please

It must be easy for you
To love the things that you do
But just a pastime for you
I could never be

And I never know, girl
If I should stay or go
Cos the games that you play
Keep driving me away...
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love Me For a Reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love Me For a Reason
Let the reason be love

Kisses and caresses
Are only minor tests, babe
Of love turned to stresses
Between a woman and a man
So if love everlasting
Isn't what you're asking
I'll have to pass, girl
I'm proud to take a stand

I can't continue guessing
Because it's only messing
With my pride, and my mind
So write down this time to time

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love Me For a Reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love Me For a Reason
Let the reason be love

I'm just a little old-fashioned
It takes more than a physical attraction
My initial reaction is
Honey give me a love
Not a fascimile of

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love Me For a Reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl

[Verse 1]
The fortune queen of New Orleans
Was brushing her cat in her black limousine
On the back seat were scratches from
The marks of men, her fortune she had won
I couldn't see through the tinted glass;
She said, ""Home, James"" and he hit the gas
I followed her to some darkened room
She took my money, she said, ""I'll be with you soon""

[Chorus]
Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one;
Danced to her gypsy music
'Till her brew was done...
Dark lady played black magic
'Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself...

[Verse 2]
She dealt two cards, a queen and a three
And mumbled some words that were so strange to me
And then she turned up a two-eyed jack
My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black
She said, ""The man you love is secretly true
To someone else who is very close to you!
My advice is that you leave this place
Never come back, and forget you ever saw my face!""

[Chorus]
Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one;
Danced to her gypsy music
Till her brew was done...
Dark lady played black magic
Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself...

[Verse 3]
So I ran home and crawled in my bed
I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said
Then I remembered her strange perfume
And how I smelled it once in my own room
So I snuck back and caught her with my man;
Laughing and kissing til they saw the gun in my hand...
The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor--
Dark Lady would never turn a card up anymore!

[Chorus fades out]
Dark lady laughed and danced
And lit the candles one by one;
Danced to her gypsy music
Til her brew was done...
Dark lady played black magic
Till the clock struck on the twelve
She told me more about me
Than I knew myself...

Well I used to wake the mornin'
Before the rooster crowed
Searchin' for soda bottles
To get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner
Down to the country store
Cash 'em in and give my money
To a man named Curtis Loew

[Verse 2]
Old Curt was a black man
With white, curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine
He did not have a care
He used to own an old dobro
Used to play it 'cross his knee
I'd give old Curt my money
He'd play all day for me

[Chorus]
Play me a song
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues

[Verse 3]
He looked to be sixty
And maybe I was ten
Mama used to whoop me
But I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feets
Try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two
Then take another drink of wine

[Chorus]
Play me a song

Well I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues
Yes, sir

On the day old Curtis died
Nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words
And they chucked him in the clay
Well he lived a lifetime
Playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life
That's all he had to lose

Play me a song

I wish that you was here
So everyone would know
People said he was useless
Them people all are fools
'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker

Let the sideshow begin (hurry, hurry)
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

See the man who's been cryin' for a million years
So many tears (so many tears)
See the girl who's collected broken hearts for souvenirs
It's more exciting than a one man band
The saddest little show in all the land

So let the sideshow begin (hurry, hurry)
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

Let the sideshow begin
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

So let the sideshow begin (Hurry, hurry)
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

Let the sideshow begin (step right on in)
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry (hurry, hurry)

[Verse 1]
I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

[Chorus]
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

[Verse 2]
I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us

[Chorus]
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

[Interlude]
Be quiet, big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

Big boys don't cry
Big boys don't cry

[Verse 3]
I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me

[Chorus]
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

[Bridge]
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time

390,Mamma Mia,Abba,ABBA,1975,213266,75,"

[Verse 1]
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

[Verse 2]
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
""Bye-bye"", leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
""Bye-bye"" doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me

Oh, Mandy
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today
Oh, Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world
Of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming

Oh, Mandy
Well, you came
And you gave without taking
But I sent you away
Oh, Mandy
Well, you kissed me
And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today

I face the morning
Crying on a breeze
The pain is calling

And stopped me from shaking
And I need you today

And I'll say it again
While others pretend

Well I tried to make it Sunday

That I set my sights on Monday
And I got myself undressed
I ain't ready for the altar
But I do agree there's times
When a woman sure can be a friend of mine

Well, I keep on thinking about you

You ain't been on my mind

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me, you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

[Verse 1]
Carried your books from school
Playing make-believe you're married to me
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be

[Verse 2]
Walking home every day, over
Barnegat Bridge and Bay
'Til we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name

[Verse 4]
Funny, I seem to find
That no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss
And the love I left behind

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you
So close, so close
And yet so far

All my life I will remember
How warm and tender we were way back then
Though I'm feeling sad regrets
I know I won't ever forget you, my childhood friend

Though I never laid a hand on you

My eyes adored you

401,The Last Farewell,Roger Whittaker - The Best Of (1967 - 1975),Roger Whittaker,1985-01-01,220600,48,"

There's a ship lies rigged and ready in the harbor
Tomorrow for old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell

For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into Hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
And my ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return safe home again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

When I was in a hurry as you are
I was like you
There was a day
When I just had to tell my point of view
I was like you

Now I don't mean to make you frown
No, I just want you to slow down

Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried
To find a comfort from inside you?

Have you never been happy
Just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?

Running around as you do
With your head up in the clouds
I was like you
Never had time to lay back
Kick your shoes off, close your eyes
I was like you

Now you're not hard to understand
You need someone to take your hand, hey

Have you never been mellow?
Have you never tried
To find a comfort from inside you?

Have you never been happy
Just to hear your song?
Have you never let someone else be strong?

Reaching out, touching you
Leaving all the worries all behind
Loving you the way I do
My mouth on yours and yours on mine

Marry me, let me live with you
Nothing's wrong when love is right
Like a man said in his song
Help me make it through the night

Loneliness can get you down
When you get to thinking no one cares

Lean on me (and I'll lean on you)
Together we will see it through

It's sad to think some folks do

No, I don't like to sleep alone
No one does, do you?

I took my love, took it down
I climbed a mountain, and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too

Come and look out through the window
That big old moon is shining down
Tell me now, don't it remind you
Of a blanket on the ground

Remember back when love first found us
We'd go slipping out of town
And we'd love beneath the moonlight
On a blanket on the ground

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walking once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground

Oh, remember how excited
We used to get when love was young
That old moon was our best buddy
We couldn't wait for night to come

Now you know you still excite me
I know you love me like I am
Just once more I wish you'd love me
On the blanket on the ground

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walking once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we our married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground

The rivers turn in their beds
Flowers bloom where she treads
She turns an awful lot of heads
When she comes to town

Miss Grace when you walk by
You're the twinkle in my eye
There's no need to wonder why
I've fallen for you

Ooh ooh ooh Miss Grace

Strangest thing of all you see

Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid-air
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move
Where are the clowns?
Send in the clowns

Just when I'd stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear
And where are the clowns
Send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late in my career
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns
Well, maybe next year

When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer, and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor (Ooh)

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear (sugar bear)

Fly away, high away, bye-bye (Ooh)

A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams

I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive

Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight

He sees her at the same time every night
At the mexican discotheque
She gives him french kisses
He gives her french cigarettes
They sit at the same table every time
The lights are low
But their eyes shine
Just digging the music from those sweet soul bands

She keeps him outta fights
Holds on to his hand
He whispers slowly ""tonight's the night""
Months of planning so it's gotta be right
Under the table her bag is busting at the seams
She made sure to bring everything

Moonlighting
They're leaving everything
Moonlighting
They're losing all their friends
Moonlighting
It's the only way
It's frighening
But it means they'll stay
Together
They're gonna make it together

His blue morris van is parked in an alley
Just by montague street
His friend eddie he did the respray
So he couldn't drive it all last week
And it cost most of the money that he had saved up
To pay eddie's receipt
But he figures it's worth it 'cos the disguise is a must
When they go missing they're gonna look for the van first
She whispers slowly ""it'll be alright""
I took some cash from my building society
And my monthy check came in just right
If only they knew they weren't giving it away

Moonlighting
They're leaving everything
Moonlighting
They're losing all their friends
Moonlighting
It's the only way
It's frighening
But it means they'll stay
Together
They're gonna make it together

9:15 monday morning at the printing works
The boss notices someone's not clocked in
And the water department of the council offices has a message
That mrs. park's daughter is missing
Meanwhile the carlisle turnoff of the m6 motorway
Drinking cold black coffee eating hot cup cakes
She stares at him with his beard unshaved
Wonders at his powers of staying awake
He whispers slowly ""you did just fine""
They shared the driving all through the night
She laughs ""my mother will have lost her mind
We're only ten miles to gretna
They're three hundred behind

Moonlighting
They're leaving everything
Moonlighting
They're losing all their friends
Moonlighting
It's the only way
It's frighening
But it means they'll stay
Together
They're gonna make it together
Moonlighting
They're leaving everything

Moonlighting
They're losing all their friends
Moonlighting
It's the only way
It's frighening
But it means they'll stay
Together
They're gonna make it together

Just gotta tell her anyway

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye

Should have told her that I can't linger
There's a wedding ring on my finger

In the day, we sweat it out on the streets
Of a runaway American dream
At night, we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Yes, girl, we were

Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

[Saxophone Solo]

Beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones
Scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss

(1, 2, 3, 4) The highways jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl, I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go, and we'll walk in the sun
But till then, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

Oh honey, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run
Come on with me, tramps like us
Baby, we were born to run

When the sun shines on the mountain
And the night is on the run
It's a new day
It's a new way
And I fly up to the sun
I can feel the morning sunlight
I can smell the new-mown hay
I can hear God's voice is calling
For my golden sky light way
Una paloma blanca
I'm just a bird in the sky
Una paloma blanca
Over the mountains I fly
No one can take my freedom away
Once I had my share of losing
For they locked me on a chain
Yes they tried to break my power
Oh I still can feel the pain
Una paloma blanca
I'm just a bird in the sky
Una paloma blanca
Over the mountains I fly
No one can take my freedom away

I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, I
I never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says, ""turn around you fool
You know you love him more and more""
Tell me why is it so
Don't want to let you go

Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh baby, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, hey

I never can say goodbye, oh no, I
I never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And that anguish and that doubt
It's that same old dizzy hang-up
I can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
I don't want to let you go

Hey, I never can say goodbye, boy
Ooh baby, I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, ooh

A motor-bike ride in the midday heat
The dust that hung from the desert skies
Run though we'd run it still burned our eyes

Oh yes we may walk on the wild wild side of life
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side
And in the shadows of a promise you can take my hand
And show me a way to understand

So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
Yes if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

Oh oh oh, hmm hmm hmm

A reckless nite in a nameless town
Then we moved out of sight with a silent sound
A beach that wept with deserted waves
That's where we slept knowing we'd be safe
Now you may think you can walk on the wild, wild side with me
But there's a lot I can learn and a lot that I've yet to see
You know you've got my life lying in your hands
It's up to you to make me understand

So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need

Black water keeps rolling on past just the same

And I ain't got no worries cause I ain't in no hurry at all

Well, if it rains, I don't care!
Don't make no difference to me

[Sample]
Do you know what 'nemesis' means?
A righteous infliction of retribution
Manifested by an appropriate agent....
Personified in this case by me

[Verse 1: Aesop Rock]
We're all in the same gang, bread and butter
Just a couple subdivisions who naturally hate each other
Influences shark biting the fuck outta your brother
Friendship is Professor Plum ratting on Colonel Mustard
You are now witnessing the world's most crass version
Of a barnstormer, reveal time with a jagged edge
Arm mortars and field mines for a bastard pledge
On the style diamond cutter
Swung before that magnificent havok sketch
You fidget like a nervous culprit gulping
Sweat a bullet, dead a bullshit sequence reactor
Speaking disaster
Who leaped off the canvas to provoke a side-winding
Snake in the grass with a sturdy belly and his word to sell me
I got my word to tell you
I got absurd magic
For the forks like pistons pumping through the realm my family habits (Is that a rabbit/hat combination)
Nah, more like I spit pixie dust
Till the mixtaper community combusts

[Verse 2: Yeshua Da Poed]
I hold words for ransom
Demand some attention pays
Not to mention praise for their release on a page
It might amaze the light of day
I never said I, gave, them all, the fight to be brave
More insight to behave
Raw like them others
Whose ads have been paid for by some brothers
While some of us lie in the eyes of others
I discovered another way to stay undercover
Kill everyone involved, Unsolve
Mysteries, this to me is how to leave matters resolved
Out of this all, you should take a break as the bait
Get snatched out your habitat and left on the side of alake
I try to debate
Whether a clean getaway is harder to make
Than a call to the cleaners
Dropped off a seamless bag
Zipped it up with enough cash to pay the cat
With the awkward demeanor

[Verse 3: Vast Aire]
God is a name I call myself
I don't like Ugly, Original, Synthetic
I breathe rusty air logic
It becomes the lung, the mind is a closet
That is if it's a walk-in, cuz I'm open
You fell from the clips of weakness, I scoped it
I'll ball your rhyme up and stuff it inside my mouth
As if this was the first grade...(C'mon man)
And you'll just stand there
Your eyes'll water up
And your teeth'll grind cuz you rhyme first grade
Seeing me is like time, I'm a caged poet
But I think life is more than a jail sentence
That's why I, took my time
Doing calisthenics which euphemisms to hand out a life sentence
When I rhyme, I put my ass crack in it
And you in a glass bottom boat with a crack in it
So fuck your attitude
My poetry's position is the sole definition of latitude
Sinister repeated
You tell the angels in heaven you've never seen
An evil so singular personified as you being hit
In the face by the man who killed you

You should have seen me with the poker man
I had a honey and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time, I looked at his hand
I was talking to an Eskimo
Said he was hoping for a fall of snow
When up popped a sea lion ready to go

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's Farm where I want to lay low
Low life, high life, oh, let's go
Take me down to Junior's Farm
Take me down!

At the Houses of Parliament
Everybody's talking about the President
We all chip in for a bag of cement
Ollie Hardy should have had more sense
He bought a gee-gee and he jumped the fence
All for the sake for a couple of pence

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Down to Junior's Farm where I want to lay low

I took my bag to the grocer's store
The price is higher than the time before
Old man asked why is it more
I said you should have seen me with the poker man
I had a honey and I bet a grand
Just in the nick of time, I looked at his hand

I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park

And have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know, tomorrow is their future
But for me just another day

They all gather around me
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain

Well, I know I can't hide from a memory
'Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her?

Anything that she would send

My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you

Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you, dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you

You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by

479,50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,Still Crazy After All These Years,Paul Simon,1975-10-25,217346,67,"

[Verse 1]
""The problem is all inside your head,"" she said to me
""The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover""

She said, ""It's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude""
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

[Chorus 1]
""You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

Ooh, slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free""

[Verse 2]
She said, ""It grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again""
I said ""I appreciate that, and would you please explain
About the 50 ways?""

She said, ""Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light""
And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover

[Chorus 2]
""You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

Slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus

[Verse 1]
I wonder how you're feeling
There's ringing in my ears
And no one to relate to 'cept the sea
Who can I believe in?
I'm kneeling on the floor
There has to be a force
Who do I phone?

But all I really want to know

Oh, won't you show me the way
I want you to show me the way, yeah

You're living on your nerves
When someone drops a cup, and I submerge
I'm swimming in a circle
I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool to play my part

Someone thought of healing
But all I really want to know

Oh, won't you show me the way

Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she wonderful?

I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love?

Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love?

Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one

I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
'Cause you started something, can't you see
That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me?
It happens to be true
I only want to be with you

It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I want to spend each moment of the day with you
Look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you

You stopped, you smiled at me
And askеd me if I cared to dance
I fеll into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance

Now listen, honey
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care

And someone plays the honky tonk guitar
Where all the lights will go out one by one

How many times before the song was ending
Love and understanding, everywhere around

When I will be in Greenville again
Mississippi, you'll be on my mind

Now the country song forever lost it's soul
When the guitar player turns to rock 'n roll
And every time when summer nights are falling
I always will be calling, dreams of yesterday

[Verse 1]
Looking back on when I was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside""
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her
From woopin' your behind

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

[Verse 2]
Brother says he's telling about you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall
(You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing ain't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?

I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came into you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me, a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned

I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind

Stay away
Look out

If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways

Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman

498,Don't give up on us,David Soul,David Soul,1976-01-01,218946,59,"

Don't give up on us, baby
Don't make the wrong seem right
The future isn't just one night
It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know
We can still come through

I really lost my head last night
You've got a right to stop believing
There's still a little love left
Even so

Don't give up on us, baby
Lord knows we've come this far
Can't we stay the way we are?
The angel and the dreamer
Who sometimes plays a fool
Don't give up on us, I know
We can still come through

It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars
We can't change ours

Don't give up on us, baby
We're still worth one more try
I know we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us, I know
We can still come through

Don't give up on us, baby
Don't give up on us, baby

Don't take away the music, it's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock

I knew you were always there
You were my song
How am I supposed to bear it
Now that you've gone

Would you separate the words
Memories from a sweet melody
Baby would you take away
The music from a symphony

Don't take away the music, it's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock
Don't take away the music, everything else is gone
Don't strip my world of this song

Every time you whispered low
My heart would sing
Now it's silent like the phone
The phone that never rings

Memories of love's refrain
Memories keep haunting me
What are we doing to the song we sang
What happened to our sweet harmony

Don't take away the music, it's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock
Don't take away the music, everything else is gone

You run around town like a fool and you think that it's groovy
You're giving it to some other guy
Who gives you the eye
You don't give nothing to me
You painted a smile and you dress all the while to excite me
But don't you know you're turning me on?
I know that it's wrong
But I can't stop the pain inside me

[Chorus]
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do without you?

[Verse 2]
You walk like a dream and you make like you're queen of the action
You're using every trick in the book
The way that you look
You're really something to see
You cheat and you lie to impress any guy that you fancy
(Love really hurts without you)
But don't you know I'm out of my mind
So give me a sign
And help to ease the pain inside me

Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts without you
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?

So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
With a song I just wrote yesterday
And I hope you can hear
What the words and the music have to say

It's so hard to explain
Everything that I'm feelin'
Face to face, I just seem to go dry
But I love you so much
That the sound of your voice can get me high

Thanks for taking me (thanks for taking me)
On a one way trip to the sun (one way trip to the sun)
And thanks for turning me (turning me)
Into a someone (someone)

So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
I brush back the hair from your eyes
And the love on your face
Is so real that it makes me want to cry

And I know that my song isn't saying anything new
Oh, but after the lovin'
I'm still in love with you

And it's sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you

You know how easy it is to hurt me

'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

So you say to yourself, boy
You're out of your brain
Do you think I'm gonna stand here
All night in the rain?
And it's the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
And if you want I'll take you there

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

Ending up just another lost and lonely wife

And they will be filled with tears

Love only breaks up to start over again

A hundred times a day

When you just can't break away

Hung up like my man and me
My man and me

To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

It's high time now, just one crack at life
Who wants to live in trouble and strife
My mind must be free to learn all I can about me, mmm

I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days
Encourage the babies every time they say
Self preservation is what's really going on today

Say I'm gonna turn loose
A thousand times a day

I was lost in France
In the fields the birds were singing
I was lost in France
And the day was just beginning

As I stood there in the morning rain
I had a feeling I can't explain
I was lost in France in love

I was lost in France
In the street a band was playing
And the crowd all danced
Didn't catch what they were saying

When I looked up he was standing there
And I knew I shouldn't but I didn't care
I was lost in France in love

Oooh, lalala, oooh, lalala, dance
Oooh, lalala, dancing
Oooh, lalala, oooh, lalala, dance
Oooh, lalala, dancing

Oooh, lalala, oooh, lalala, dance
Oooh, lalala, dancing

I was lost in France
And the vines were overflowing
I was lost in France
And a million stars were glowing

And I looked round for a telephone
To say: ""Baby, I won't be home""
I was lost in France in love

Guess who just got back today?
Them wild-eyed boys that'd been away
Haven't changed, hadn't much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy

Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot

And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill

And if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favourite song
The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long
Won't be long 'til summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

517,Times Of Your Life,Feelings,Paul Anka,1975,195760,50,"

Good morning yesterday
You wake up and time has slipped away
And suddenly it's hard to find
The memories you left behind
Remember
Do you remember

The laughter and the tears
The shadows of misty yesteryears
The good times and the bad you've seen
And all the others in between
Remember
Do you remember the times of your life (do you remember)

Reach back for the joy and the sorrow
Put them away in your mind
For memories are time that you borrow
To spend when you get to tomorrow

Here comes the setting sun
The seasons are passing one by one
So gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember
Will you remember the times of your life

Gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember
Will you remember the times of your life
Of your life
Of your life

Do you remember, baby
Do you remember the times of your life
Do you remember, baby
Do you remember the times of your life

Make sure that his love is true now

She was only sixteen, only sixteen

It's never struck a chord
With a smile as bright as sunshine

But I'm hiding in the small print
Won't you take another look?
And take me away
Try me, Mandy, fly me away

And her body couldn't be found
Was it in my mind it seems
I had a crazy dream
I told them so but they said no no no no

I found me on a street
And starin' at a wall
If it hadn't have been for Mandy
Her promise up above me
Well I wouldn't be here at all
So if you're travellin' in the sky
Don't be surprised if someone says ""Hi...""

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Buck Dharma]
All our times have come
Here, but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain

[Chorus: Buck Dharma]
(We can be like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2: Buck Dharma]
Valentine is done
Here, but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
Are together in eternity (Romeo and Juliet)
40,000 men and women everyday (Like Romeo and Juliet)
40,000 men and women everyday (Redefine happiness)
Another 40,000 coming everyday

[Chorus: Buck Dharma]
(We can be like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, take my hand
(Don't fear the Reaper) We'll be able to fly
(Don't fear the Reaper) Baby, I'm your man
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3: Buck Dharma]
Love of two is one
Here, but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
The door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew and then disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared

[Alternative Chorus: Buck Dharma]
(Saying, ""don't be afraid"") Come on, baby
(And she had no fear) And she ran to him
(Then she started to fly) They looked backward and said goodbye
(She had become like they are) She had taken his hand
(She had become like they are) Come on, baby
(Don't fear the Reaper)

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Backstroking lover, always hiding 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said, ""You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways.""
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of loving with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing ""Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care.""
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

[Chorus]
""Walk this way, talk this way""
""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, talk this way""
Ah, just give me a kiss
Like this

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing ""Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care.""
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing

Who's gonna water my plants?
Who's gonna patch my pants?
And who's gonna give me
The chance to feel brand new?

Who's gonna iron my shirts?
Who's gonna kiss where it hurts?
And who needs a man when
He flirts the way I do?

Who, if not you?
Who, if not you?

Who, if not you?
Tell me, who, if not you?

Who's gonna wake me on time?
Who'll smile and say I look fine?
And who's gonna stay on my mind
The whole day through?

Who's gonna see that I'm fed?
Then who's gonna want me in bed?
But who'll watch TV instead
Because I do?

Who, if not you?
Tell me, who, if not you?

[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

547,You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim),Foot Loose & Fancy Free,Rod Stewart,1977,270960,51,"

[Verse 1]
I didn't know what day it was
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon
Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical
I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsley prints
I put down to experience
The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were, well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

[Chorus]
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

[Verse 2]
My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance
You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But honey, what do you see in me?

[Chorus]
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

[Verse 3]
You're an essay in glamour
Please pardon the grammar
But you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided
You're the best team, I've ever seen
And there have been, many affairs
Many times I've, thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
Cause you're the warmest thing, I've ever found

[Chorus]
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

To try and please me
You never let me down before, mmm

Lido missed the boat that day he left the shack
But that was all he missed and he ain't comin' back
A tombstone bar in a jukejoint car, he made a stop
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top
Next stop Chi town, Lido put the money down and let it roll

He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road

Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it

Lido be runnin', havin' great big fun, until he got the note
Sayin' toe the line or blow, and that was all she wrote
He be makin' like a beeline, headin' for the borderline
Goin' for broke

Sayin' one more hit ought to do it

I just close my eyes and I'm with you

Payday Friday and the weekend's here
I've been workin' all week tryin' to pay for this gear
Gonna raise hell on Union Street
Thirteen guys and a packet of three
And if I don't get laid I'll sure die tryin'
Tonight this city's gonna be all mine

I want to talk about motorbikes, cars and things
No sophistication or designer jeans
I'm no angel, but I know what I like
A little rough and tumble on a Friday night
I'm like a cornered rat, I gotta explode
Goodbye baby don't know when I'll be home

Tora, Tora, Tora, out with the boys
Tora, Tora, Tora, out with the boys tonight

By eleven o'clock I'll be flyin' high
Ain't nothing in the world that I won't try
Jimmy got smashed, took his trousers off
Barman said, ""You boys have had enough. Join the army, get yourself a decent job.""
Indecent exposure in a parking lot

[Chorus x2]
Bundle on the dance floor, a jaw got bust
Swear to God that it wasn't one of us
A seven foot bouncer called the police
We got pulled in for disturbing the peace
Well if you can't take a joke
Then there ain't no point in living
Sunday morning I woke up laughin'

What d' you say
Tora, Tora, Tora, where's my old man
Tora, Tora, Tora, where's my old man

Slip slidin’ away
Slip slidin’ away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you’re slip slidin’ away

I know a man
He came from my hometown
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said, “Delores, I live in fear
My love for you’s so overpowering
I’m afraid that I will disappear”

Slip slidin’ away
Slip slidin’ away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you’re slip slidin’ away

And, I know a woman
Became a wife
These are the very words she uses to describe her life
She said, “A good day
Ain’t got no rain”
She said, “A bad day’s when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been”

Slip slidin’ away
Slip slidin’ away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you’re slip slidin’ away

And I know a father
Who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons
For the things he’d done
He came a long way
Just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again

Slip slidin’ away
Slip slidin’ away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you’re slip slidin’ away

God only knows
God makes his plan
The information’s unavailable
To the mortal man
We’re working our jobs
Collect our pay
Believe we’re gliding down the highway
When in fact we’re slip slidin’ away

Karanlık bir çöl yolunda

Saçım da soğuk bir rüzgar

Colitaların ılık kokusu

Gökyüzüne yükseliyor

Uzakta bir yerde

Parlak bir ışık gördüm

Kafam ağırlaştı ve görüşüm bulanıklaştı

Gece için durmam gerekti






Orda kapı yolunda duruyordu

Görev zilini duydum

Ve kendi kendime düşündüm

'Bu cennette olabilir, cehennem de'

Sonra kız bir mum yaktı

Ve bana yolu gösterdi

Koridorda sesler vardı

Sanırım şöyle dediklerini duydum






Hotel California'ya hoşgeldiniz

Çok sevimli bir yer (Çok sevimli bir yer)

Çok sevimli bir yüz

Hotel California'da çokça oda var

Senenin herhangi bir zamanı (senenin herhangi bir zamanı)

Burda bulabilirsin






Onun aklı mücеvherlerde

Onun Mеrcedes bends'i var

Arkadaş diye çağırdığı

Bir sürü tatlı erkek arkadaşları var

Sahne de nasıl dans ediyorlar

Tatlı yaz terinde

Bazı danslar hatırlanmak içindir

Bazı danslar unutmak






Kaptana seslendim

""Lütfen bana şarabımı getir""

""Biz de 1969'dan beri o içki yok"" dedi

Ve hala o sesler çok uzaklardan çağırıyor

Seni gecenin ortasında uyandırır

Sadece şunu duyman için






Hotel California'ya hoşgeldiniz

Çok sevimli bir yer (Çok sevimli bir yer)

Çok sevimli bir yüz

Hotel California'da yaşıyorlar

Ne güzel bir süpriz (ne güzel bir süpriz)

Bahanelerinizi getirin






Tavan da aynalar

Buzda büyük pembe şampanya

Ve o dedi ki ""Burada hepimiz sadece kendimizin tutsağız""

Ve ana salonda

Ziyafet için toplandılar

Onu çelik bıçaklarıyla doğradılar

Ama canavarı öldüremezler






Hatırladığım son şey

Kapıya koşutuğumdu

Daha önce olduğum yere giden

Geçidi tekrar bulmalıydım

""Sakinleş"" dedi adam

Varmak için programlandık

""İstediğin zaman çıkış yapabilirsin

Ama asla ayrılamazsın""

It won't be easy
You'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see
Is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen
I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it too

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions
They promise to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do
Is look at me to know
That every word is true

All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

I'd like to stay in love with you
All summer and after fall
I'll keep you warm through the winter
Because I've noticed one thing
This ain't no summer fling

I'd like to ride my bicycle with you
On the handlebars
You'd laugh and run away
As I'd chase you through the meadow

Without you I'd die
Let's never say good-bye

[Chorus]
Oh, Lori
You bring the spring, the summer, fall
Ooo and winter
By the season
Oh, Lori (oh, Lori)
You make me feel as though I've been born again
Born again

You danced for me in your bare feet
That mellow afternoon
When we made love to each other
And I'm loving you
That's all I want to do

Looking just the same as you did last time I touched you

Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you

Do you love him
As much as I love her?
And will that love be strong
When old feelings start to stir?

Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

Love's so strange
Playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting
And we're the fools
Standing close enough to touch those burning memories

And if I hold you
For the sake of all those times
Love made us lose our minds
Could I ever let you go?

But love had just begun

I can't refuse her
But now I know that I'm the fool
Who won your love to lose it all

And I'm not proud to say
I let love slip away

When will my heartache end?
Will my whole life depend on fading memories

So you win again, you win again

[Verse 1:]
In a bar in Toledo
Across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name

When the drinks finally hit her
She said I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings

In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face

The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking
His big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

[Chorus:]
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

[Verse 2:]
After he left us
I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talkin' at all

She was a beauty
But when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her
'Cuz the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

[Repeat Chorus:]
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

583,Night Moves,Night Moves,Bob Seger,1976-10-22,324422,70,"

[Intro]
I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly renown
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own, sitting way up high

[Chorus]
Way up firm and high
Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on our night moves
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves in the summertime
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love oh no far from it
We weren't searchin’ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods
I used her she used me
But neither one cared
We were getting our share

Workin' on our night moves
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
And it was summertime
Mhm, sweet summer time, summer time

[Bridge]
And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in

[Outro]
Night Moves
Night moves (night moves)
Night moves (night moves)
Yeah, Remember, night moves
Sure do remember those night moves (night moves)
Ain't it funny how you remember (night moves)
Funny how you remember the night moves
I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember night whoa, whoa
It's works, working and practicing
Oh, on the night moves
Working and practicing....

584,Lost Without Your Love,Lost Without Your Love,Bread,1977,176893,54,"

Lost and all alone
I always thought
That I could make it on my own

Since you left
I hardly make it through the day
My tears get in the way
And I need you back to stay

I wander through the night
And search the world to find
The words to make it right

All I want is just
The way it used to be
With you here close to me
I've got to make you see

That I'm lost without your love
Life without you
Isn't worth the trouble of

I'm as helpless
As a ship without a wheel
A touch without a feel
I can't believe it's real

And someday soon
I'll wake
And find my heart
Won't have to break

Yes, I'm lost without your love
Life without you isn't
Worth the trouble of

All I want is just
The way it used to be
I need you here with me

Oh, darling
Can't you see?
If we had love before
We can have it back once more

586,Love's Unkind,I Remember Yesterday,Donna Summer,1977-05-13,266066,42,"

Well, I see him every morning
In the schoolyard when the school bell rings
And when he passes in the hallway
Well, he doesn't seem to notice me
He's got a crush on my best friend
But she don't care
'Cause she loves someone else
I'm standing on the outside
Not the inside where I wanna be

Chorus:
Love's unkind
Love's unkind
Love's unkind
Love's unkind

'Cause he's not mine

Just the other day
I was praying he would give me a chance
Hoping he would choose me
For his partner for the high school dance
I was standing outside the class
But it wasn't me
But my best friend he asked
I went running back inside
Teary-eyed and left the two of them behind

Chorus

'Cause he's not mine

Oh, I love him so
But I can't even let him know
'Cause he loves my best friend
But she don't care
She loves someone else
And I asked my mama
And she said: ""Love's unkind
Love's so unkind""
She said: ""Just keep it in mind
'Cause you may find
Love's unkind""

Chorus

Why has love to be so?
Why do I have to love him so?

Just a song before I go
To whom it may concern
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burned

[Verse 1]
When the shows were over
We had to get back home
And when we opened up the door
I had to be alone

[Verse 2]
She helped me with my suitcase
She stands before my eyes
Driving me to the airport
And to the friendly skies

[Verse 3]
Going through security
I held her for so long
She finally looked at me in love
And she was gone

Just a song before I go
A lesson to be learned
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burned

Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious

Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love

Isn't she pretty
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed

I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love

Isn't she lovely
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name

Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love

Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forevermore

Disappointment was my closest friend
But you came, he soon departed
And he never showed his face again

Ohh I'm so glad I finally found you
You're that one in a million man
When you wrap your lovin' arms around me
I can stand up and face the world again

Your love is liftin' me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it up, quench my desire
And I'll be at your side forevermore

After everything I put you through

The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone

Seedy motels and no star hotels still I had to learn
That the one shining thing in my mind
Was the sweet love I had with you
And honey you're my last hope
And who else can I turn to

Come on Silver Lady take my word

You asked me not to call you on the phone
Well there's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of a song

Now the glamour of the gay night-life has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Well you went to be somebody else's baby
And forget the truest love you've ever known

I never knew there were honky-tonk angels
Oh I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one who ever loved you
And went back to that wild side of life

[Verse 1]
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

[Verse 2]
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
Cause I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more
(Did you know that you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

[Bridge]
We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now ain't that loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Ain't that loving you?)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream-Um (Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left

I'm sailing away
Set an open course for the Virgin Sea
'Cause I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me

On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow on every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try to carry on

[Verse 2]
I look to the sea
Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends, and the dreams we had

We lived happily forever, so the story goes
But somehow we missed out on the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can, to carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope, and this is what they said

They said: Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me, babe
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
Hello, my love, I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain I gaze, the sun doesn't shine
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind
In the garden, I see, west purple shower bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music, I hear, so happy and loud
Blue flowers echo from a cherry cloud

[Bridge]
Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
If you tried to ask, ""Or is it cool?"" (Is it cool?)
If you arrive and don't see me
I'm gonna be with my baby
I'm free, flyin' in her arms
Over the sea

[Verse 2]
Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kites
With velvet roses digging freedom flight

[Chorus]
A present from you
Strawberry letter twenty-two
The music plays, I sit in for a few

[Chorus]
A present from you
Strawberry letter twenty-two
The music plays, I sit in for a few

Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

[Verse 2]
Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

[Verse 3]
Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old

[Verse 4]
Old man
He and his dog, they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy

[Verse 5]
Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the Southern skies

Hello, girl, it's been a while
Guess you'll be glad to know
That I've learned how to laugh and smile
Getting over you was slow
They say old lovers can be good friends
But I never thought I'd really see you
I'd really see you again

[Chorus]
I go crazy
When I look in your eyes, I still go crazy
No, my heart just can't hide
That old feelin' inside
Way deep down inside
Oh, baby
You know when I look in your eyes I go crazy

You say he satisfies your mind
Tells you all of his dreams
I know how much that means to you
I realize that I was blind
Just when I thought I was over you
I see your face and it just ain't true
No, it just ain't true

When I look in your eyes, I still go crazy
That old flame comes alive
It starts burning inside
Way deep down inside

Lived a young shepherd boy, Angelo
Who met a young girl and he loved her so

Rich was she
Came from a very high family
Angelo knew it could never be
They ran away to their destiny

Running away together, running away forever
Angelo
Running away from danger, hiding from every stranger
Angelo

They knew it wasn't wrong, they found a love so strong
They took their lives at night and in the morning light
They found them on the sand, they saw them lying there

What do you do with a B.A. in English?
What is my life going to be?
Four years of college
And plenty of knowledge
Have earned me this useless degree!
I can't pay the bills yet
'Cause I have no skills yet
The world is a big scary place!
But somehow I can't shake
The feeling I might make
A difference to the human race!

You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear the music ring

[Verse 2]
Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

[Verse 3]
Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

[Verse 4]
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

[Verse 5]
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole

And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home""
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
""We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes

Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light

Angry aggressive, always stay mad at me

Them niggas challenged them so had to retaliate
I have his back so I picked up his slack for him
Though got to heavy now they call me masculine
Oh you gay, you must have been raped
Anything you can do I can too
You can’t get [?] thinking logical
No way that is not possible
Get out of line, I slapped the snot out of you
Give up the drugs, you’re a thot or a prostitute
Constantly doubting you
Lack of confidence from doubting you
You’re valuable girl, I’m so proud of you
You’re still smiling like the sky’s the bluest
Disguise and bruises, don’t know how you do it
Going through it, girl you got Adonis
You’re the truest, has more to offer than just making babies
Told to sit down and then act like a lady
Stay in your place, where is that exactly
Not in the kitchen cooking cleaning the dishes
So early not over your knee
Watch the way that you’re talking to me
Damn it all these double standards
Praise the man against the panics
No strings attached
Pump that pussy then that Plan B

Sold her dreams
Offered her everything except a wedding ring
Planted seeds without watering
She never really blossomed fully, she was 17
Lies and infidelity
No promises, no expectancy

He was absent the whole pregnancy
Re-routed her destiny
She was on the right path
That post-partum hit her hard with the right jab
Stopped answering the calls, doesn’t write back
He was only interested in [?]
You know, a little nightcap
Oh I hurt you girl, my bad, I thought you like that
She just wants her life back
This is what happens when you bring her down, you take the crown
She’s taking downers, over counter, got her guard up
Out here wildin’, acting childish, bashing cars in
Can’t you see that she's scarred
She’s been enduring with a broken heart, my god
There is so much damage, you’re so demanding
Brought her closer then left her stranded
No closure, it’s open-ended
Co-dependent, incoherent, can’t compare it, loose cannon
Can hardly manage, feeling famished
Wishing she could vanish
Trying not to panic
Got to get established
Too late in the game
Still gonna take a stab at it
And desperately for change
I desire better for myself
That requires for me to start asking for some help
Taking baby steps, trying to do my best
Been tested, more than the rest, life ain’t fair, but I’m not upset
Reminded every day, I cannot forget
[?] and conquered out of shit

Hold on tight, you got it
We will not be quiet

You don’t want no problems now

All my fears are drifting by me so slowly now
Fading away

I can say
The night is long but you are here
Close at hand, oh I'm better for the smile you give
And while I live

I will follow you, will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year there will be

I will follow you, will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year
I will follow you, will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year
I will follow you, will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year

631,My Life,52nd Street,Billy Joel,1978-10-13,284000,69,"

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Got a call from an old friend, we used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A

[Chorus]
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

[Post-Chorus]
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
(I never said you had to...)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(I never said...)

[Refrain]
I still belong (Still belong)
Don't get me wrong (Get me wrong)
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time

[Verse 2]
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
Ah, but sooner or later, you sleep in your own space
Either way, it's okay, you wake up with yourself

[Chorus]
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

[Post-Chorus]
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
(I never said you had to...)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(Of circumstance...)

[Refrain]
I still belong (Still belong)
Don't get me wrong (Get me wrong)
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time

[Chorus]
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

[Outro]
Keep it to yourself, it's my life
Keep it to yourself, it's my life
Keep it to yourself, it's my life
Keep it to yourself, it's my life...

633,On Broadway,The George Benson Collection,George Benson,1981,316160,55,"

They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
But when you're walking down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you right on Broadway
But looking at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how you gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes

They say I won't last too long on Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say
But they're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this guitar
And I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway

I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway
No, no, no, no
I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway

Do do do do

A dying flame
You're free again
Who could love
And do that to you?

All dressed in black
He won't be coming back
Well, save your tears
You've got years and years

The pains of seventeens
Unreal, they're only dreams
Save your crying for the day

Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why

New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun

Miss Teenage Dream
Such a tragic scene
He knocked your crown
And ran away

First wound of pride
And how you cried and cried
But save your tears
You've got years and years

Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why

New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun

(Fool if you think it's over)
(Fool if you think it's over)

I'll buy your first good wine
We'll have a real good time
Save your crying for the day

That may not come
But anyone
Who had to pay
Would laugh at you and say

Fool if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool if you think it's over
I'll tell you why

New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun

I'll buy your first good wine
Oooh, we'll have a real good time
Save your crying for the day

New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
You're a fool if you think it's over
It's just begun

Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
I love you

You shared my dreams, my joys, my pains
You made my life worth living for
And if I had to live my life over again, dear
I'd spend each and every moment with you

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
I love you

When we are together, the moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you, to hold you, to feel you, to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart

You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you

Take me now, baby, here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes

Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust

I feel so bad I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou

[Pre-Chorus]
Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou

Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

[Verse 2]
Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickels saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times

I'm going back someday
Come what may

By my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh some sweet day
Gonna take away
This hurting inside

639,You Needed Me,Let's Keep It That Way,Anne Murray,1978,220266,61,"

I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me
You needed me, you needed me

640,Baker Street,City to City,Gerry Rafferty,1978,365626,68,"

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Windin' your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town
And forget about everything

[Pre-Chorus]
But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin'
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone
And when you wake up, it's a new mornin'
The sun is shinin', it's a new mornin'
You're goin', you're goin' home

You know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see, I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you

[Verse]
You came along just like a song
And brightened my day
Who'd have believed that you were part of a dream?
Now it all seems light-years away

[Chorus]
And now you know I can't smile without you (No I can't smile without you)
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing

You see, I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile

Now some people say happiness takes so very long to find
Well, I'm finding it hard leaving your love behind me

And you see I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see I feel glad when you're glad

If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you

642,Still The Same,Stranger In Town,Bob Seger,1978-05-05,203546,63,"

[Verse 1]
You always won every time you placed a bet
You're still damn good, no one's gotten to you yet
Every time they were sure they had you caught
You were quicker than they thought
You'd just turn your back and walk

[Verse 2]
You always said the cards would never do you wrong
The trick, you said, was never play the game too long
A gambler's share, the only risk that you would take
The only loss you could forsake
The only bluff you couldn't fake

[Verse 3]
And you're still the same, I caught up with you yesterday
(Still the same, you're still the same)
Moving game to game, with no one standing in your way
Turning on the charm, long enough to get you by
(Still the same, you're still the same)
You're still the same
You still aim high

[Bridge]
There you stood, everybody watched you play
I just turned and walked away
I had nothing left to say (ooo)

[Outro]
'Cause you're still the same (still the same)
(Baby, babe, you're still the same)
You're still the same (still the same)
(Baby, babe, you're still the same)

(Baby, babe, you're still the same)
Some things never change (still the same)
(Baby, babe, you're still the same)
Oh, you're still the same (still the same)

643,Sometimes When We Touch,Longer Fuse,Dan Hill,1977-07-05,252707,61,"

[Verse 1]
You ask me if I love you, and I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly, than mislead you with a lie

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And who am I to judge you, on what you say or do?
I'm only just beginning, to see the real you

[Chorus]
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes, and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you, 'til the fear in me subsides

[Verse 2]
Romance and all its strategy, leaves me battling with my pride
But through the insecurity, some tenderness survives

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm just another writer, still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter, still trapped within my youth

[Chorus]
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you, 'til the fear in me subsides

[Bridge]
At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly

[Verse 3]
At times I understand you, and I know how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you, and I've watched love pass you by

[Pre-Chorus 3]
At times I think we're drifters, still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister, but then the passion flares again

[Chorus]
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you 'til I die
'Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you, 'til the fear in me subsides

644,(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away,Shadow Dancing,Andy Gibb,1978-01-01,250200,53,"

Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why
But lately you don't talk to me
Darling I can't see me in your eyes
I hold you near but you're so far away
And it's losing you I can't believe
To watch you leave and let this feeling die

You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
And tomorrow if I'm here without your love
You know I can't survive
Only my love can raise you high above it all

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

We can take the darkness and make if full of light
But let your love flow back to me
How can you leave and let this feeling die
This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on
No other woman's love could be as true, I'm begging you

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

We changed the world we made it ours to hold
But dreams are made for those who really try
This losing you is real
But I still feel you here inside

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love
Don't throw it all away, our love

I close my eyes, only for a moment
And the moment's gone
All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity

[Chorus]
Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

[Verse 2]
Same old song, just a drop of water
In an endless sea
All we do crumbles to the ground
Though we refuse to see

[Chorus]
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind

[Bridge]
Oh, ho, ho

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy

Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind

Dust in the wind

Whenever I call you friend
I begin to think I understand
Anything we are
You and I have always been ever and ever

I see myself within your eyes
And that's all I need to show me why
Everything I do, always takes me home to you
Ever and ever

Now I know my life has given me
More than memories
Day by day we can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
Sweet love flowin' almost every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it...right

Whenever I call you friend
I believe I've come to understand
Everywhere we are you and I were meant to be
Forever and ever

I think about the times to come
Knowin' I will be the lucky one
Ever our love will last
I always want to call you friend

Sweet love...sweet love
You're the glowing light in my life
The source of pride in my life
Everything I do takes me back to you

Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

[Verse 1]
Baby, we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here

[Verse 2]
I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm cryin' icicles instead of tears
And all I can do is keep on tellin' you

[Chorus]
I want you, I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad, (Don't be sad cause)
Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad, (Cause)
Cause two out of three ain't bad

You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're lookin' for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coupe de Ville hidin'
At the bottom of a Cracker Jack box

I can't lie, I can't tell you that I'm somethin' I'm not
No matter how I try, I'll never be able
To give you somethin', somethin' that I just haven't got

[Verse 3]
Well, there's only one girl that I will ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back, ooh I know
Well, I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Oh, she kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away
And she kept on tellin' me
She kept on tellin' me
She kept on tellin' me

[Chorus]
I want you, oh, I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad, cause two out of three ain't bad

I want you, I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad, cause two out of three ain't bad

[Verse 1]
Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair
And a dress cut down to there
She would merengue and do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
Tony always tended bar

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Across the crowded floor
They worked from eight 'til four
They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for more?

[Chorus]
At the Copa, Copacabana (Copa, Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (Here)
At the Copa, Copacabana (Copacabana)
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the Copa, they fell in love
(Copa, Copacabana)

[Verse 2]
His name was Rico, he wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair
He saw Lola dancing there
And when she finished, he called her over
But Rico went a bit too far
Tony sailed across the bar

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And then the punches flew
And chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gunshot
But just who shot who?

At the Copa, Copacabana (Copa, Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (Here)
At the Copa, Copacabana (Copacabana)

At the Copa, she lost her love

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl
But that was thirty years ago
When they used to have a show
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola
Still in the dress she used to wear
Faded feathers in her hair

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She sits there so refined
And drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind

[Chorus]
At the Copa, Copacabana (Copa, Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (Here)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields
In '65, I was seventeen and running up 101
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on

[Chorus]
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

[Verse 2]
Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In '69, I was twenty-one and I called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on

[Chorus]
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

[Bridge]
Everyone I know, everywhere I go
People need some reason to believe
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave

[Verse 3]
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them running too

[Chorus]
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind
Running on, running into the sun
But I'm running behind

[Verse 4]
Honey, you really tempt me
You know the way you look so kind
I'd love to stick around but I'm running behind
(Running on)
You know I don't even know what I'm hoping to find
(Running blind)
Running into the sun but I'm running behind

Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end

[Verse 1]
You got me looking at that heaven in your eyes
I was chasing your direction, I was telling you no lies
And I was loving you
When the words are said, baby, I lose my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And in a world of people, there's only you and I
There ain't nothing come between us in the end
How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you

[Chorus]
Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right, uh-huh
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

[Verse 2]
All that I need is just one moment in your arms
I was chasing your affection, I was doing you no harm
And I was loving you
Make it shine, make it rain, baby I know my way

[Pre-Chorus]
I need that sweet sensation of living in your love
I can't breathe when you're away, it pulls me down
You are the question and the answer am I
Only you can see me through
I leave it up to you

[Chorus]
Do it light, taking me through the night
Shadow dancing, baby you do it right
Give me more, drag me across the floor
Shadow dancing, all this and nothing more

Sugar, sugar, oh

[Verse 1]
She sits alone waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking

[Chorus]
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so
Tell me so baby

[Verse 2]
He's acting shy looking for an answer
Come on honey let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

[Chorus]
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on honey tell me so
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know

[Bridge]
His heart's beating like a drum
'cos at last he's got this girl home
Relax baby now we are all alone

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
They wake at dawn 'cos all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other neither one's complaining
He says I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind sugar we can watch the early movie

[Chorus]
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so

[IInstrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know
If you really, really, really, really need me
Just let me know
Just reach out and touch me
If you really want me

Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me

If you, if you, if you really need me
Just come on and tell me so

Let the street have their way

And it looks like it's gonna be
Another sleepless night
I've been listening to your dreams
And getting very low
Wondering what I can do

Maybe I'm being foolish
'Cause I haven't heard you mention
Anybody's name at all
How I wish I could be sure
It's me that turns you on
Each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie

You've been talking in your sleep
Sleeping in your dreams
With some sweet lover
Holding on so tight
Loving her the way
You used to love me
Talking in your sleep
With loving on your mind

And you'll be sorry you crossed me

Sinkin' piña colada

And wallow in a dreadlock holiday

Doing anything just to get you off of my mind

And tryin' to forget you is just a waste of time

Trying to keep up a smile that hides a tear

Is that why...You're.. angry?

Maybe a little
Not even maybe
Must be the weather
Now don't be a baby
We'll how am I supposed to feel with all the things you don't reveal and you can thank your lucky stars that we're not as smart as we'd like to think we are

Would you like to talk about it?
There's not much to say
We had lunch this afternoon. Her life's in disarray
She still goes around as if she is always stumbling off a cliff
Do you still want her?
What are you saying?

Baby stop playing
Really, I mean it. Can you forget her?
Baby, now stop it. You should know better
I know this is hard to do. But, there's no one for me but you and

Do you still love me?
Yes, I still love you
You mean, you're not just being nice
No, I'm not just being nice
Do you feel sleepy
Aw, you're so sincere. Yes, I feel sleepy
Well, slide over here. 'Cause I may not be all that bright, but I know how to hold you tight and

Me and my radio truckin' on through the night
3-5-7-9 on a double white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light

Whiz kid sitting pretty on your two-wheel stallion
This ol' ten-ton lorry got a bead on you
Ain't no use setting up with a bad companion
Ain't nobody get the better of you-know-who

2-4-6-8, ain't never too late
Me and my radio truckin' on through the night
3-5-7-9 on a double white line
That same old motorway sun coming up with the morning light

Well, there ain't no route you could choose to lose the two of us
Ain't nobody know when you're acting right or wrong
No one knows if a roadway's leading nowhere
Gonna keep on driving home on the road I'm on

And it's 2-4-6-8, ain't never too late
Just me and my radio truckin' on through the night

[Verse 1]
She said, can you sit and keep him company
I gotta work and it hurts to see him grieving, nothing’s comforting
The door close, I lay there, blank stare, gazing through my own thoughts
Wishing I could doze off, cause how I’m feeling
Hard to put into words
Embarrassed or ashamed
Felt alone in all my pain
Kinda hard to be explained how I’m sick of myself
Why the fuck she even love me, all I think to myself
Why she still care, still here after I blamed her
For all my problems
Had the nerve to say I forgave her
For not being who I thought I wanted
Haunted by my fantasies
Reality I’m tender-hearted, slipping out of sanity
You ever feel broken at the end of your rope
Feel betrayed by the different ways you used to cope
My strengths turned to weakness, my demons are my secrets
I don’t want to tell, fuck I look like needing help
My shoulder’s bad, the burden, that’s a blessing turned cursed
Took a stillborn to see my own rebirth
I wouldn’t know that til later now I’m mention the [?]
Gripped a fifth and (ayoo, yo, are you good bro?)

[Chorus]
You might want to check on your strong friend
Seeing if they strong in the long end
Might see if they struggling
If they need love and a helping hand

[?] the roadmap up to my soul, you’re the [?]

[Verse 2]
I’m on the bridge, on the ledge with the gun holding
With them pills, slit the wrist, with the noose folding
Got the smiles got the jokes but inside crying
Staying high, staying big, yet inside dying
Isolated in a crowd of people
Voices in my head speaking pure evil
If I start to speak they talking medication
I need a vacation, twist up with meditation
What’s wrong with me?
Thought I was stronger now I’m feeling weak
Ain’t really here, can’t really eat
Never used words like depressed or stressed
It was either you was living or you facing death
Answer my ghost and heal the hurt lurking
Central nervous system tapped and it ain’t working
Resilience in the face of odds
The complexity of sorrow got me praising God
My weaponized skin tone got me unarmed
My unanswered prayers kept me unharmed
Through a circle, never landed on an angle
Tried to jump, I got caught up in a tangle

[?] you took my people, oh
Used my skin, my skin
To try [?]
In another sequel

[Chorus]
You might want to check on your strong friend
Seeing if they strong in the long end
Might see if they struggling
If they need love and a helping hand

Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me

They told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering

On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you

Sometimes when we make love I still can see your face
Just try to recall when we were as one

[Intro]

She stood there bright as the sun on that California coast
He was a Midwestern boy on his own
She looked at him with those soft eyes, so innocent and blue
He knew right then he was too far from home
He was too far from home

She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach
They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles up those twisting, turning roads
Higher and higher and higher they climbed

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills

[Bridge]

He'd headed west cause he felt that a change would do him good
See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face that would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
He had lost all control

Night after night, day after day, it went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights of LA
Wondering if he could ever go home

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
It was looking so right
It was giving him chills
In those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
With a passion that kills

In those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills

In those Hollywood nights

Until one day when the sky turned dark

Caught by the rain and blinded by the lightning

Until the storm passed
And we fell down laughing in the wet grass
Both our bodies drying in the sunshine
Sweet sunshine

Now every mile away and every day
Cuts a little bit deeper

I'd like to take her out of her chains

But when my eyes looked at her I learned
That she was keeping a secret fire
And if I got real close I'd burn

So it looked like I had to move slowly
Just like a cat at night in the trees
'Cause I was waiting for her to show me
That way that she liked her love to feel

After you go, I'll stay out all night long if I feel like it

Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on a beach

Summer night city
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

[Verse 1: Agentha & Frida]
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong

[Pre-Chorus 1: Björn and Agentha, Björn, Benny & Frida]
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free

[Chorus 1: Agentha, Björn, Benny & Frida]
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live

Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

It's elusive call it glitter
Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone

[Pre-Chorus 2: Björn and Agentha, Björn, Benny & Frida]
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere

[Chorus 2: Agentha, Björn, Benny & Frida]
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach

695,Rat Trap,A Tonic For The Troops,The Boomtown Rats,1978,310773,44,"

[Verse 1]
There was a lot of rocking going on that night
Cruising time for the young bright lights
Just down past the gasworks by the meat factory door
The Five Lamp boys were coming on strong
The Saturday night city beat had already started
And the pulse of the corner boys just sprang into action
And young Billy watched it under the yellow street light
And said ""Tonight of all nights, there's gonna be a fight""

[Verse 2]
Billy don't like it living here in this town
He says the traps have been sprung long before he was born
He says ""Hope bites the dust behind all the closed doors
And pus and grime ooze from its scab crusted sores""
There's screaming and crying in the high rise blocks""
It's a rat trap, Billy, but you're already caught
But you can make it if you want to or you need it bad enough
You're young and good looking and you're acting kind of tough

[Chorus 1]
Anyway, it's Saturday night time to see what's going down
Put on the bright suit, Billy, head for the right side of town
It's only 8 o'clock but you're already bored
You don't know what it is but there's got to be more
You'd better find a way out, hey, kick down that door
It's a rat trap and you've been caught

[Bridge]
""In this town,"" Billy says ""Everybody tries to tell you what to do""
""In this town,"" Billy says ""Everybody says you gotta follow rules""
You walk up to those traffic lights, switch from your left to your right
You push in that button and that button comes alight
It tells you ""Walk don't walk, walk don't walk
""Talk don't talk, talk don't talk""
""Walk don't walk, walk don't walk
""Talk don't talk, talk don't talk""
Hey, Billy, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Hey, Billy, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Hey, Billy, take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Hey, Billy, take a walk with me

[Verse 3]
Oh, little Judy's trying to watch Top of the Pops
But Mum and Dad are fighting, don't they ever stop?
She take down her coat and walks out on the street
It's cold on that road, but it's got that home beat
Deep down in her pocket, she finds 50p
Now is that any way for a young girl to be?
""I'm gonna get out of school, work in some factory
Work all the hours God gave me, get myself a little easy money""
Now, now, now

[Chorus 2]
Her mind's made up, she walks down the road
Her hands in her pockets, coat buttoned 'gainst the cold
She finally finds Billy down at the Italian cafe
And when he's drunk, it's hard to understand what Billy says
But then he mumbles in his coffee and he suddenly roars
""It's a rat trap, Judy! And we've been caught.""

[Outro]
Rat trap, you've been caught in a
Rat trap, you've been caught in a
Rat trap, you've been caught in a
Rat trap, you've been caught in a
Rat trap, you've been caught in a
Rat trap, you've been caught in a
Rat trap, you've been caught in a
Rat trap, you've been caught in a
Rat trap, you've been caught in a

Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain against my window

Hey window pane do you remember?
How sweet it used to be

Everything was so grand, yes it was
Now that we've parted

Alone with the pillow
Where his head used to lay, yeah

And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

At first I was afraid I was petrified
Thinking I couldn't live without you by my side
And I've been spending nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And now you're back
From outer space
And I find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
Oh made you leave your key
If I've known for a second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And all my love to give and I'll survive
I, I, I will survive
It took all my strength not to fall apart
Trying' without my mind to mend my broken heart
I spent so many nights
Feeling sorry for myself, how I cried
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that lonely little person who's still in love with you
Now you come dropping in
Expecting me to be free
Now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me
Go on now, walk out the door
Turn around now

Think I'd might crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
No, not I, I will survive

I've got my life to live
And all my love to give and I'll survive

Go and go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And all my love to give and I'll survive
I, I, I will survive
It took all my strength not to fall apart
Trying' without my mind to mend my broken heart
I spent so many nights
Feeling sorry for myself, how I cried
Now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
Not that lonely little person who's still in love with you
Now you come dropping in
Expecting me to be free
But I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me
Go on and go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Think I'd might crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
No, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got my life to live
And all my love to give and I'll survive
I, I, I will survive
Go on and go, walk out the door
Turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye

[Verse 1]
You're so hot, teasing me
So you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl, you're only a child

[Chorus]
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

[Post-Chorus]
Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

[Verse 2]
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile
Smile, but girl, you're only a child

[Chorus]
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl

He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

[Pre-Chorus]
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

[Chorus]
But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return

[Pre-Chorus]
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

When I walked you home, kiss goodnight

Full of open hearts, turned to stone
All together, all alone

Lit the strobe light up the wall

Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears

Until i find an open door
Off the street or onto the floor

Floating out on the tide
Following the river of death downstream

A strange glow in the sky
And nobody seems to know where it goes
And what does it mean?
Oh, is it a dream?

Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes

Is it a kind of a shadow?
Reaching into the night
Wandering over the hills unseen
Or, is it a dream?

There's a high wind in the trees
A cold sound in the air
And nobody ever knows when you go
And where do you start?
Oh, into the dark

Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?

You packed in the morning, I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way

But I miss you more than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
Left me just when I needed you most

Now most every morning, I stare out the window
And I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me

'Cause I need you more than I needed before
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
Left me just when I needed you most

[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 1]
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""

[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

Playing a part in a picture show

Oh, all the greenery is comin' down, boy
And then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture
Oh, it's peculiar, she used to be so nice
When lonely days turn to lonely nights
You take a trip to the city lights
And take the long way home
Take the long way home
You never see what you want to see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home
Take the long way home
And when you're up on the stage, it's so unbelievable
Oh, unforgettable, how they adore you
But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity
Oh, calamity, is there no way out?
Oh, yeah

Does it feel that you life's become a catastrophe?
Oh, it has to be for you to grow, boy

And see what you could have been
Oh, what might have been
If you'd had more time
So, when the day comes to settle down
Who's to blame if you're not around?

[Verse 1]
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

[Verse 2]
He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

[Verse 3]
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

[Chorus]
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

[Verse 4]
Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

[Verse 5]
And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

[Chorus]
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)

739,Escape (The Pina Colada Song),Partners In Crime,Rupert Holmes,1979-01-01,276493,73,"

[Verse 1]
I was tired of my lady
We'd been together too long
Like a worn out recording
Of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read:

[Hook]
""If you like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape""

[Verse 2]
I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad:

[Hook]
""Yes, I like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape""

[Verse 3]
So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said, ""Aw, it's you""
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said, ""I never knew""

[Hook]
That you like piña coladas
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape

[Hook]
If you like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape

[Hook]
Yes I like piña coladas
And getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
Where we'll plan our escape

Oh, I could write you paragraphs

I get the same old dreams, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up

[Pre-Chorus]
These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in

[Chorus]
Since you been gone, since you been gone
I'm out of my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
You cast the spell so break it
Oh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Since you been gone

[Verse 2]
So in the night, I stand, beneath the back street light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon
The night-time comes around too soon
You can't know what you mean to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn

[Chorus]
Since you been gone, since you been gone

[Verse 1]
For awhile, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
In our eyes, we're alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night, something right
Would invite us to begin the day

[Pre-Chorus]
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

[Chorus]
And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

[Verse 2]
For awhile, to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Oh, baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
'Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love in two

Something happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
Oh, and yesterday was all we had

And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Well, someone told me yesterday
That when you throw your love away

And sit and nurse my broken heart

Spring was never waiting for us, dear
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
Birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing
Chinese checkers by the trees

MacArthur Park's is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again

Need your touch

[Verse 1]
Lady, morning's just a moment away
And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me
You said you never needed me
I wonder if you need me now

[Chorus]
We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
Remembering the pain if I must say
It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all
I do love you
Still

[Verse 2]
Those memories
Times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can't put aside
For what we had
Sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind
So many dreams that flow away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm
Where did we go?
Where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all
I do love You
Still

[Chorus]
We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
'Cause I needed you so desperately!
We were too blind to see
But then most of all
I do love You
Still

Some girls will, some girls won't
Some girls need a lot of lovin' and some girls don't
Well, I know I've got the fever but I don't know why
Some say they will and some girls lie

So here I am in front of you
Not really knowing what to do
My heart is feeling something new
Nervously I turn away from you

I see the looks you're sending me
Is this the way it's meant to be?
It's something we should talk about
Just give me time to work it out

Some girls will, some girls won't
Some girls need a lot of lovin' and some girls don't
Well, I know I've got the fever but I don't know why
Some say they will and some girls lie

I find your company to be
Something completely new to me
Now that I know you socially
Obviously I'll fall heavily

I've seen those looks you're sending me
This is the way it's meant to be
There's nothing left to talk about
Oh, how I wish you'd work it out

Some girls will, some girls won't
Some girls need a lot of lovin' and some girls don't
Well, I know I've got the fever but I don't know why
Some say they will and some girls lie

Have you heard about the Lonesome Loser?
Beaten by the Queen of Hearts every time
Have you heard about the Lonesome Loser?
He's a loser but he still keeps on trying

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody?
Someday somebody's gonna see inside
You have to face up, you can't run and hide

Have you heard about the Lonesome Loser?
Beaten by the Queen of Hearts every time
Have you heard about the Lonesome Loser?
He's a loser but he still keeps on trying

Unlucky at love at least that's what they say
He lost his head and he gambled his heart away
He still keeps searching though there's nothing left
Staked his heart and lost, now he has to pay the cost

Have you heard about the Lonesome Loser?
Beaten by the Queen of Hearts every time
Have you heard about the Lonesome Loser?
He's a loser but he still keeps on trying

""It's okay."" he smiles and says
But this loneliness is driving him crazy
He don't show what goes on in his head
But if you watch very close you'll see it all

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody?
Someday somebody's gonna see inside
You have to face up, you can't run and hide

Have you heard about the Lonesome Loser?
Now tell me have you heard about the Lonesome Loser?

Night comes down and finds you alone
In a space and time of your own
Lost in dreams in a world full of shadows

Down the street the neon light shines
Offering refuge and hope to the blind
You stumble in with no thought of tomorrow

Yes, I get a little lonely when the sun gets low
And I end up looking for somewhere to go
Yes, I should know better but I can't say no
Oh no no no, no no, no no

The lights are low and the music is loud
You watch yourself as you play to the crowd
One more face in a palace of mirrors

One more drink, you're sailing away
One more dream but it's looking okay
One more time to watch the flow of the river

Yes, I get a little lonely when the sun gets low
And I end up looking for somewhere to go
Yes, I should know better but I can't say no
Oh, no no no, no no, no no no no no

You've seen it all, you've seen it before
Like a fool you always come back for more
You live your life like there was no more tomorrow

Night comes down and finds you alone
In a space and time of your own
Lost in dreams in a world full of shadows

Yes, I get a little lonely when the sun gets low
And I end up looking for somewhere to go
Yes, I should know better but I can't say no
Oh no no no, oh no no no, no no no no, no no no no, no no, no no

[Verse 1]
While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

[Chorus]
And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I can find a way, find a way

[Verse 2]
While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God her love is true

[Chorus]
And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I can find a way, while she waits while she waits for me

I was cruisin' with my favorite gang
The place was so boring, filled with out-of-towners touring

At a guy who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

Oh what, wow

Oooh, from his head down to his toes

There was no harmony life meant nothin' to me, until you came along

Feel for the winter, but don't have a cold heart

And I love you best

You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you

She made me think of things I never thought of
Now she's gone and I'm on my own
A love song has come into my mind
A love song, it was there all the time

So lady, let me take a look at you now
You're there on the dance floor, making me want you somehow
Oh lady, I think it's only fair I should say to you
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you, 'cause maybe I do

Look around, come to me
I have no answers, but know where I wanna be
I look around, play a part
I was born in the winter and cooled by a warm heart

And I love you best

If I could be you and you could be me for just one hour
If we could find a way to get inside each other's minds
If you could see you, through my eyes, instead of your ego
I believe you'd be, surprised to see, that you'd been blind

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
And before you abuse
Criticise and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

Now the whole world you see around you is just a reflection
And the law of Karma, says you reap, just what you sow
So unless you've, lived a life of total perfection
You'd better be careful of every stone that you should throw

And yet we spend the day throwing stones at one another
'Cause I don't think or wear my hair the same way you do
Well I may be common people but i'm your brother
And when you strike out and try to hurt me it's a-hurtin you

There are people on reservations and out in the ghettos
And brother, there but for the grace of God go you and I
If I only, had the wings, of a little angel
Don't you know I'd fly, to the top of the mountain, and then I'd cry

Love you forever but you're
Driving me insane

No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die

[Outro]
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Toot toot, hey, beep beep, toot toot, hey, beep beep
Toot toot, hey, beep beep, toot toot, hey, beep beep

[Chorus 1]
Bad girls, talking ’bout the sad girls
Sad girls, talking ’bout bad girls, yeah

[Verse 1]
See them out on the street at night (Walkin')
Picking up all kinds of strangers, if the price is right
You can score if your pocket’s nice
But you want a good time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You ask yourself, ""Who they are?""
Like everybody else, they come from near and far
Woah, bad girls, yeah

[Chorus 1]
Bad girls, (Bad girls) talking ’bout the sad girls (Sad girls)
Sad girls, (Sad girls) talking ’bout bad girls, yeah

[Verse 2]
Friday night and the strip is hot (Hot)
Sun’s gone down and they’re about to trot (Out trottin')
Spirit’s high and they look hot
Do you wanna get down?

[Chorus 2]
Bad girl, sad girl, you’re such a naughty bad girl
Beep beep, uh-huh
You bad girl, you sad girl, you’re such a naughty bad girl
Beep beep, uh-huh

[Verse 3]
Now you and me, we are both the same (Both the same)
But you call yourself by different names (Different names)
Now your Mama won’t like it when she finds out (Finds out)
Girl is out at night

[Verse 1]
Here in my car
I feel safest of all
I can lock all my doors
It's the only way to live
In cars
Here in my car
I can only receive
I can listen to you
It keeps me stable for days
In cars

[Verse 2]
Here in my car
Where the image breaks down
Will you visit me please
If I open my door
In cars?
Here in my car
I know I've started to think
About leaving tonight
Although nothing seems right
In cars

[Instrumental]
