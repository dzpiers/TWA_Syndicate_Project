[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?"" I say

[Chorus]
When I see your face (Face, face)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
And when you smile (Smile, smile)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say

[Chorus]
When I see your face (Face, face)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
And when you smile (Smile, smile)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)

[Post-Chorus]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)

[Chorus]
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah

1,Love The Way You Lie,Recovery,Eminem,2010-06-18,263373,80,"

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

[Chorus: Rihanna & Eminem]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Heyy
He-e-e-e-ey
He-e-e-e-ey

[Verse 1]
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't want to miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Heyy

Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be, with me

[Chorus]
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know

So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend

Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be, and I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine

'Cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape

[Chorus: Jay Sean]
So baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(Down, down)
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(Down, down)
Even if the sky is falling down

[Verse 2: Jay Sean]

Come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away-ay
Turn this place into our private getaway

So leave it behind
'Cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape
So why don't we run away?

Baby, don't worry (Away)
You are my only (Oh-ooh)

Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down?
(Down, down) Mmh, you down?
Even if the sky is falling down

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Down, like she supposed to be, she gets down low for me
Down like her temperature, 'cause to me she zero degree
She cold, over-freeze, I got that girl from overseas
Now she my Miss America, now can I be her soldier, please?
I'm fightin' for this girl on the battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby cupid sending arrows from above?
Don't you ever leave the side of me, indefinitely, not probably
And honestly, I'm down like the economy
Yeah!!

[Refrain: Jay Sean, Lil Wayne]
Baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely (Whoa!)
Even if the sky is falling down (Falling down, baby)
You'll be my only (No-ooh)
No need to worry (No-ooh)
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down? (And the sky is falling down)
(Down, down) Mmh, down (Down, down)
Baby, are you down, down, down, down, down? (Are you down, are you down too?)
(Down, down) Ooh, no-ooh, and the sky is falling down
Even if the sky is falling down

[Outro: Jay Sean, Lil Wayne]
Ooh, no-ooh, and the sky is falling down

[Chorus]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1]
You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

[Chorus]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 2]
You, you, you got your high brow, switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

[Bridge]
'Cause it sure seems (It sure seems) you got no doubts (No doubts)
But we all see (We all see) you got your head in the clouds

[Chorus]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm (Under my arm)
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name

And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'

I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'mma have my own theme music

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha-ha)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (What up, Oprah? Ha-ha)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Sing it) when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

[Outro: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad

21,Mine,Speak Now (Deluxe Package),Taylor Swift,2010-01-01,230773,61,"

[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

[Chorus 2]
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos (Dimelo!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

Concrete jungle (Yeah) where dreams are made of

New York (Yeah), New York (Uh) (I made you hot, nigga)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley
Labor Day Parade—rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo—I'm from the Empire State, that's

Big lights will inspire you (Okay)

New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (Ayy, ow) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)

[Verse 1]
You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Bridge]
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

[Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Chorus]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

[Outro]
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams...

Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

[Verse 1]
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My love of my life
My shorty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right

Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?

So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

[Verse 2]
When I be riding man I swear I see her face at every turn
Trying to get my Usher on but I can't let it Burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for
More and more, I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

[Chorus]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone
And you wishing you could give them everything
Everything (heyyy)
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up

[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""

I'm like: ""forget you,"" and forget her, too
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you (oh, ooh, oooh)

36,Your Love Is My Drug,Animal (Expanded Edition),Kesha,2010-01-01,187133,68,"

[Verse 1]
Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seein' it in my dreams
I'm lookin' down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin'
Hittin' my head against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Verse 2]
Won't listen to any advice
Mama's tellin' me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's gettin' kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time (All the time)
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Bridge]
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

[Verse 3]
Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug?
Your drug
Huh, your drug
Huh, your drug
Is my love your drug?

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Outro]
Hey
Hey, so...
Your love, your love, your love, your love is my drug
I like your beard

[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
And you were strong, and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, when all is done, there is nothing to say
You've gone and so effortlessly
You've won, you can go ahead, tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Verse 2]
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, when all is gone, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own, you can go ahead, tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible (Let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, impossible
(Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now (Yeah)
Shout it from the rooftops (Shout it from the rooftops)
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now (Hey)
Tell them I was happy (Tell them I was happy)
And my heart is broken (And my heart is broken)
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be (Whoa)
Impossible, impossible (Impossible, impossible)
Impossible, impossible (Let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible (Said let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible

[Outro]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag

He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right

Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, ""Nicki don't stop, you the bestest""
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos

[Verse 4: Drake]
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, ""Shake'n Bake"" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her

Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot

[Verse 5: Tyga]
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

Praying won't do it
Hating won't do it
Drinking won't do it
Fighting won't knock you out
Of my head

[Verse 2]
Hiding won't hide it
Smiling won't hide it
Like I ain't tried it
Everyone's tried it now
And failed somehow

[Interlude]
So when you gonna let me
When you gonna let me out, out

[Chorus 1]
And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces
It seems like peace is
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up?
Get up?

[Verse 3]
Cause driving won't do it
Flying won't do it
Denying won't do it
Crying won't drown it out
What you said

[Verse 4]
When I'm standing on the yellow line
Waiting at the station
Or I'm late for work
A vital presentation
If you call me now girl
Without reservation
I would try to break through

[Chorus 2]
And if you know
How do you get up from an all time low?
I'm in pieces
It seems like peace is
The only thing I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?

[Post-Chorus]
I can't even find a place to start
How do I choose between my head and heart?
Till it ceases I'll never know
How do you get up from an all time low?

A low [repeat]
Can you hear me?
A low [repeat]
Can't you hear me?
A low [repeat]
Can you hear me?
A low [repeat]

There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free-for-all
When they—

[Verse 1]
When the dark of the night
Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive
Lookin' for somethin' wild
And now we lookin' like pimps
In my gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey in my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the mornin'
But tonight, I don't give a​—, I don't give a—, I don't give a—

[Chorus]
There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're lookin' for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off

[Verse 2]
Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious, tear it down
'Til the sun comes back around
N-now we gettin' so smashed
Knockin' over trash cans
Errbody breakin' bottles, it's a filthy hot mess
And I'm down to get faded
I'm not the designated driver
So, I don't give a​—, I don't give a—, I don't give a—

50,Back To December,Speak Now,Taylor Swift,2010-10-25,293026,62,"

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time

And your body's so superb
Me and you the best in here
But yo' girl, face and ear
Face and ear, face and ear
Face and ear, face and ear

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, Oh-ho

[Verse 1]
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Post-Chorus]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Verse 2]
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

[Pre-Bridge]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

[Bridge]
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls

Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere

Born and raised in south Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

Finn:
A singer in a smoky room

A smell of wine and cheap perfume

For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill

Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time

Excuse me miss, but can I get you out your panties?

She won't ever get enough once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way, you know that I'd make her say

Absolutely no one that knows me better
No one that can make me feel so good
How did we stay so long together?
When everybody, everybody said we never would

[Pre-Chorus]
And just when I, I start to think they're right
The love has died

[Chorus]
There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time?
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in

Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up
When it doesn't matter who's right, fight about it all night
Had enough
You give me that look
""I'm sorry, baby, let's make up""

You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that

Every night I remember that evening
The way you looked when you said you were leaving
The way you cried as you turned to walk away
The cruel words and the false accusations
The mean looks and the same old frustrations
I never thought that we'd throw it all away
But we threw it all away

And I'm a little bit lost without you
And I'm a bloody big mess inside
And I'm a little bit lost without you
This ain't a love song this is goodbye (oooooh)
This ain't a love song this is goodbye (ooooh)

I've been lost, I've been out, I've been losing
I've been tired, I'm all hurt and confusion
I've been mad, I'm the kind of man that I'm not
I'm going down, I'll be coming back fighting
I may be scared and a little bit frightened
But I'll be back, I'll be coming back to life
I'll be coming back to life

And I'm a little bit lost without you
And I'm a bloody big mess inside
And I'm a little bit lost without you
This ain't a love song this is goodbye (oooooh)
This ain't a love song this is goodbye (ooooh)

Whoooo
And you can try (you can try)
And you can try but you'll never keep me down
And you can try (you can try)
And you can try but you'll never keep me down

La la la la la la la

And I'm a little bit lost without you
And I'm a bloody big mess inside
And I'm a little bit lost without you
This ain't a love song this is goodbye

It's alright (It's alright) cause you can try but you'll never keep me down
It's alright (It's alright) I may be lost but you'll never keep me down
You can try (you can try) you can try but you'll never keep me down
You can't try (you can try) I know i'm lost but I'm waiting to be found
You'll never keep me down

You know why? Cause all the bitches love me

Now you just do you and I'mma do me
Niggas love to hate so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me

This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

On a nigga dancin' and none of them know me

So I'm move my shoulders and I take it real low
They like, how he do that
He can Dougie on the flow
And when that nigga stop they like, Dougie some mo
I'm like, a nigga kinda tired then I pass it to the bro

Down South dance that we learned a lil' too fast
And brought it to the hood and, got the whole crew cash

Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie
All my bitches love me, all my-all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, you ain't fuckin' with my Dougie

Back of the party, I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryin' to get bent and meet a thick redbone
She do her Dougie and all them bitches hatin'
But I'm about to escape with a bitch and head home
She got her friend so it's a two man and
I run it, run it even if her legs long
She like, you hubby
I think she love me
But I change the subject and I do my Dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove, Heff in the back with Playboy bunnies
We gonna make em do the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head the bitch looked at me funny
Duh, bitch you can't tell me nothin'
Starr made the beat, I just took it out the oven
I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans cause the burner keep rubbin'

For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way, yep

Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that

They try to change me, but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan

If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell (I'm not a brat like that)

I'm wrong like that

Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around

[Chorus]
Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Verse 2]
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there

Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It's beating in my chest

Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (To take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (Everybody)
I guess I had to
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
Go to that place to get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Might still be in that place
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
If you're tryna get out
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and
Read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse, he's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap (Rap)
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These ma'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 1]
She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart
While I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how
How we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration
Tryna make it work, but, man, these times are hard

[Verse 2]
She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time
I got a new job now on the unemployment line
And we don't know how
How we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best
Tryna make it work, but, man, these times are hard
But we're gonna start by

[Chorus]
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

[Verse 3]
She's in line at the dole with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
And we both know how
How we're going to make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt
Tryna make it work, but, man, these times are hard
But we're gonna start by

[Chorus]
Drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talking up all night
Doing things we haven't for a while, a while, yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, with Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture-ure-ure-ure
Always hoping for the worst
Waitin' for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That know just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her, ""Keep it drama free""
Woah-woah
(Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Chu-Chuckin' up them deuces
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)

[Verse 2: Tyga & Chris Brown]
Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But, baby, I think it's better if I let you know

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better

You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her, yeah (Say bye-bye)

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on, it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick. she give me déjà vu
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (Oh!)

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her, oh-oh (Deuces)

I hear the pain in her voice

She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seein' my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway

Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!

[Verse 2]
On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a meltin' pot, on the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge

[Hook 2]
I'mma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do

These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say

There's nothin' you can't do

Alors on sort pour oublier tous les problèmes

Alors on danse

[Couplet 2]
Et là tu t’dis que c’est fini
Car pire que ça, ce s'rait la mort
Quand tu crois enfin qu'tu t’en sors
Quand y en a plus, et ben y en a encore
Est-ce la zik ou les problèmes ?
Les problèmes ou bien la musique ?
Ça t’prend les tripes, ça te prend la tête
Et puis tu pries pour qu'ça s’arrête
Mais c’est ton corps, c’est pas le ciel
Alors tu t’bouches plus les oreilles
Et là tu cries encore plus fort, et ça persiste

[Pont]
Alors on chante
Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala
Alors on chante
Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala
Alors on chante
Alors on chante
Et puis seulement quand c’est fini

[Intro: Mr. Hudson]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Just let it run..
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of Young

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Intro]
Ohh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say I love you enough?
Till it's to late, it's not too late

[Verse 2]
Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying

[Verse 2]
And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
'Cause when we long for absolution
There'll no one on the line, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
Yeah, mmm

[Bridge]
You never know a good thing till it's gone
You never see a crash till it's head on
Why do we think we're right when we're dead wrong?
You never know a good thing till it's gone

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell them that we love them while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying

She slides down the pole, like a certified stripper
When we all alone, I might just tip her

[Produced by Boi-1da and Nick Brongers]

[Intro]
Uh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 2]
Uh, one thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

You say ""I love you boy""
But I know you lie
I trust you all the same
And I don't know why

Cause when my back is turned
My bruises shine
Our broken fairytale
So hard to hide

I still believe
It's you and me
Till the end of time

When we collide we come together
If we don't, we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise i know you're worth it
When you hit me, hit me hard

Sitting in a wishing hole
Hoping it stays right
Feet cast in solid stone
I got Gilligan's eyes

I still believe
It's you and me
Till the end of time

When we collide we come together
If we don't, we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise i know you're worth it
When you hit me, hit me hard

Cause you said hello
It's where the going get's hard
Our future is far
Many of horror
Our future's far
Many of horror
Our future is far
Many of horror

I still believe
It's you and me
Till the end of time

When we collide we come together
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise i know you're worth it
When you hit me, hit me hard

Swear you know best
But you expect me to jump up on board with you
And ride off into your delusional sunset

But you'll never see
You're so busy makin' maps with my name on them in all caps
You got the talkin' down, just not the listening

Who made you king of anything?
So, you dare tell me who to be?
Who died and made you king of anything?

Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been

Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you

I can't stop loving you

But I can't stop loving you with half of my

Half of my heart’s got you
Half of my heart’s got the right mind to tell you
Half of my heart won’t do

Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart

Yeah, you've known it the whole time

[Verse 2]
Maybe next year, I'll have no time
To think about the questions to address
Am I the one to try to stop the fire?
I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you
Could have obtained, why try anything?
I will get there; just remember, I know

[Chorus]
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

[Chorus]
And I can tell just what you want
You don't want to be alone
You don't want to be alone
And I can't say it's what you know
But you've known it the whole time
Yeah, you've known it the whole time

[Intro: Tinie Tempah]
Uh, it's okay, I'm good
Let's go!

[Hook: Tinie Tempah & Labrinth]
Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I’m in charge now
I’m a star and I bought my fucking cast out
I live a very, very, very, wild lifestyle
Heidi and Audrina eat your heart out
I used to listen to ""you don’t wanna bring arms house""
I've got so many clothes I keep some in my aunt's house
Disturbing London baby, we about to branch out
Soon I'll be the king like Prince Charles' child
Yeah, yeah and there ain’t nobody fresher
Semester to semester, raving with the freshers
20 light bulbs around my table and my dresser
CLC Kompressor, just in case that don’t impress her
Say hello to Dexter, say hello to Uncle Fester
Got them gazing at my necklace and my crazy sun protectors
G-Shocks, I got a crazy dumb collection
Haters, I can't fucking hear your reception

[Hook: Tinie Tempah & Labrinth]
Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

[Interlude: Tinie Tempah]
Shit was meant to last me 24 hours man

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
They say hello, they say hola and they say bonjour
I’m pissed I never got to fly on a Concorde
I've been Southampton but I've never been to Scunthorpe
I’m fucking crazy with the kicks, call me Jean-Claude
I’m 'bout to be a bigger star than my mum thought
‘Cause every day I got a groupie at my front door
Now I drive past the bus I used to run for
Where’s my fucking clap, where’s my encore?
I walk alone, ‘cause I was born alone
I chirps her just for fun, I never ever call her phone
I leave her in the club, I never ever walk her home
DL the fucking foundation, I'm the cornerstone
I’m born famous, I’m sort of known
And if your son doesn’t, I bet your daughter knows
Check out my visual, check out my audio
Extra ordinary, yo, hope you enjoyed the show

[Hook: Tinie Tempah & Labrinth]
Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

[Bridge: Labrinth & Tinie Tempah]
Woah
Wooooooooo-oah
Woah
Wooooooooo-oah

Look at me I've been a cheeky bastard, man and
Look at all the drama we started, now I’m
In here laying on my back
Saying, ""DJ won't you give me one more track?""

I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning
I'll apologise for tonight, tomorrow morning

[Hook: Labrinth & Tinie Tempah]
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out
So let it rain, let it pour away
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

[Intro]
Kane is in the building

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 1]
Standing on the edge of forever
At the start of whatever
Shouting love at the world
Back then we were like cavemen
But we map the moon and the stars
Then we forgave them

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We will meet you where the lights are
The defendants of the faith we are
When the thunder turns around they’ll run so hard we’ll tear the ground away

You know no one dies
In these love drowned eyes
Through our love drowned eyes
We’ll watch you sleep tonight

[Chorus 1]
Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood
Learning how to dance the rain
We were holding back the flood
They said we’d never dance again

[Verse 2]
Bleeding, but none of us leaving
Watch your mouth son
Or you’ll find yourself floating home

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Here we come now on a dark star
Seeing demons, not what we are
Tiny minds and eager hands will try to strike but now will end today

There’s progress now
Where there once was none
Where there once was none
Then everything came along

[Chorus 2]
Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood
Learning how to dance the rain
There was more of them than us
Now they’ll never dance again
Although no one understood
There was more of them than us
Learning how to dance the rain
We were holding back the flood
They said we’d never dance again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We will meet you where the lights are
The defendants of the faith we are
When the thunder turns around they’ll run so hard we’ll tear the ground away

[Chorus 3]
Although no one understood
There was more of them than us
Learning how to dance the rain
(Learning how to dance the rain)
There was more of them than us
Now they’ll never dance again
Now we’ll never dance again

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

[Bridge]
Throw your soul through every open door (Ooh woah, oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Ooh woah, oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face, then rip the brakes out my car (Ooh-ooh)

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
(Ooh-ooh) You tossed it in the trash; yes, you did

Grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah,) throw my hand on a
Blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah,) I'd jump in front of a
Train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah,) you know I'd
Do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah,) oh-oh-oh-oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby, but you won't do the same

[Bridge]
(No) If my body was on fire
(No) Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
(No) You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But, darlin', I'd still catch a

[Chorus]
Grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah,) throw my hand on a
Blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah,) I'd jump in front of a

Do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah,) oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Liam]
You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus: All & Harry]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

[Verse 2: Zayn]
So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else (Nobody else)

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

[Pre-Chorus 1: Travie McCoy]
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no— (Yeah)

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo
Let's go!

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travie McCoy]
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close (Listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh)
Make me your radio (Come on)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo (Sing along like)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (Yeah, yeah, come on)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh, oh)
Make me your radio (Ah-huh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Haha)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh

[Verse 1]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa

[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again

[Verse 2]
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

You can't help but turn them heads, knocking 'em dead
Dropping like flies around you
If I get your body close, not letting go
Hoping you're about to

Every chance I get, I'ma turn you on

Okay
We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite

Can we all slow down and enjoy right now?
Guarantee we'll be feeling alright

Yeah, yeah, well, keep the price tag and take the cash back
Just give me six strings (Six strings) and a half-stack (Half stack)
And you can, can keep the cars, leave me the garage
And all I, yes, all I need are keys and guitars
And guess what? In thirty seconds, I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah, we leaping across these undefeatable odds
It's like this, man, you can't put a price on a life
We do this for the love, so we fight and sacrifice every night

So bring back the beat and then everyone sing

That you did everything right

[Produced by Fraser T Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Oh

Let it burn

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it, when the light's out

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

[Chorus]
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, woah
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa

[Verse 2]
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the blanket, when the light's out

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

[Chorus]
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, woah
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa

Shame on me (Shame on me)
To need release (To need release)

Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show (I wanna show...) all the dirt I got running through my mind

[Intro]
Don't hold your breath

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

[Verse 1]
I was under your spell for such a long time
Couldn't break the chains
You played with my heart, tore me apart
With all your lies and games
It took all the strength I had
But I crawled up on my feet again
Now you're trying to lure me back
But no, those days are gone my friend
I loved you so much
That I thought someday that you could change
But all you brought me was a heart full of pain

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

[Post-Chorus]
Don't hold your breath

[Verse 2]
I was worried about you
But you never cared about me none
You took my money and I know that you
You could kill someone
I gave you everything
But nothing was ever enough
You were always jealous over such crazy stuff

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

[Post-Chorus]
Don't hold your breath

[Bridge]
Move on (Move on), don't look back (Don't look back)
I jumped off the train runnin' off the tracks
Your day's gone (Your day's gone), face the facts (Face the facts)
A bad movie ends and the screen fades to black

[Break]
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
(You can't touch me now)

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath (Don't hold your breath, no)
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget

[Verse 1]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom

But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn

Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket

Fly, oh my, it's a little bit scary (Hey)
Boys wanna marry, looking at my derrière (Hey, hey)
You can stare but if you touch it I'mma bury
Pretty as a picture (Picture)
Sweeter than a swisher (Swisher)
Mad 'cause I'm cuter than the girl that's with ya
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too, then ladies sing it with me

[Chorus]
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a ten
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I drip

Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful (Hey!)

[Verse 3]
If you're looking for me you can catch me (Hot spot)
Cameras flashing, daddy turned his head as soon as I passed him (Hmm)
Girls think I'm conceited 'cause I know I'm attractive
Don't worry about what I think, why don't you ask him? (Oh-oh-oh)
Get yourself together don't hate (Never do it)
Jealousy's the ugliest trait (Don't ever do it)
I can talk about it 'cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too, then ladies sing it with me

[Chorus]
All eyes on me when I walk in

[Verse 1]
Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

[Verse 2]
To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there's to complain about

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You got to take it in

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh, a good, good life
Yeah
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
Hopelessly, I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly, I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly, I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly, the hope is we have
So much to feel good about

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
Good, good life
Good life
Ooh, ooh
Oh
Listen, to my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there's to complain about

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I’m 6'8""

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9""]
By the time you hear this, I’ll prolly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin’
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
‘Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

153,The A Team,+,Ed Sheeran,2011-09-09,258373,75,"

[Verse 1]
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

[Verse 2]
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

[Bridge]
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die

[Intro: Choir]
All of the lights
Lights, lights
All of the lights

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Post-Chorus: Elly Jackson & Rihanna]
Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are (All of the lights)
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights), lights
Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life, thug life
Rock life every night (All of the lights)

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Them courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
(All of the lights), lights
Cop lights, flashlights, spotlights
Strobe lights, street lights (All of the lights, all of the lights)

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything

Gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get your own
Gettin' mine, baby
Gotta let these niggas know, yeah
Gettin' right, babe
You should go and get your own

[Verse 3: Fergie, Rihanna & Drake]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
'Kay, okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time

Turn up the lights in here, baby

[Verse 1]
Lyin' here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile

[Verse 2]
I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

[Chorus]
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight

[Verse 3]
I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real
No, it's never felt so right

[Chorus]
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight

No, I don't wanna say goodnight
I know it's time to leave
But you'll be in my dreams
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might

So baby, I'm alright, oh

[Verse 1]
I know I can't take one more step towards you
‘Cause all that's waiting is regret
Don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most

[Pre-Chorus]
I've learned to live, half alive
And now you want me one more time

[Chorus]
Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

[Verse 2]
I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
I've learned to live, half alive
And now you want me one more time

[Chorus]
Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?

[Verse 3]
Dear, it took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
‘Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back

[Chorus]
Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
Don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
LA-SER
Yeah, yeah
Kane is in the building, nigga
Yeah

[Chorus: JR Get Money]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Have you ever had the feelin' that you was bein' had?
Don't that shit there make you mad? They treat you like a slave
Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin' through they teeth, hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh (Ha ha) put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats, then get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold, don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Gon' and put your hands up, when times is hard, you stand up
L-U-P the man, 'cause the brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us, they'll never slow my plans up

[Chorus: JR Get Money]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long

Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
One in the air for the people ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me, boy
I hope your son don't have a gun and never be a d-boy

[Chorus: JR Get Money]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So no matter what you been through, no matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home
Even if they turn the lights out, the show is goin' on, alright

[Chorus: JR Get Money]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on

[Part 1: Black Joy]

[Intro]
No no no no no

[Verse 1]
A melanated mother looking at her newborn
A black boy, he see his father in his true form
Strong, vulnerable, grace and poise, and lovable
Ungovernable, ride or die on we thuggin' to
Fondness, tenderness, caring, endearment
Intimacy, spirits you can feel it
Beloved, up above it always covered I can feel it
Thriving always flourishing, somebody tryna to kill it
But we
Stay resilient as the world stay spinning
Stay feeling with that love healing
I feel unity
Mutiny against my oppressors is what be moving me
Love with no power sentimentally
Empower no love, it is tyranny you feeling me?
Warmth and connection to my people most critically
Black love criminalized, seen as a threat
To white supremacy on every corner of the map

[Bridge]
My love
It’s on
Your face
They look

[Chorus 1]
Deep in the brown eyes lie dignity and pride
Rebuilding generations, loving the darkest nation
Hair and skin, texture
It's a celebration
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Seen everywhere, validated and acknowledged
Picked the black doll in a test paying homage
Many different shades on an earth tone rainbow
Stopped look and listen, see we glisten and our frame glow
Pleasure like a soul food plate when you ain't ate
Collard greens, mac and cheese, red velvet cake
We can celebrate
Set it straight
Libation meditate
Increase and educate
Decrease the murder rate
Sharp like in a [?]
Suited and booted
Civilize and refine
Move as a movement
Gorgeous and beautiful
Uplift and multiply
Platforms generate
Incomes to amplify
How we see ourselves, be ourselves, see our wealth
Dreaming of equity, power, and mental health
Self-determination, respect, and dignity
Need spaces that reflect our identity

[Bridge]
My love
It’s on
Your face
They look
(x2)

Nah nah nah nah nah
It wears on my face

[Bridge]
My love
It's on
Your face
They look

[Outro]
It's on my face
Get it get it get it
Like it's every day
Like it's every day
It's on my face
My every day
My every day

[Part II: We The People (Covert/Overt)]

What's good people
It's a pleasure to be here
In the physical
It’s quite rare to see us, you know, all intact
You know what I mean, like
Public enemy for real
Feeling like heavy
Heavy handle like the sky’s made of metal
You feel me?

[Chorus 2]
Lynching, hate crimes, drawn swastikas
[?], burnin’ crosses as they toss to us, [?]
Tokenism, flag waving, white [?]
Blame the victim, paternalism, the lie is missing
(x2)

[Verse 3]
Covert, overt
Saviors here to work
Self-appointed
Trained to disconnect the past from the present moment
Wired to resist the truth
Post-racial attitudes
Claiming [?] through reverse
Benefits from terror moves
Beneficiaries of terrorism and argumentive
Country built off this false premise, y'all offended?
Here to crack on my bones and teeth, no relief
Impunity, for police, there is no belief
Segregation, separatism, restricted covenants
Withdraw the funding, redraw the country
Profiling holidays with slaveowners bootstrap pull up
Standing on my back tell me to get up with sit ups
Conflict, dissonance, instability
Uncertainty, lack of control, stifles ability
Humiliate, reduce, destroy
Imagination that produces joy
Inside the minds of black girls and boys

[Chorus 2]
Lynching, hate crimes, drawn swastikas
[?], burnin’ crosses as they toss to us, [?]
Tokenism, flag waving, white [?]
Blame the victim, paternalism, the lie is missing

162,How To Love,Tha Carter IV (Deluxe),Lil Wayne,2011-01-01,240306,60,"

[Intro]
Cut the music up
A little louder

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Bridge]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

[Chorus]
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love

(feat. Kelis)
I can't believe that every day and every night
It’s getting better with you out of my life
It’s like I flicked a switch and now I’m feeling good
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes I know I'll feel alive
You will be the last thing on my mind
No regrets, do you know what that means?
It's hot, it's now, it's when
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
I can love again tonight
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
Bounce, bounce, bounce
It's, it's now, it's when
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I don't care what anybody thinks about that

[Verse 1: Labrinth]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is something
They call a ground-breaker
So, let me first apologize to the shirts and the ties
For your make-up
Cause I'll make you ugly, as soon as it drops
We're on a rampage, bottles poppin' off
Before you know it, there's rubble and dust
Cause we'll be fuckin' it up
Somebody say 'You better run!'

[Hook: Labrinth]
Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, ""Yeah!""
I predict an earthquake up in here
Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
Hey, yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here

[Verse 2: Labrinth]
Ladies and gentleman
What you're about to witness is no illusion
And now, we got the bass banging
From here to Buckingham Palace
They're all moving
Hey Simon, we're fucking them up, turnin' them SyCo
Everybody rock, let's bring the house down
To rubble and dust cause we'll be fuckin' it up
Somebody say 'You better run!'

Yeah!

Without a match or lighter
Don't do girlfriends, one nighters

Doing all nighters, no days off
Gray hairs and a little bit of weight loss
I predict (riots!)

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I’m not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it, oh

[Verse 1: Professor Green]
Nothing to hide, stifle or smother
Suffered and cried, strife made me tougher
Never mumbled or shy to trouble I rise above all
Expectations forget rep
Ain’t never begged yet
When I wanted to get pence hustle
To be I am exactly what my neck says
That sket said I tried to cash in on my Dad's death
I wanted to vent but I never said fuck all
After all you were never kin to me
Family is something that you never been to me
In fact making it harder for me to see my father
Was the only thing that you ever did for me

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I’m not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it, oh

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
(Dear Dad)
As a kid I looked up to you
Only thing was I never saw enough of you
The last thing I said to you was I hated you
I loved you and now it's too late to say to you
Just didn't know what to do and how to deal with it
Even now deep down I'm still livid
To think I used to blame me
I wonder what I did to you to make you hate me
I wasn't even 5, life's a journey and mine wasn't an easy ride
You never even got to see me rhyme
I just wish you woulda reached out
I wish you would have been round when I been down
I wish that you could see me now
Wherever you are I really hope you found peace
But know that if I ever have kids
Unlike you I'll never let them be without me

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I’m not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it, oh

(I write songs I can't listen to
Everything I have to give to you
And everyone of these lines I sing to you)

[Bridge: Professor Green]
My job's more like public service
My life just became yours to read and interpret
If you heard it and come across a lot different at times
I throw fits when I read how they word things
You see me smile
Now you're gonna have to see me hurting
Cause pretending everything is all right
When it ain't, really isn't working

[Hook: Emeli Sandé]
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I’m not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it, oh

[Outro: Professor Green]
I ain't censoring myself for nobody
I'm the only thing I can be
All that is good, all that is bad, all that is, me

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I’m not afraid

Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupée

If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari

Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said ""On my dick""
I ain't really mean to say ""On my dick""
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done

Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Let's go!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref'
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it (Have it)

Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)

Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit
No, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with an elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said ""shoot 'em"", and I said ""okay""
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, ""¡Olé!""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
(Nope) Not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, ""Fuck trial""
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!

Look at me now (Haha! Oh), look at me now (Yeah)

168,Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall,Mylo Xyloto,Coldplay,2011-10-24,240796,67,"

[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

[Chorus]
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise the flag

Oh, it was a wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
A wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)

Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

Yeah!
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything! Money on my mind!""
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake"", girl don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Outro]
I be yelling out ""Money over everything!""
""Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!""
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…

[Outro Poem]
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better

Time flies when I’m on that ass but I won’t put your shit on blast
Work it like a pro-pro-pro, sit and watch it go-go-go
Do her thing all on the flo', she bounce it fast and shake it slow

Got you niggas checking game, I’m ballin' out on every level

Come on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here

And you'll be owning all the fines

Suckle on the hope in light brassieres

180,Wherever You Will Go,Wherever You Will Go,Charlene Soraia,2011-10-03,197577,58,"

So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall, and fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone, could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out a way to make it back, someday
To watch you, to guide you, through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall, and fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will...

No! Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind, I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine
I'll go wherever you will go
I'll go wherever you will go

Here to relive your darkest moments

And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh

I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way

But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope

[Video Intro: Agyness Deyn]
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

[Chorus: Rihanna]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Give me a second I

I need to get my story straight

My friends are in the bathroom

Getting higher than the empire state

My lover she is waiting for me

Just across the bar

My seat's been taken by some sunglasses

Asking 'bout a scar

And I know I gave it to you months ago

I know you're trying to forget

But between the drinks and subtle things

The holes in my apologies

You know I'm trying hard to take it back

So if by the time the bar closes

And you feel like falling down

I'll carry you home

Tonight

We are young

So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

Tonight

We are young

So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

Now I know that I'm not

All that you got

I guess that I

I just thought maybe we could find a ways to fall apart

But our friends are back

So let's raise a toast

Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight

We are young

So let's the set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

Tonight

We are young

So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

Carry me home tonight

Just carry me home tonight

Carry me home tonight

Just carry me home tonight

The moon is on my side

I have no reason to run

So will someone come and carry me home tonight

The angels never arrived

But I can hear the choir

So will someone come and carry me home

Tonight

We are young

So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

Tonight

We are young

So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter

Than the sun

So if by the time the bar closes

And you feel like falling down

I'll carry you home tonight

[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

[Bridge]
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door

Being the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

You'd never fall in love

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, I love you

Days like this, I want to drive away

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone (Sleepin' here alone)
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want (Do the things I want)

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'll come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on and over you

[Verse 1]
All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Outro]
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

You gotta be the first to run

Just don't get attached to
Somebody you could lose

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind: It was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn & Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to

Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things

But could not count to ten
How she got lots of different horses

And I say liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high but in the hole there's water
You can get some when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo

Got a hurricane at back of her throat
She thinks she's made of candy

Mother was a victim
Father beat the system
By moving bricks to Brixton
And learning how to fix them

Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high but in the hole there's water
As you will, she'll be the whole of the law

What are you doing it for
Now tell me

[Verse 1]
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

[Verse 2]
On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

[Bridge]
Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

[Pre-Chorus]
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause...

[CHILDREN]
The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years

The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds that rise
From the lake to the trees

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

[CAPTAIN]
I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before

My heart will be blessed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say

Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds

Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better to never ask why

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame

Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try

There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns

P-p-party rocker, fa' sho' stopper
More Chambull, number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off then I make that move
Somehow, some way, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Wild out, baby, 'til the freak, it shows
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me high pain
Tolerance, bottoms up when the champagne
My life, call my hanna to be explain
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane

[Chorus: Sia with Flo Rida]
Hey, I heard you are a wild one
Ooh-ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh-ooh

[Bridge: Sia, Flo Rida, both]
I am a wild one, break me in (Yeah)
Saddle me up and let's begin (Yeah, yeah)
I am a wild one, tame me now (Now, now)
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body, dominate you 'til you've had enough
I hear you like the wild stuff

[Chorus: Sia & Flo Rida, Sia]
Hey, I heard you were a wild one
Ooh-ooh (Oh)
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club
With you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh-ooh

[Outro: Sia]
I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl

231,Somebody That I Used To Know,Somebody That I Used To Know,Gotye,2011-01-01,244884,54,"

[Verse 1: Gotye]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse 3: Kimbra]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye & Kimbra]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ahhh)
And I don't even need your love (Oooh)
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (Ahhh)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Oooh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ahhh)
I guess that I don't need that though (Oooh)
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Outro: Gotye]
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
(I used to know)
(That I used to know)
(I used to know)
Somebody

232,Impossible,James Arthur (Deluxe),James Arthur,2013-11-04,209440,76,"

[Intro]
Mmm-hmm, mm

[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Verse 2]
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

[Bridge]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did

[Outro]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
Hoped would be
Impossible (impossible), impossible (impossible)
Impossible, impossible
Impossible (impossible), impossible (impossible)
Impossible, impossible

[Intro: Amy]
Oh, yeah
Uh, c'mon, yeah

[Verse 1: Amy]
This is more than the typical kinda thing
Felt a jones in my bones when you were touching me
Uh-oh, didn’t wanna take it slow
In a daze, goin' craze, I can barely think
You’re replayin' in my brain, find it hard to sleep
Uh-oh, waitin' for my phone to blow
Uh-oh, yup

[Pre-Chorus: Amy]
Now I’m here in a sticky situation
Got a bit of trouble, yup, and now I’m pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it’s been an hour
I don’t wanna think too hard, but I’m sour
Uh-oh, I can’t seem to let you go

[Chorus: Amy]
See, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby
So let’s get up, let’s get on it
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right
Honest, baby, I’ll do anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right, cheerio!

[Verse 2: Amy]
What’s the time? Such a crime, not a single word
Sippin' on that Patrón, just to calm my nerves
Uh-oh, poppin’ bottles by the phone, oh yeah
Had me up, had me down, turned me inside out
That’s enough, call me up, baby, I’m in doubt
Uh-oh, and I don’t even think you know
No, no, no

[Chorus: Amy]
See, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby
So let’s get up, let’s get on it
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right
Honest, baby, I’ll do anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right, cheerio, ay

[Bridge: Amy]
Anything you wanna do, I’ll be on it too
Everything you said, is like gold with a view
Business in the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack?
This kinda thing doesn’t happen usually
I’m on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it, so come and get it
Cheerio

[Chorus: Amy]
See, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
So let’s get up, let’s get on it
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight (Oh-oh-whoa-oh, yeah)
Honest, baby, I’ll do anything you want to (Thing that you want)
So can we finish what we started?
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight (Hey!)
Come on, uh, that’s right! Cheeri-cheerio, uh

[Outro: Amy]
When you gonna call?
Don’t leave me brokenhearted
I’ve been waiting up, let’s finish what we started
Oh-oh (Oh-oh), I can’t seem to let you go
Come on, that’s right, cheerio, uh

[Verse 1: John Martin]
There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memories on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

[Bridge: John Martin]
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

[Hook: John Martin]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

[Verse 2: John Martin]
There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
We ruled the world, I thought I'll never lose her out of sight
We were so young, I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs reminding me of a friend

[Bridge: John Martin]
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heartbreak
I still remember how it all changed
My father said

[Hook: John Martin]
Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
Yeah!

[Bridge: John Martin]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
See heaven's got a plan for you

Don't you worry, don't you worry, child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now

235,Demons,Night Visions,Imagine Dragons,2012-09-04,175200,71,"

[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Bridge]
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, ""Show me something""
He said, “If you dare, come a little closer”

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

[Bridge: Rihanna & Mikky Ekko]
Ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Chorus]
Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave
Primadonna girl

[Verse 1]
Would you do anything for me?
Buy a big diamond ring for me?
Would you get down on your knees for me?
Pop that pretty question right now, baby
Beauty queen on a silver screen
Living life like I'm in a dream
I know I've got a big ego
I really don't know why it's such a big deal though

[Refrain 1]
(Ooh) And I'm sad to the core, core, core
(Yeah) Every day is a chore, chore, chore
(Wow) When you give, I want more, more, more
I wanna be adored

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave
Primadonna girl

[Verse 2]
Fill the void up with celluloid
Take a picture, I'm with the boys
Get what I want 'cause I ask for it
Not because I'm really that deserving of it
Living life like I'm in a play
In the limelight I want to stay
I know I've got a big ego
I really don't know why it's such a big deal though

[Refrain 2]
(Ooh) Going up, going down, down, down
(Yeah) Anything for the crown, crown, crown
(Wow) When the lights dimming down, down, down
I spin around

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm a Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave

[Chorus]
Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe

[Chorus: Icona Pop & Charli XCX]
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge, I watched, I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge, I don't care!
I love it, I don't care!
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge, I watched, I let it burn
I threw your shit into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge, I don't care!
I love it, I don't care!

[Bridge: Icona Pop]
You're on a different road, I'm in the Milky Way
You want me down on Earth, but I am up in space
You're so damn hard to please, we gotta kill this switch
You're from the '70s, but I'm a '90s bitch

[Chorus: Icona Pop & Charli XCX]
I love it! I love it!
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge, I watched, I let it burn

240,Not Over You,Sweeter,Gavin DeGraw,2011-09-16,218520,68,"

[Verse 1]
Dreams: that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

[Bridge]
And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then...

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

[Outro]
Not over you (Not over you)
Not over you (Not over you)
Not over you (Not over you)

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart (I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong? (I'm wide awake)
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine

[Verse 2]
I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet (I'm wide awake)
Need nothing to complete myself, no (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend (And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

Crashing from the high

I'm falling from cloud nine (I'm wide awake)

Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am trying to hold on (I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore

[Verse 1]
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Verse 2]
I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious

Blow me one last kiss

Have you had a shit day?

Anything that I want

I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the ""why's"" will be crystal clear

[Produced by Mike Rosenberg and Chris Vallejo]
[Video by Dave Jensen and Tavic]

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
And you let her go
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
When you let her go
Whoa

[Hook]
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

[Pre-Chorus]
Now take it in but don't look down...

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

[Verse 2]
I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Now take it in, but don't look down...

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but

Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh

This is it, boys, this is war
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
What are we waiting for?
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Save that for the black and white
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

And that's alright (That's Alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who, I, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm, mmm

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

[Bridge]
(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No, when I see stars, when I s-
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So come on, oh come on, oh come on
Oh come on

[Verse 2]
Well, that is it, guys, that is all
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Five minutes in, and I'm bored again
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we both agreed
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
For the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh

So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes

Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers

There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

[Chorus: Rihanna & Drake]
'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you, instead, they say

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1]
When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe
To make you well, to make you well

[Verse 2]
When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town

This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should

That it's not you, it's me

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 1]
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
The wound heals but it never does
That’s cause you're at war with love
You're at war with love, yeah

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruin's ruin me
Arrow holes that never close from Cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding on another lover's phone sends you back into the zone
(Go!) With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

[Pre-Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
'Cause I’m the only one that's tryna keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
(And just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming ""medic""
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armors and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

[Pre-Chorus 2: Guy Sebastian]
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop cause it hurts so much
'Cause I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Bridge: Guy Sebastian & Lupe Fiasco]
'Cause you've set me on fire
I’ve never felt so alive, yeah
No, hoping wounds heal, but it never does
That's because you're at war with love
And I’m at the point of breaking
And it’s impossible to shake it

[Pre-Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love
Hope it heals, but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love!

These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
I ain't ever gonna change
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
I ain't ever gonna change

260,Ass Back Home (feat. Neon Hitch),The Papercut Chronicles II,Gym Class Heroes,2011-11-11,222213,61,"

Oh!
You're so sexy, yo!

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get yourself back home

We knew this type of life didn’t come with instructions
So I’m trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright in fact
When you call and I don’t know what city I’m at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month

In a year I don’t recall
It’s like my life’s on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn’t be long
That was last November, now December’s almost gone
I’d apologize but I don’t realize what I’m doing wrong

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get yourself back home

And you’ve been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o ‘cause they’d a just been over it

Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don’t hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We’ll just drive by and keep waving

'Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
'Cause they be swallowing it

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get yourself back home

No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
We’ll be alright in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Let’s go

I don’t care what you’re after
As long as I’m the one, no
I don’t care why you’re leaving
You’ll miss me when you’re gone

I don’t know, where you’re going
Or when you’re coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
I don’t know, where you’re going
Just get yourself back home

I'm home baby!
Ha Ha

261,I Won't Give Up,Love Is a Four Letter Word (Deluxe Edition),Jason Mraz,2012-04-13,240165,70,"

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

[Chorus]
Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

[Verse 2]
And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

[Chorus]
'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

[Chorus]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up
Well, I won't give up on us
God knows I'm tough enough
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it (And we're worth it)

[Outro]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

263,Lights - Single Version,Bright Lights (Lights Re-pack / Bonus Version),Ellie Goulding,2010-01-01,210853,62,"

I had a way then losing it all on my own
I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Home

Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place the only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Home
(Light, lights, lights, lights)
(Light, lights, lights, lights)
Home, home (Light, lights, lights, lights)

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Home, home (Light, lights, lights, lights)
Home, home (Light, lights, lights, lights)

You let all the girls go
Makes you feel good, don't it?

정숙해 보이지만 놀 땐 노는 여자
이때다 싶으면 묶었던 머리 푸는 여자

때가 되면 완전 미쳐 버리는 사나이
근육보다 사상이 울퉁불퉁한 사나이

Have to go and throw water on my flame

When we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colours on our skin
We were light and paper thin

And when we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colours on our skin
Till we let the spectrum in

Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we'll never be afraid again

Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we'l never be afraid again

Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we'll never be afraid again

And when we come for you
We'll be dressed up all in blue
With the ocean in our arms
Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms

And when it's time to pray
We'll be dressed up all in grey
With metal on our tongues
And silver in our lungs

Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we'll never be afraid again

Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we'll never be afraid again

Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we'll never be afraid again

So, say my name

Big full breasts on my baby

Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all

Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace

Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl

No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

You won’t find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice or staying out ’til three
You won’t ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
You won’t find him tryna change the devil
For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

When the money’s spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can’t seem to find no help or love for free
I know that there’s no need for me to panic
'Cause I’ll find him, I’ll find him next to me
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need’s a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me

Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good

Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita

Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And right there is where I wanna stay (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows
Yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah
Can I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?
Oh oh oh oh, yeah yeah yeah
Can I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?

[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long, for too long

[Outro]
Aw, yeah yeah yeah yeah (Ooh)
Aw, yeah yeah
Aw, yeah yeah yeah yeah (Ooh)

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, Young Money, Nicki Minaj, Justin, rrr

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Show you off
Tonight, I wanna show you off (Ayy-ayy-ayy)
What you got
A billion could've never bought (Ayy-ayy-ayy)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Body rock
Girl, I can feel your body rock (Ayy-ayy-ayy)
Take a bow
You're on the hottest ticket now, ooh (Ayy-ayy-ayy)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I want to show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, uh
In time, ink lines
Bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tours, it's mine
Ten little letters on a big sign
Justin Bieber, you know I'ma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, wiener, but I gotta keep an eye out for Selener
Beauty, beauty and the beast
Beauty from the East
Beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets, beat will get deceased
Every time Beauty on the beat eats

[Break: Justin Bieber & Nicki Minaj]
Body rock (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, I wanna feel your body rock (Let's go, let's go)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause all (All I need is love), I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete (Whoa-oh-oh)
It's all 'bout you (All I need is you)
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do

286,Heart Attack,Demi,Demi Lovato,2013-01-01,210840,78,"

[Intro]
Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

[Verse 1]
Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you, make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

[Verse 2]
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

[Bridge]
The feelings are lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb (I'd rather be numb)
You know there's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)
So scared, I'll take off in a run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I'll burst into flames

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack (Heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack (-Tack)
Oh, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

[Intro: Pitbull]
Ask for money, and get advice
Ask for advice, get money twice
I'm from the dirty, but that chico nice
Y'all call it a moment, I call it life

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
One day when the light is glowin'
I’ll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh, I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh, I just wanna feel this moment

Mr. Worldwide
Christina Aguilera
Oye, mamita, come on!
Dalé, que la cosa está rica (I just wanna feel this moment)

[Beat Break]

[Pitbull]
Woo!
Feel this moment!

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Reporting live from the tallest building in Tokyo
Long ways from them hard ways
Bills and Os and oh-yays
Dade County always, 305 all day
Now, baby, we can parlay or, baby, we can party
She read books, especially about red rooms and tie-ups (Yeah)
I got it hooked, ‘cause she seen me in a suit with the red tie tied up
Christian Gris, nice to meet ya
But time is money, only difference is I own it
Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera & (Pitbull)]
One day when the light is glowin'
I’ll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh (C'mon), I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh (C'mon), I just wanna feel this moment

[Beat Break]

[Post-Chorus: Pitbull]
Woo!
Come on, feel this moment!

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I see the future but live for the moment
Make sense, don't it? Hah
Now make dollars, I mean billions (Yeah)
I'm a genius, I mean brilliant (Brilliant)
This street is what schooled him (Schooled him)
And made him slicker than Slick Rick the Ruler (Yeah)
I've lost a lot and learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated like Shula
I'm far from cheap
I break down companies with all my peeps (That's right)
Baby, we can travel the world
And what I can give you is all you can see
Time is money, only difference is I own it
Like a stopwatch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment, dalé

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera & (Pitbull)]
One day when the light is glowin'
I’ll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh (C'mon), I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh, I just wanna feel this moment
(Woo)
(Come on, feel this moment!)
Whoa-oh, I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh, I just wanna feel this moment

[Verse 1: Harry]
Maybe it's the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards
Just like she already owned it

[Pre-Chorus: Zayn]
I said, ""Can you give it back to me?""
She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams""

[Chorus: All]
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes

Said her name was Georgia Rose
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

[Pre-Chorus: Niall]
I said, ""Can I take you home with me?""
She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams""

[Chorus: All]

289,I Knew You Were Trouble.,Red (Big Machine Radio Release Special),Taylor Swift,2012-10-22,219720,76,"

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 1]
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I’ll be there to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me  (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Bridge]
Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now (You show me, baby)
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy

291,Still into You,Paramore,Paramore,2013-04-05,216013,79,"

[Verse 1]
Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause after all this time, I'm still into you

[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you

[Verse 2]
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever

[Pre-Chorus]
And after all this time, I'm still into you

[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby, even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you

[Bridge]
Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)
I'm into you
Baby, not a day goes by
That I'm not into you

[Chorus]
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)

I'm into you (I'm into you)

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find

And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

[Verse 1: Foxes]
High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash 'cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

[Chorus: Foxes]
'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you

I'm like yeah, whatever, we’re still living like that (Like that)
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups
Singin', ""Here's to never growing up""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
(Here's to never growing up)
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa (So raise your glass and say)
Cheers to never growing up

[Outro]
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
(Here's to never growing up)
No, we're never growing up
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Here's to never growing up

[Intro: Ariana Grande & Mac Miller]
What we gotta do right here is go back
Back into time
I love the way you make me feel (Okay)
I love it, I love it (Yeah)
I love the way you make me feel
I love it (Yeah), I love it (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Ariana Grande]
Say
I'm thinkin' 'bout her every second, every hour
Do my singin' in the shower, pickin' petals off of flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? (Love me not)
I ain't a player, I just—
You give me that kinda somethin'
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away

[Refrain 1: Ariana Grande]
If you want what I got, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave ya
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Mac Miller]
So don't you worry
Baby, you got me (Ayy)
I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (Hey)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I love the way (You make me feel)
I love the way (I love it, I love it)
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way, the way I love you (I love it, I love it)

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Ooh, it's so crazy, you get my heart jumpin'
When you put your lips on mine
And honey, it ain't a question (Qu—qu—question)
'Cause, boy, I know just what you like

[Refrain 2: Ariana Grande]
So if you need it, I got it, I got it every day
Be your lover, your friend, you'll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave ya
Said I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don't you worry
Baby, you got me
I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (Hey)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I love the way (You make me feel)
I love the way (I love it, I love it)
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way, the way I love you (I love it, I love it)

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
I make you feel so fine, make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time
Said your bed be feelin' lonely, so you sleepin' in mine
Come and watch a movie with me, American Beauty
Or Bruce Almighty, that's groovy, just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for ya I'm not gonna get bored of
But, baby, you an adventure so let me come and explore ya

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Mac Miller]
So don't you worry (Yeah)
Baby, you got me (Woo)

You got my heart, don't know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

[Chorus (Extended): Ariana Grande]
I love the way, I love the way (You make me feel)

Baby, I love the way, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it, I love it)
I love the way (You make me feel)

Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way, the way I love you (I love it, I love it)

[Intro]
Baby squirrel, you's a sexy motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Gimme your, gimme your, gimme your attention, baby
I gotta tell you a little somethin' about yourself!
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh, you're a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else (Else)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, whoa-oh-oh
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
(Fine, so fine)
Oh, whoa-oh-oh
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine

Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-h-h-h

[Verse 2]
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl, you should be smiling
(You should be smiling)
A girl like you should never look so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, whoa-oh-oh
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
(Fine, so fine)
Oh, whoa-oh-oh
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine

305,Everything Has Changed,Red (Big Machine Radio Release Special),Taylor Swift,2012-10-22,245413,65,"

[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
(You good to go?)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift &  Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, ""Hello""
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

306,The Other Side,Tattoos (Deluxe Edition),Jason Derulo,2013-09-10,226986,49,"

[Prod. by Joshua ""Ammo"" Coleman and Martin Johnson]

[Verse 1]
In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin'
Smilin' in the photo booth
But we got closer (Yeah)
'Til you were eating off my spoon
You're coming over
And we would talk all afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We’re going all the way""

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

[Verse 2]
Wait, this could be perfect (Yeah)
But we won't know unless we try (Try)
I know you're nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We’re going all the way""

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Kiss me like it's do or die
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And take me to the other side

[Bridge]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We’re going all the way""

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July (Yes they do, yeah)
Just take me to the other side (Take me, baby)
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight (So tonight)
Kiss me like it's do or die (Kiss me, kiss me)
And take me to the other side

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

307,Demons,Night Visions,Imagine Dragons,2012-09-04,177506,79,"

[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Bridge]
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

If our love is running out of time
I won't count the hours, rather be a coward
When our words collide
I'm gonna drown you out before I lose my mind

I can't find your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough

I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing, I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak

[Verse 1]
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

[Chorus]
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life

Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

[Bridge]
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in

Don't you ever say I just walked away

[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Outro]
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Verse 1]
The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""High, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

[Verse 2]
Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

[Chorus]
Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
""High, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

[Bridge]
And I can't see you here, wonder where I might
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found all I was hopin' to find
You said you got to be up in the mornin'
Gonna have an early night
And you're startin' to bore me, baby
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""

[Outro]
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?""
""Why'd you only ever phone me when you're (high)?""

Why am I holding on?

We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?

This is our last night, but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake

But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own

'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory

But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close

Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better to never ask why

Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 1: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 2: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar, band]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey!
Hey!

[Bridge: Nanna, Ragnar]
You're gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart; there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

[Chorus: Nanna & Ragnar, band]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

And with every touch, you fixed them

It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—

But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

[CHILDREN]
The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years

The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds that rise
From the lake to the trees

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

[CAPTAIN]
I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before

My heart will be blessed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

Know I've done wrong
I left your heart torn
Is that what devils do?
Took you so low
Where only fools go
I shook the angel in you

Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do

Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

Can you love me again?
Can you love me again?

It's unforgivable
I stole and burnt your soul
Is that what demons do?
They rule the worst of me
Destroy everything
They bring down angels like you

Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do

334,Let Her Go,All The Little Lights,Passenger,2012-11-05,252866,73,"

[Produced by Mike Rosenberg and Chris Vallejo]
[Video by Dave Jensen and Tavic]

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
And you let her go
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
When you let her go
Whoa

[Hook]
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home

[Verse 1]
I don't know why
You think that you could hold me
When you couldn't get by by yourself
And I don't know who
Would ever want to tear the seam of someone's dream
Baby, it's fine, you said that we should just be friends
Well I came up with that line and I'm sure
That it's for the best
If you ever change your mind, don't hold your breath

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
When you said goodbye, my whole world shined

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling
If we're drinking, then I'm buying
And I know there's no denying
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's playing
And even if it started raining
You wouldn't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one that got away
It's a beautiful day

[Verse 2]
It's my turn to fly, so girls, get in line
'Cause I'm easy, no playing this guy like a fool
'Cause now I'm alright
You might've had me caged before, but not tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
This fire inside, it burns too bright
I don't want to say “so long”, I just want to say “goodbye”

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling
If we're drinking, then I'm buying
And I know there's no denying
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up and the music's playing
And even if it started raining
You wouldn't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one that got away

'Cause if you ever think I'll take up
My time with thinking of our break-up
Then you've got another thing coming your way
'Cause it's a beautiful day

Beautiful day
Oh, baby, any day that you're gone away
It's a beautiful day

[Verse 1]
All I want is nothing more
To hear you knocking at my door
'Cause if I could see your face once more
I could die a happy man, I'm sure
When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side

[Chorus]
But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody
Like you, oh, oh, oh
Like you, like you

[Verse 2]
So you brought out the best in me
A part of me I'd never seen
You took my soul and wiped it clean
Our love was made for movie screens

[Chorus]
But if you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
If you loved me, why'd you leave me?
Take my body, take my body
All I want is, and all I need is
To find somebody, I'll find somebody
Like you

Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

[Chorus: Brenda Russell with Flo Rida]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next, get a call, just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Buggatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears, dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic

[Chorus: Brenda Russell with Flo Rida]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""

I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
You know, the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out the cage, I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

[Pre-Chorus]
But my songs know what you did in the dark

[Chorus]
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark

[Verse 2]
Well all the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (Died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
Through a constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

[Pre-Chorus]
My songs know what you did in the dark

[Chorus]
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Oh (Thanks for warning me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talkin' 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin'
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & JAY-Z]
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
No, we all just entertainers

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water

[Pre-Chorus: JAY-Z]
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why
Why I love you so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name?
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair

346,Sweet Nothing (feat. Florence Welch),18 Months,Calvin Harris,2012-10-29,212560,71,"

[Verse 1]
You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

[Chorus]
So I'll put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Verse 2]
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

[Chorus]
So I'll put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Bridge]
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing

Sweet nothing

[Intro: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Ooh-oh
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit tied
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby
'Cause I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
I be on my suit and tie, shit tied, shit
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Wait a minute
You ready, JT?

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-lookin'
Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow! Burned myself, but just had to touch it
And it's so fine, and it's all mine
Hey, baby, we don't mind all the watchin' (High)
'Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn somethin'
She ain't nothin' but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things
Show you a few things about love, hey

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Stop, let me get a good look at it
So thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
And ow!
Shit so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
That's alright, 'cause you're all mine (You're all mine)
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad
'Cause, girl, they wish they had it
My killer, my Thriller, yeah, you're a classic
And you're all mine, tonight

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight

Show you a few things about love
Now we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Get out your seat, Hov!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Uh!
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban linx
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about? I'm at the rest-
-aurant with my rant disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
Uh!
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel, Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young, uh!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'USSÉ's on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her 'cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, huh! Uh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
Let me show you a few things (A few things)
Show you a few things about love, love, love
Let me show you a few things (A few things)
Show you a few things about love, hey

[Verse 1]
Sunlight comes creepin' in
Illuminates our skin
We watched the day go by
Stories of what we did
It made me think of you
It made me think of you

[Verse 2]
Under a trillion stars
We danced on top of cars
Took pictures of the stage
So far from where we are
They made me think of you
They made me think of you

[Chorus]
Oh, lights go down
In the moment, we're lost and found
I just wanna be by your side
If these wings could fly
For the rest of our lives

[Verse 3]
I'm in a foreign state
My thoughts, they slip away
My words are leavin' me
They caught an aeroplane
Because I thought of you
Just for the thought of you

[Chorus]
Oh, lights go down
In the moment, we're lost and found
I just wanna be by your side
If these wings could fly
Oh, damn these walls
In the moment, we're ten feet tall
And how you told me after it all
We'd remember tonight
For the rest of our lives

If these wings could fly

[Chorus]
Oh, lights go down
In the moment, we're lost and found
I just wanna be by your side

And how you told me after it all

[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up

[Verse 1]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl, why is you lying? Girl, why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)

Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So, therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up

[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do (No, no)
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you (You and me)
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

Hol' up, hol' up

Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

[Verse 1]
But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

[Chorus]
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 2]
So break my step
And relent
Well you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way
Shake the excess

[Chorus]
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

[Verse 3]
So I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

[Verse 4]
But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground

[Bridge]
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

[Chorus]
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

You light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don’t
Need that much, just some
One that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

[Verse 2]
This world is getting colder, strangers passing by (Mh-mh-mh-mh)
No one offers you a shoulder, no one looks you in the eye, eye, eye (Mh-mh-mh-mh)
But I’ve been looking at you for a long, long time
Just trying to break through, trying to make you mine
Everybody wants a flame, they don’t want to get burnt
Well, today is our turn

[Chorus]
Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don’t
Need that much, just some
One that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

[Bridge]
Mmmh, our bonfire hearts
Mmmh, our bonfire hearts
Oh, our bonfire hearts
Mmmh, you light the spark

[Breakdown]
People like us, we don’t
Need that much, just some
One that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

[Chorus]
Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart (Two, three, four)
People like us, we don’t
Need that much, just some
One that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts
Our bonfire hearts

[Chorus]
Days like these lead to
Nights like this lead to
Love like ours
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
People like us, we don’t
Need that much, just some
One that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

367,Somewhere Only We Know,Sheezus,Lily Allen,2014-05-02,208504,62,"

[Verse 1]
I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting tired and I need someone to rely on

[Verse 2]
I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

[Chorus]
And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need someone to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

[Chorus]
And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
'Cause this could be the end of everything
So why don't we go
Somewhere only we know
Somewhere only we know

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (You should know)

First things first, I'm the realest (Realest)
Drop this and let the whole world feel it (Let 'em feel it)
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm giving lessons in physics (Right, right?)
You should want a bad bitch like this (Huh?)
Drop it low and pick it up just like this (Yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist (On my wrist)
Taking all the liquor straight, never chase that (Never)
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back (What?)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spilling, you should taste that

I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh

I said baby, I do this, I thought that you knew this
Can't stand no haters, and honest, the truth is
That my flow retarded, each beat dear, departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop in no department
And get my money on time, if they got money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that I give that line a rewind
Said I get my money on time, if they got money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be that I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw

Still stunting, how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that

[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road, I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

[Pre-Chorus]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

[Post-Chorus]
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
Now, I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you, ooh

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

Ooh, girl, you're shining like a 5th Avenue diamond

Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me?
When I just wanna make you smile?

Simmer down, simmer down
They say we’re too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don’t swim, you’ll drown
But don’t move, honey

In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down, hey
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone, just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

[Chorus: All]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
I made a mixtape straight out of ‘94
I’ve got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I’m so down, all
Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, hey

Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find

And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (Mmm, yeah)
I say, ""I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl
He says, ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I""
I said, ""I've been there too a few times""

Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: Harry]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: Harry]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?

Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya

Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet

And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Inside the necklace you got when you were 16

Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, well that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages

And I won't ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home""

And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Intro: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at her butt, look at, look at, look at, look at her butt

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Thi-this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Di-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

[Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby
(Black, black widow, baby)

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

You used to be thirsty for me (Right)
But now you wanna be set free

And you've come around at the curtains of the waterfall
And you rushed to me and it sets us free

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

[Verse 2]
My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tiger's on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)

That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

[Bridge]
(Oh, oh-oh)
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
(Oh, oh-oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (Ruler)

And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)

[Intro]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to fake it
The only time we really talk
Is when our clothes are coming off
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
You are my glass half empty
Sipping my ocean dry
Emotionally spin me
'Till none of our planets could align
But I could stand you one more night

[Chorus]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 2]
You are a catch-22, either way I miss out
All of the grief I give you
Is energy I can live without
But I could stand you one more night

[Chorus]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah


[Chorus]
I like us better when we're wasted
It makes it easier to say it
Lay all your laundry on the bed
And then I'll lay in it instead
I like us better when we're wasted

Oh woah, woah, woah, woah
Oh woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
You've been so unavailable
Now, sadly, I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Bridge]
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Outro]
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, know
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

My friends had you figured out
Yeah they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake

Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah it's still burning

Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
'Cause I love living innocent

Truth is that I never learned

441,Don't,x (Deluxe Edition),Ed Sheeran,2014-06-21,219840,71,"

[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

[Chorus]
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same (hhh) hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realized what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Chorus]
Don't (hhh)  with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't (hhh) with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

But now they've brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

[Chorus]
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it

Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
You're stoned in paradise
Shouldn't talk about it

Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlled in my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, ""This nigga buggin'""
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along

So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)

[Verse 1]
Take a moment for yourself
Get close with the lights down low
You and I and no one else
I get the feeling that I wanna explode
Baby you grab my attention
Tension burning, fever high
Take me to another dimension
Tonight the rules do not apply

[Hook]
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive

[Verse 2]
This is where I wanna be
Hands up, feel the bass in my heart
Give me faith and I will leap
I take the risk cause you're never too far
Right now I'm drowning in emotion
Caution flies right out the door
Baby you're pushing this devotion
I can only ask for more

[Hook]
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive

When my head is spinning, all hands to the ceiling
I begin to come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know

[Verse 2]
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh

All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

""How the hell did this shit happen?"" Oh baby

Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love

No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights, boy I'm drinking

Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third

Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight
Catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

Dang, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays

And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah, I'ma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when mornin' comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

[Verse 1]
It was a crush
But I couldn't, couldn't get enough
It was a rush
But I gave it up
It was a crush
Now, I might've went and said too much
But, that's all it was
So, I gave it up

Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other

It was a crush
I kept sayin' I'ma stay in touch
But that thing went bust
So I gave it up, ooh
No tricks, no bluff
I'm just better off without them cuffs
Yeah, the sun won't set on us
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah

Went low, went high
Still waters run dry
Gotta get back in the groove
I ain't ever worried
Went low, went high, what matters is now
Gettin' right back in the mood

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer
Doin' it the way I wanna
Yeah, I'ma dance my heart out 'til the dawn
But I won't be done when mornin' comes
Doin' it all night, all summer
Gonna spend it like no other
Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late
Now I've found another crush
The lush life's given me a rush
Had one chance to make me blush
Second time is one too late

Ooh, ooh, woah, ooh, ooh

I live my day as if it was the last
Live my day as if there was no past
Doin' it all night, all summer

Doin' it all night, all summer

She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burn up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, ""Wanna ride out?"", and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed

And I just wanna see that thing drop
From the back to the front to the top
You know me I'm off in the cut
Always like a squirrel, looking for a nut
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck

[Verse 1]
He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be a preacher, when your soul is damned
He could be a lawyer on a witness stand
But he'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humour, but I don't understand
'Cause he'll never love you like I can, can, can

Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
He’ll never love you like I can, can, can

When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands

If you just let me invade your space
I’ll take the pleasure, take it with the pain

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And if in the moment, I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (Lo-love me harder)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time

[Chorus: Ariana Grande, The Weeknd]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (I'ma love you harder, hey!)
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (Love me, baby, love me) (Lo-love me harder)

You got to try, try, try again, yeah (Oh whoa)
So what do I do if I can’t figure it out? (Figure it out)
I’m gonna leave, leave, leave again

Know exactly where it leads, but I

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez]
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

[Pre-Chorus 1: Selena Gomez]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

[Chorus: Selena Gomez with Charli XCX]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

[Pre-Chorus 2: Selena Gomez]
You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

Like a small boat on the ocean
Sending big waves into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now, I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care
If nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got
A lot of fight left in me

[Verse 2]
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep, say I'm in too deep (In too deep)
And it's been two years, I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe

We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me, there's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat

With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I'd rather be

We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
As long as we're together, there's no place I'd rather be

With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart you can't shame me

Hmm, hoo
Be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be
Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah, yeah, yeah

If you gave me a chance, I would take it

[Intro]
What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby

And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you coming home
Girl, I don’t mind

[Verse 1: Usher]
The ballers in here tonight, they gon’ buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon’ make it colossal in here
'Cause shawty you thinkin’ them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

You can twerk while in a split, you racking up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin’, I’m proud to call you my bitch
They be lookin’, but they can’t touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doing what you doing

Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho

[Produced by Hozier and Rob Kirwan]

[Video directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson]

[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice

So come on give me a taste
Of what it’s like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other

521,When We Were Young,25,Adele,2015-11-20,290900,12,"

[Verse 1]
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Verse 2]
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Bridge]
It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?

[Breakdown]
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young

Thinkin', ""How could I be so reckless?""
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

[Verse 3: Kanye West with Rihanna]
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness (Mhm)
Is taken for weakness

Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'

Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone

[Intro]
Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Bridge]
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here

[Verse 1]
Can you feel it? Now it's coming back
We can steal it if we bridge this gap
I can see you through the curtains of the waterfall
When I lost it, yeah, you held my hand
But I tossed it, didn't understand
You were waiting as I dove into the waterfall

[Chorus]
So say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo

[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away
Say Geronimo

[Verse 2]
Well, we rushed it, moving way too fast
That we crushed it, but it's in the past
We can make this leap through the curtains of the waterfall

[Chorus]
So say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo

[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away

[Bridge]
Well, I'm just a boy with a broken toy
All lost and coy at the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand as a broken man
But I've found my friend at the curtains of the waterfall
Now I'm falling down through the crashing sound
And you've come around at the curtains of the waterfall
And you rushed to me and it sets us free
So I fall to my knees at the curtains of the waterfall

[Chorus]
So say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo

[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)
(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)
Bombs away, bombs away
(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)
Bombs away
(Say Geronimo, say Geronimo)

[Outro]
Can you feel my love?

(Make this leap)
(Make this leap)
(Make this leap)
Can you feel my love?

[Verse 1]
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Bridge]
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side

[Outro]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?

Feeling like a digit in a system, just another stupid number
I don't know, know, know
Everything is twisted, I can feel it
It's another stupid summer where it's cold, cold, cold
And we can do it on our own
Head up to a place where baby no one goes
In a rocket full of liquor, in a Polaroid for pictures
Baby you should stop me, 'fore I lose control

Can I realign?
They say it’s easy to leave you behind
I don’t wanna try

Cut cover, take that test
Hold courage to your chest
Don’t wanna wait for you
Don’t wanna have to lose all that I've compromised
To feel another high
I’ve got to keep it down tonight

And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was a king under your control
And, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go
So let me go

Don’t you remember how I used to like being on the line?
I dreamed you dreamed of me calling out my name
Is it worth the price?

Cut cover, take that test
Hold courage to your chest

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad

Hold on, take a minute, love
Cause I ain't trying to fuck your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, fuck the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 1]
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 2]
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

Some turn to dust or to gold

It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down
Next thing that I know I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand

Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait
I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it

Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind

You got yourself in a dangerous zone

Understand it, understand it

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, baby!

Ah, she got cherry lips, angel eyes
She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's out to get you, danger by design
Cold-blooded vixen, she don't compromise

She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
So far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, don't be surprised

Ooh, baby, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feelin' so gifted

Sugar with just the right amount of spice
Charmin', allurin', everyone's desire
She's out to get you – you can't run, you can't hide

She's somethin' mystical in colored lights
I say, so far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, well, baby, don't you be surprised

Yo, he was the realest, I was the baddest, we was the illest

Now it's all eyes on us, and this all lies on trust

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
Uh, fuck, I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you li' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick (brr brr)
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you

Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean + (E-40)]
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)

Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you (Straight up)

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Oh baby, you should go and love yourself

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good

[Verse 2]
Every time that I swear it's over
It makes you want me even more
You pull away and I come in closer
And all we ever stay is torn

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, I don't know why I try to deny it
When you show up every night
I tell you that I want you, but it's complicated, so complicated

[Chorus]
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good

[Bridge]
Wide awake through the daylight
Would you hold me like we're running a yellow light?
Reach for you with my hands tied
Are we dancing like we're burning in paradise?

[Chorus]
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Do you take it? Do you break it off?
When it hurts, but it hurts so good
Can you say it? Can you say it?
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
It hurts so good (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Your love is like- (Hey, na-na-na, na-na)

[Verse 1]
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

[Bridge]
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face

567,Scars To Your Beautiful,Know-It-All (Deluxe),Alessia Cara,2016-03-11,230226,78,"

[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
Like we used to do

[Pre-Chorus 2: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Chorus: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

[Outro: Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez, Both]
We don't talk anymore, oh, oh
(Don't wanna know)

The way I did before
We don't talk anymore, oh, whoa

Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore

Would you walk in? Would you let me do it first?

In the darkness, in the middle of the night
In the silence, when there's no one by your side
Would you call in the name of love?

When there's madness, when there's poison in your head
When the sadness leaves you broken in your bed
I will hold you in the depths of your despair
And it's all in the name of love

[Verse 1]
I thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

[Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Verse 2]
I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
It’s so hard
So hard

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Bridge]
And I know that it’s wrong
That I can’t move on
But there’s something about you

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you

[Verse 1]
I was the knight, the shining armour in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, l-lie I tried to hide
But now you know it

[Chorus]
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Verse 2]
I was the prototype like 3 Stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now, all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

[Pre-Chorus]
I, (I, I) I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, in the light I tried to hide
But now you know it

That I'm at an all time
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Bridge]
I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie and try to hide
But now you know it

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that
I type a text, but thеn I never mind that
I got thesе feelings, but you never mind that
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien & gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

This is gonna hurt, but I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off of that love, my head up
There's no forgetting you

[Pre-Chorus]
You've awoken me, but you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly, I got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously
Mmm, mmm
I loved you dangerously

Usually I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back
Look at how things changed
'Cause now you're the train
And I'm tied to the track

You've awoken me, but you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly, I got nothing left

Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips with goodbye
I see it now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know, there's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire, I'm gasoline

[Breakdown]
I love you, I love you, I love you

I loved you dangerously
Ooh, more than the air that I breathe

Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know

Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go

[Chorus]
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

[Outro]
Hide away, hide away
Hide away, hide away
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Bridge]
Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here

[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more It’s just you and me

[Outro: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It's not us no more

This what happen when I think 'bout you
I get in my feelings, yeah
I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck, I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord, please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my player ways, got way too complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say
That way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so (Yeah)

So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me

[Break 1]
Break it down, yeah
Yes sir
Check

[Verse 2]
We used to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just leveled-up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak, that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man, it's true, exes change, yeah
Ayy, guess you changed for the better (Better!)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby

So give me all of you in exchange for me

For real shawty

Yeah, is you at Two Keys or Tin Roof?
Turn up with young Tiller, we just gettin' loose
Maybe I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
Won’t fuck you over, wanna fuck you over and again
The truth is I ain't really here to start problems
Girl, I swear to God them hoes can't never say they got him
Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, ""don't try him""
I don't wanna tell 'em, let's surprise 'em
I don't wanna get into it – why you stressin' him? I've been drivin'
Back and forth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass in my grip
College make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you
Say what's up with you?
You got my soul

So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair

You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling

I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Verse 2]
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young

Come home early after class
Don't be hanging 'round the back of the schoolyard
I've been called up by your teacher
She said she can't even reach you 'cause you're so far
You've been talking with your fists
We didn't raise you up like this, now did we?
There've been changes in this house
Things you don't know about in this family

It don't make sense, but nevertheless
You gotta believe us, it's all for the best
It don't make sense
The way things go

Sometimes two homes are better than one
Some things you can't tell your sister 'cause she's still too young
Yeah, you'll understand

There ain't no one here to blame
And nothing's going to change with your old friends
Your room will stay the same
'Cause you'll only be away on the weekends

You gotta believe us, it's all for the best

There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

[Chorus]
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

[Verse 2]
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

Oh, it's just me, myself and I
Solo ride until I die
‘Cause I got me for life (Yeah)
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Hun, and as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
‘Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends!
We don't take L's, we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends
I'm right back to work when that break ends, yeah

Except the beat that's in my heart
Yeah, it's keepin' me alive (Keeps me alive)
I don't need anything to make me satisfied (You know)
‘Cause the music does me good
And it gets me every time

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, and I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go apeshit
Say ""Fuck y'all!"" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy
They all take the money for granted
But don't want to work for it—tell me now, isn't it funny? (Nah)

Yeah, lonely nights I laid awake
Pray to Lord my soul to take
My heart's become too cold to break
Know I'm great, but I'm broke as hell
Havin' dreams that I'm foldin' cake
All my life I've been told to wait
But I'ma get it now, yeah, it's no debate

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

[Verse 1]
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus]
Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

[Verse 3]
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

[Chorus]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?

Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

As they floated in the breeze
They were falling in slow motion
And they brought me to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn off the light and now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you

[Chorus]
Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
And I'll get over you
These tears will get me through
And I'll get over you

[Post-Chorus]
I'll, I'll, I'll get over you
I'll, I'll, ooh, yeah
I'll, I'll, I'll get over you
I'll, I'll, I'll get over you

[Verse 2]
When did you lose your emotion?
When did you become so cruel?
And if you want to cut me open
Says a thousand words 'bout you
And in time I know you'll leave me
Like a distant memory
I know love can be so easy
If I start by loving me, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn off the light and now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you
Woah-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down

[Post-Chorus]
I'll get over you
I'll get over you

[Chorus]
Tears on the ground, rain at my window
The pain washes out
And I'll get over you
These tears will get me through
And I'll get over you

[Bridge]
I'll get over you
I don't need you to call me tonight
I don't need you to see if I'm alright
You left me, so leave me, I'm fine
I'll be here getting on with my life

[Chorus]
Tears on the ground
Rain at my window, the pain washes out
And I'll get over you, and I'll get over you
I'll get over you

I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound

I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh, baby, won't you cum again?
She said ""I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering""

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said ""I love you""
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it, but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you do

And I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

[Verse 2]
It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe
And there's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
Oh, and you say (You say) I'm such a cliché
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said ""I love you""
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you do

[Chorus]
I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

[Outro]
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on, ayy, ayy
I'm beyond all that fuck shit, hey

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on (what I'm on)
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
Real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

[Chorus: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch, get off me (goddamn)
In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli (goddamn)
Yeh, I know your baby mama fond of me (goddamn)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli (goddamn)
Whispered in my ear, she tryna leave with me (goddamn)
Tell her I can get that pussy easily (goddamn)
Tell her I can hit that shit so greasily (goddamn)
I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily (damn)

Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on, ayy, ayy

Said I'm beyond all that fuck shit, ayy

[Verse 2: D.R.A.M.]
I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

[Chorus: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch, get off me (off me)
In the cut, I'm rollin' up my broccoli
(my weed, my weed)
Yeah, I know your baby mama fond of me (she fond of me)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
(the weed, the weed)
Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
(she runnin' for)
Said that I can get that pussy easily
(she fallin' for)
Said I can hit that shit so greasily (oh yeah, oh yeah)
I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily (yeah)

[Chorus]
All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You’ll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You’ll never know  the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

[Verse 2]
We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You'll never know the freak show sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think ""How did I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it, watch it)

All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves

All my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know (Watch it)
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know

[Outro]
Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed (It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away (Wouldn't listen to me)
And now they're outside ready to bust (And guess what?)
It looks like you might be one of us

[Intro]
Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, um (Woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

[Chorus]
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Verse 2]
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the rooves
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

[Chorus]
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

[Outro: Frank Ocean & Beyoncé]
Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out of melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality

[Chorus]
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

[Verse 1]
Mama, come here
Approach, appear
And Daddy, I'm alone
'Cause this house don't feel like home

If you love me, don't let go (Hold) Woah
If you love me, don't let go (Hold)

Hold, hold on, hold on to me

That you're tired of being alone
Dad, I know you're trying
To fight when you feel like flying

[Refrain]
If you love me, don't let go (Hold) Woah
If you love me, don't let go (Hold)

[Chorus]
Hold, hold on, hold on to me
'Cause I'm a little unsteady, a little unsteady

[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a ""Yes, sir,"" not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

[Verse 2]
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

[Bridge]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)

[Outro]
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

[Letra de ""Despacito (Remix)"" ft. Justin Bieber]

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Comin' over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Verso 2: Daddy Yankee]
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber, Daddy Yankee]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Puente: Luis Fonsi]
Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
I can move forever cuando esté contigo
¡Báilalo!

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee, Luis Fonsi & Justin Bieber]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (D.Y.)

[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Halsey]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner

Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Comin' for the king, that's a far cry, I
I come alive in the fall time, I
The competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne, bumpin' New Edition

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearing aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don’t see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Look what you've done
I’m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin’ starboy

[Verse 3]
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah

Switch up my style, I take any lane

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Building my rain up in the cloud

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

[Chorus]
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

[Verse 2]
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can

Tell me why are we wasting time

Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying

658,Scars To Your Beautiful,Know-It-All (Deluxe),Alessia Cara,2016-03-11,230226,78,"

[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Ever since you came around, can’t nobody hold me down
You showed me how to find myself when I needed it the most

I’m never gonna find my way
If I don’t run to that goal
The past is the past, today is today
And there’s things I can’t control
The circles underneath my eyes
Tell the truth that I've been trying to hide
I’ve been waiting for you way too long
Won’t you come and take me home

Can you, you, wake me up before you leave

You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed

But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Bridge]
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Outro]
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go

Driving a nightmare I can't escape from

[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

[Break: Andrew Taggart]
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart]
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

[Bridge: Emily Warren & Andrew Taggart]
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are
Show them we are
Let's show them we are better

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
We were staying in Paris (If we go down)
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris

[Verse 1]
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

[Pre-Chrous]
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

[Chorus]
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Verse 2]
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

[Chorus 2]
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

[Outro]
‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you

Where should we run to?
We got the world in our hands and we're ready to play
They say we're wasted
But how can we waste it if we're loving every day?
Okay, I got the keys to the universe
So stay, with me, 'cause I got the keys, babe

Don't wanna wake up one day wishing that we'd done more

Alright, 'cause we got the keys to the universe

Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?

[Drop: Selena Gomez & Kygo]
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful

It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez]
I had a dream
We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and The Libertines
Never growing up

[Pre-Chorus: Selena Gomez]
I'll take with me
The polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave
Behind the worst of us

[Chorus: Selena Gomez]
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?

[Drop: Selena Gomez & Kygo]
It ain't me, no no
It ain't me, no no
It ain't me, no no
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

[Verse 1]
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

[Verse 2]
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

[Chorus]
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Verse 3]
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

[Chorus]
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?

I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me like novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever

Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song

And she looks perfect

You look perfect tonight

[Verse 1]
Our love was strong as a lion
Soft as the cotton you lie in
Times we got hot like an iron
You and I
Our hearts had never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk 'til the morning
You and I

[Pre-Chorus]
We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating, had it repeating

[Chorus]
You were my September Song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen
You were my September Song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station
Passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers
You and I

[Pre-Chorus]
Still, I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating, got it repeating

[Chorus]
You were my September song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
I hear that September song, that I'm singing along
Thinking about you and me, oh, what a melody

[Bridge]
And as the years go by
You will still be my, be my (September song)
You are my (September song)

[Chorus]
You were my September song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song
I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us

""No thank you"" is what I should've said
I should be in bed
But temptations of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come

One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And ""no thank you"" is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that

701,Castle on the Hill,÷ (Deluxe),Ed Sheeran,2017-03-03,261153,77,"

[Verse 1]
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

[Pre-Chorus]
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu

I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

And the more I drink, the more I think about you
Oh, no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you

Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

I don't wanna know, know, know, know

And every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see, but don't believe it
Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

No more ""please, stop""
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' to make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this? Do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
You know I'm back, like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in (Been going in)
Since we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things, they don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like ""Woo, that boy got bars""
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came, woo

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)
We gon' be alright, put that on my life
When I open my eyes, hope I see you shine
We're planting a flag, they don't understand
The world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?

YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents

Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over

It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out

I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna

We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Verse 2]
We are problems that want to be solved
We are children that need to be loved
We were willin', we came when you called
But man, you fooled us, enough is enough, oh

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

[Bridge]
Sticks and stones, they may break these bones
But then I'll be ready, are you ready?
It's the start of us, waking up, come on
Are you ready? I'll be ready
I don't want control, I want to let go
Are you ready? I'll be ready
'Cause now it's time to let them know
We are ready, what about us?

[Chorus]
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
So what about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?

[Letra de ""Despacito (Remix)"" ft. Justin Bieber]

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Comin' over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Verso 2: Daddy Yankee]
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber, Daddy Yankee]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

Sube, sube)

Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
I can move forever cuando esté contigo
¡Báilalo!

It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle

My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time (Oh)
Before the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined (Oh)
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time (Oh)

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

Nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, and she tipsy

I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like GoGo, hey
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone (Ooh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Burnin' all those candles and stayin' up through the night
We'd make reservations for the places we know we'd never try
But then oh, we found some rich love

I didn't move to the city to count all my pennies
And worship the Hollywood sign
She'll say, ""Hey man, nice to meet you,""
And she'll take every one last time
And I know, 'cause I found some fake love

Ooh, but drink with you all damn night

I don't see anybody else, no
When we fight, and you're right
So sorry, I make it just so difficult

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I'm not just a fuck-up, I'm the fuck-up you love
We ain't like nobody else, tell me so what
Perfectly imperfect, yeah, baby, that's us
Baby, that's us
'Cause I know that you've been thinking 'bout it

Don't leave
Shut your mind off and let your heart breathe
You don't need to be worried
I may not ever get my shit together
But ain't nobody gonna love you better
Don't go
What we have here is irreplaceable
No, I won't trade this for nothing
I may not ever get my shit together
But ain't nobody gonna love you better

[Bridge]
Sitting in the living room
You look at me, I stare at you
I see the doubt, I see the love
I have and it is all for you
Let me wrap myself around you, baby
Let me tell you you are everything, you are
Losing my words, I don't know where to start
But baby, don't leave me
Shut your mind off and let your heart hear me
I won't trade this for nothing
I may not ever get my shit together
But ain't nobody gonna love you better

Don't leave
Shut your mind off and let your heart breathe
You don't need to be worried
I may not ever get my shit together
But ain't nobody gonna love you better

[Verso 1: J Balvin]
Si el ritmo te lleva a mover la cabeza
Ya empezamos como es
Mi música no discrimina a nadie
Así que vamos a romper
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo cómo los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
El mundo nos quiere, nos quiere
Me quiere a mí
Toda mi gente se mueve
Mira el ritmo cómo los tiene
Hago música que entretiene
Mi música los tiene fuerte bailando
Y se baila así

Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on

And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Outro]
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me

Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave

Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart

Maybe the world could be ours

We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Bridge: Halsey & Khalid]
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now

[Outro: Halsey & Khalid]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set

[Verse 1]
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

[Verse 2]
We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('Cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

[Pre-Chorus]
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

[Bridge]
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

[Chorus]
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

[Post-Chorus]
I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1: Bastille]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus: Bastille]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus: Bastille]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2: Bastille]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus: Bastille]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but

You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me

I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with

It's getting cold when an ego gets to talkin'
I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no, I'm switched in the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, you didn't wait from me
Leave me alone, keep away from me
And it sounds wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just think for the life, for the days
For the hours and another like breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter (Fighter)
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort, oh
And all this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence

I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long

Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence

I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying

Coulda made this work

Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen

No, but at least you're happy

You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Verse 2]
I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

[Chorus]
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

[Bridge]
No
No, no, no, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)

We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

[Chorus]
So call out my name (Call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (Want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—

I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe

Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said ""be true,"" I swear I'll try

He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I, him and I

[Verse 1: G-Eazy & Halsey]
My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince (You know?)

Cross my heart, hope to die (Uh)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy & Halsey]
We turn up, mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I-
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever
You know?
We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?

Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie

Cross my heart, hope to die
To you, I've never lied
For you, I'd take a life
It's him and I, and I swear (Ayy)
'Til the end I'ma ride wit' you
Mob and get money, get high wit' you, yeah (Ayy)
Cross my heart, hope to die
This is our ride or die
You can confide in me
There's not no hiding, I swear
Stay solid, never lie to you
Swear, most likely I'ma die wit' you, yeah

Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said, “Be true,” I swear I'll try

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

[Chorus]
And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away

I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now

[Verse 2]
You weren't a fan of pictures
So I hardly ever took 'em
Got them saved in my mind from the bedroom
So that way I can't forget your skin
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know we're not supposed to talk
But I'm getting ahead of myself
I get scared when we're not
'Cause I'm scared you're with somebody else
So, I guess that it's gone
And I just keep lying to myself
Oh, I can't believe it, I-

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now

[Bridge]
So I saved all the texts
All of the best over the years
Just to remind myself of how good it is
Yeah, I saved all the texts off of my ex
Minus the tears
Just to remind myself of how good it is, or was
'Cause I-

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
I miss you, yeah, I miss you, oh, I do
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now
I can't help it, I just
Though I’m tryin’ not to right now
I can't help it, I just

And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it

[Verse 1]
Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

[Verse 2]
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about it when I'm riding through

[Pre-Chorus]
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
You need a pick me up?
I'll be there in twenty-five
I like to push my luck
So take my hand, let's take a drive
I've been livin' in the future
Hopin' I might see you sooner
I want you riding shotgun
I knew when I got one right

[Chorus]
Let's fall in love for the night
And forget in the mornin'
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line
I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
I know better than to call you mine

[Verse 2]
I love it when you talk that nerdy shit
We're in our twenties talking thirties shit
We're making money but we're savin' it
'Cause talking shit is cheap and we talk a lot of it
You won't stay with me, I know
But you can have your way with me 'til you go
And before your kisses turn into bruises, I'm a warning

[Chorus]
Let's fall in love for the night
And forget in the mornin'
Play me a song that you like
You can bet I'll know every line
'Cause I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
I know better, I know better
I know better than to ever call you mine

[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, ""Shit, this is it,"" ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like ""Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, ""Can I have some to hold?""
And I can't ever tell you no

The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael

It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose

I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrive in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move

Slide on it pimp game with my pinky ring

Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift a hand
Three million cash, call me Rain Man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland

Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a ""Yes, sir,"" not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

[Verse 1]
It's like thunder and lightning
You hurt me without trying
A tempestuous rising
And no, I don't like to be this way
And you're Jekyll and Hydein'
Are you real, are you lying?
So stop with your crying
I can't handle it now

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell everyone our love went cold
Going 'round, spreading the word, it's over
If that's how you feel, then you should go
Don't come around saying, ""I still want ya""

[Chorus]
One minute, you say we're a team
Then you're telling me you can't breathe
Well, you should set me free
Baby, if you're over me
Yesterday you said I'm the one
But now you say you're done
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me

[Verse 2]
There you go, there, I said it
Don't look at me all offended
You played games 'til it ended
I've got to look out for me
I won't say that it's easy
Oh, I know I hate leaving
But you can't keep deceiving
Does it make you feel good?

[Pre-Chorus]
You tell everyone our love went cold
Going 'round, spreading the word, it's over
If that's how you feel, then you should go
Don't come around saying, ""I still want ya""

[Chorus]
One minute, you say we're a team
Then you're telling me you can't breathe
Well, you should set me free
Baby, if you're over me
Yesterday you said I'm the one
But now you say you're done
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me
If you're over me
If you're over me
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me

[Bridge]
How long can a love remain?
Time never could heal this pain
I thought I believed in fate
Oh, it's so cruel
No, nothing for us would change
Same story, the same mistakes
This heart just had to break'
Oh whoa

[Chorus]
One minute, you say we're a team
Then you're telling me you can't breathe (can't breathe)
Well, you should set me free
Baby, if you're over me
Yesterday you said I'm the one (said I'm the one)
But now you say you're done (oh)
Stop telling me what I need (stop telling me what I need)
Baby, if you're over me

[Outro]
Just go if it's over (just go)
Just go if it's over (just go if it's over)
Just go if it's over
Baby, if you're over me
Just go if it's over (just go)
Just go if it's over (just go if it's over)
Just go if it's over

[Verse 1]
Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

[Verse 2]
And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly but you need some imagination

[Chorus]
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

[Bridge]
I can't stop sweating or control my feet
Got a 20-stone monkey that I just can't beat
I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
And there's a feeling, you're replacing embrace

[Chorus]
It's true that all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

[Outro]
Oh, I'll try to get a job in a bank, I think
Danny spent the time trying to pack in the drinks for me
I feel sick and I know I that I'll lose but
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not, it's not)
(It's not, it's not)
It's not living if it's not with you
(It's not living if it's not with you)

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

[Verse 1: Lettie Lutz]
I am not a stranger to the dark
""Hideaway,"" they say
""'Cause we don't want your broken parts""
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
""Runaway,"" they say
""No one'll love you as you are""

[Pre-Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
But I won't let them break me down to dust
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious

[Chorus: Lettie Lutz]
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
I am brave, I am bruised
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me

[Post-Chorus: Ensemble]
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Lettie Lutz, Ensemble]
Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the barricades
And reaching for the sun
(We are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become
(Yeah, that's what we've become)

[Verse 1]
The way your fingers fit in mine
It's five plus five, not rocket science
This day in time, that's hard to find, it's true
The road we're on ain't a traffic jam
It's a Sunday drive on a piece of land
It's paradise as long as I'm with you

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

[Verse 2]
We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

[Chorus]
It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me
You make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin', love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

Ain't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style, yeah

Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E

Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me

Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role

She'll pity the men I know

Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Verse 2]
I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Bridge]
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again

[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go

[Intro: Khalid]
Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my

You prolly think that you are better now, better now

Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now

Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

[Verse 1]
I've cheated and I’ve lied
I've broke down and I've cried
I’ve got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
Broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Known to be crazy, known to be wild
Mama had herself a little devilish child
Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door

[Chorus]
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls' mamas don’t like
Runnin’ with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I’ve been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

[Post-Chorus]
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Mmm
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Yeah, I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right

[Verse 2]
You saw right through my pain
Kept us patient while I changed
Never even crossed your mind to walk away (To walk away)

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was gettin' crazy, reckless, and wild
Actin' like my mama's little devilish child
It took a heart like yours to find its place (Find its place)

[Chorus]
I’ve been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over
Well, there must be something in the tide

Looking for one wish, on a Ray J ting

But she can’t see 'cause I got shades and ting
Bare girls wanna throw shade and ting
No shade, what shade is your foundation in?
Darkest grey, the shade I'm in

Girls wanna chase, it's a status ting

Look, money like the alphabet
If you wanna see P’s, gotta pass on the ends
Came a long way from a park in the bends
To an '18 plate, man’s parking a Benz
Far from the rest but I'm far from my best
Life is a lesson, I'm passing a test
Yes, everyting blessed
I don't want drama and I don’t want stress
My girl got finesse, Caribbean flex
Body and chest, take buddy in chest
Thank God more, I grew up with less
Juss to the right, Rapz to the left
Rj in the middle, got Cee to the death
Batch full of dogs with the 60's vets

And nothing breaks like a heart

I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it

We got all night to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken

Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
We'll leave each other cold as ice
And high and dry, the desert wind
Is blowin', is blowin'
Remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it

Mmm, that nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now

(¡Da-ddy Yan-kee!)
Tú me ganaste
Me metiste en tu juego y me dañaste
El ticket semanal puede ser que en ti lo gaste
Me creo bichote tirando lo' peso' (-so')
Por 'tar ricota te doy pata' y queso
Sino peleemos, nunca regreso y por eso (¡Rrr!)
Yo me quiero ir pa' casa, pero tú no me dejas (Oh, oh, oh)
Ese culo e' una amenaza, ya me creo que ere' mi pareja (Let's go!)
Un shot (Ey), dos shot' (Ey), empezó el problema
Porque el alcohol se metió en mi sistema (Prr)
Quien vaya chotear ya lleva la querella
No me eche' la culpa, cúlpenla a ella (¡Fuego!)

[Verso 4: KAROL G]
Contigo me enredé (Me enredé)
Y con un par de tragos, baby, me solté (Me solté)
Me quedé contigo y no le contesté
No sé por qué fallé (Yeh, yeh)
Pero sí sé que rico la pasé (Ah)
Llegó la media noche (Noche)
Apena' empezaba el toque (Toque)
Es que mi novio me esperaba (Ah, ah)
Antes que fueran las doce (Doce)
Qué bien la pasamo' anoche (-noche)
Sé que fallé y que me perdone (Eh, eh)
Y si lo vuelvo a ver mañana (Ah)
Diré que no me conoce

[Verso 5: J Balvin]
J Balvin, man
Yo estaba en la disco perreando
Cuando con ella me envolví, sí (Wuh, wuh)
Mi mujer me estaba llamando
Y tuve que darle delete, y (Auch)
Y yo que no me dejo envolver (Wuh)
Villana, tú me hiciste caer
Ese booty que hasta un ciego puede ver
Y hasta el más santo quiere ser infiel (Leggo; yeh, yeh)

[Refrán: J Balvin & Daddy Yankee]
Cambiamos de escena (Ey)
De R.D. hasta Cartagena
Ere' la única que me llena
Si te cogió, pago mi condena, nena
Cambiamos de escena
De R.D. hasta Cartagena (Come on, come on)
Ere' la única que me llena (Leggo)
Si te cogió, pago mi condena, yeh (¡Fuimo'!)

[Coro: Daddy Yankee, Anuel AA, Ozuna & Karol G]
Mi mujer me estaba llamando
Pero yo no contesté (Uah, baby; sube)
Porque yo estaba contigo perreando
Y de ella me olvidé (Mami)
Dios mío, perdóname
No sé por qué yo le falle (Fallé; uah)
Yo estaba en la disco perreando
Y con ella me enredé
(Woh, oh, oh; ¡fuego!; uah; bebecita, bebecita)

[Post-Coro: Anuel AA, Daddy Yankee & Ozuna]
Yo estaba en la disco perreando (Oh, oh; hah, ¡prr!)
Yo estaba en la disco perreando (Eh, eh, eh; uah)
Yo estaba en la disco perreando

900,Take Me Back to London (feat. Stormzy),No.6 Collaborations Project,Ed Sheeran,2019-07-12,189733,69,"

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)

[Verse 1: Stormzy]
I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, ""Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown""
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London

[Verse 3: Stormzy & Ed Sheeran]
Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, ""That's just the way things go""
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Stormzy]
Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Getting high)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)
So take me back to London
So take me back to London

Tell me what you want
I know it's a lie (Lie)
You broke my heart
And you cannot fix that

But certainly, all you do is burden me
It's hurting deep
Our past is like a blur to me
It's hard to see, but look what you have done to me

Manna big man, twenty racks on tax
Very sexy, yelly, Steffy (Bullet)
Baby shake up your bum-bum (Shake it)
Don't have sex without condoms (Nah)
Cali spliff looking Hong Kong (Loud)
I don't pipe your girl-, that's my don-don
Very selective, selected corn, eject it
The way he ran off, he meant it (Gone)

[Verse 2: Aitch]
Yo, both hands on the back when I tap it, grab it and slap it, Becky a savage
Lemme show you a magic trick, you can have this dick after that man vanish
Two MILFs in a whip, bro-bro said he wanted a bit, told him he can manage
This baby face an advantage, man still show a big girl what a man is
Give her my screw face, she caught me staring, what do you expect when your skirt's so short?
Out here twerking, gone past caring, she went out cheating, the girl got caught
Stepped in the place all shiny, I don't have a chain, man glow when I walk
Don't phone if you're wasting my time, got me changing my line 'cause I don't wanna talk

[Chorus: Tion Wayne & Russ]
Pull up, pull up and dump off, dump off
Twist up your waist and jump off, jump off
Free up, free up that number

[Verse 3: JAY1]
How many L's did I take this year? And how many times did I buck your chicky?
Had a cap on my head like 50 when I gave wood to your girl, that's dicky
And I didn't wanna holla at Becky, so I went Brighton and holla'd at Britney
And how many chicks did I swipe? Top of my head, I think about fifty
And I don't really wanna hear nonsense
Man send one text to your female, now the bad B come looking like custard
Slim t'ic with the back come detail, give her back shot, two-two, now she loved it
And the ting come quick like a e-mail, mate well done, got brain and he cuffed it
JAY bun up the place like a moshpit, viral, now I got fans in Boston
Two stepped to the dance all saucy, one gun lean, man did it like Russ did
And everybody wanna link Keisha, Becky, ease up, likkle man stop it
Bad B from kway called Lisa, shit den, wanna take wood cah I'm poppin'

[Verse 4: Tion Wayne]
Everyday I give thanks for the blessings but I repent for numerous cheffings
If you saw the way that I kweffed him, man I weren't shocked that his bredrin left him
Bet they thought the last verse was a fluke ting, free my broski inside for some bootings
Man, I'm boasy, spend racks on a Cuban and my lightskin, brownskin or cute tings
Man I love to go west, spend figures, then I go home, eat bariis and hilib
African girl arch back, I wan' 'it-it, pounded yam with okra or spinach

All these man wan' talk 'bout drill, they do drill rap but ain't got no heart
All the things man seen and done in the field, nigga you won't know the half
And bro told me he just done that bait, so now he's in a petrol bath
Bro backed it, I told him dump off, dump off, before I back it, they run off
Hit that once, you can't be my lover, HMP, free up my brother
Ambush I got my block jumpy, jumpy, gyal on me, man they love me
Two gyal, who's holding this brucky? Oh my god, look at that bumsy

[Verse 6: Swarmz]
(Nine-nine-nine)
See my guy got bagged for the chinging, the grind don't stop so we see this dough
I told bro just slap it in reverse with a petrol can and burn them clothes
A9 got caught with the grub, oh my, so he's looking like two do one
And I pray on my life that they ride in front the jakes so the whole tings done
Big up my chocolate darling, true say that she lost the plot
Doing up-Doing up Gucci gang with her nails on fleek as she whips that pot
My bro just reading the amm, take that to the OT spot
Like we was fifteen when we had the whole 9 block like Wizard of Oz
See, back the beef, you get got g

Bend it over, push it on me then rotate your hips (woo!)
When we fucked she let me take a pic
One chance, are you leaving or are you taking it?
I got some white chocolate, I promise you'll like the taste of it

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Verse 1]
I could've showed you all the scars at the start
But that was always the most difficult part
See, I'm in love with how your soul's a mix of chaos and art
And how you never try to keep 'em apart (Yeah)
I wrote some words and then I stared at my feet
Became a coward when I needed to speak
I guess love took on a different kind of meaning for me
So when I go, just know it kills me to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Verse 2]
But there's beauty here that's yet to depart
There's still a song inside the halls in the dark (Halls in the dark)
I'll come for you if you just stay where you are
And I'll always hold your hand in the car (Hand in the car)
There'll be days when it's difficult
But I ask you to never leave behind the reciprocal, we're past that
Love is not designed for the cynical
So we have that (We have that)
We can have that

[Pre-Chorus]
To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Bridge]
How long can you wait for the one you deserve?
Fight on, never let it out, never let it out
If I'm gone, if you ever leave I hope that you learn
To fight on, to fight on

[Chorus]
Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

[Outro]
(How long?)
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
(How long?)
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere, somewhere

Almost gave it away
Would you hear me out if I told you I was terrified for days?
Thought I was gonna break

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I couldn't stop it
Tried to slow it all down
Crying in the bathroom
Had to figure it out
With everyone around me saying
""You must be so happy now""

Oh, if you keep reaching out
Then I'll keep coming back
And if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
If you leave the light on

There's just no other way
That I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
