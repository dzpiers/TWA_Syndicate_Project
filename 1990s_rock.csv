Thunder, ah

Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah

Thunder, ah
Thunder, ah

[Verse 1]
I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck

[Verse 2]
Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Oh, thunderstruck
Yeah

[Bridge 1]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yow

Thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah
Said

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine
Yeah, it's alright
We're doing fine, so fine

Thunderstruck, thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Whoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck, thunderstruck

[Intro]
(Whistling)

[Verse 1]
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
(Whistling)

[Verse 2]
The world is closing in
And did you ever think?
That we could be so close?
Like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

[Chorus]
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change
(mmmmmmm)

[Verse 3]
Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

[Chorus]
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (you and me)
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change (wind of change)

[Bridge]
The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to sing (sing)

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (you and me)
Take me (take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (a glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (dream away)
In the wind of change (wind of change)

Yeah, make some noise

[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am, a man on the scene
I give you what you want, got you comin' home with me
Got all my love, little more in store
Get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things that come by the dozen, did you know?

Action speaks louder than words, man of experience
Got you another man, I can love you better than him
Man, don't be afraid, prove every word I say
Advertising love for free, place your ad with me

[Verse 1: Gary Cherone]
Saying ""I love you""
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

[Chorus]
What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying, ""I love you""

Da-de-da-la-de-da
La-de-dei-dei-dei
More than words
Da-de-da-la-de-da

[Verse 2: Gary Cherone]
Now that I've tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close, don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do if my heart was torn in two?

Don't you know what you're doing?
You've got a death wish

[Yeah?]

Suicide blonde, suicide blonde

Suicide blonde was the colour of her hair
Like a cheap distraction
For a new affair
She knew it would finish
Before it began
Woah baby, you lost the plan

You want to make her

You want to make her

Such a squeeze
A mad, sad moment
Glory to you, glory to you, take me there

Oooo, take me there

Got some revelation put into your hands
Save you from your misery

Turning your world around again

Tailored suits, chauffeured cars
Fine hotels and big cigars
Up for grabs, all for a price
Where the red hot girls keep on dancing through the night

[Pre-Chorus]
The claim is on you, the sights are on me
So what do you do that's guaranteed?
Hey little girl, you want it all
The furs, the diamonds
The paintings on the wall

Come on, come on, lovin' for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk
Come on, come on, lovin' for the money
Come on, come on, listen to the money talk

A French maid, foreign chef
A big house, with king-size beds
You had enough, you ship them out
The dollar's up, down, you better buy the Pound

So what do you do that's guaranteed?

6,While My Guitar Gently Weeps,Hell To Pay,The Jeff Healey Band,1990-05-21,315666,54,"

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
From every mistake, we must surely be learning
And still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted, too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

7,All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You,Brigade,Heart,1990-03-25,310893,66,"

It was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said, ""Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can""

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too

All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew

[Intro]
Oooh yeah wooh!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
Life´s ambition occupy my time
Priorities confuse the mind
Happiness one step behind
This inner peace I've yet to find

[Pre-Chorus]
Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I´m not blind why can't I see
That a circle can´t fit where a square should be?

[Chorus]
There´s a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can´t be filled with the things I do
Hole hearted
Hole hearted

[Verse 2]
This heart of stone is where I hide
These feet of clay keep warm inside
Day by day less satisfied
Not fade away before I die

[Pre-Chorus]
Rivers flow into the sea
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
If I´m not blind why can´t I see
Ooh, that a circle can´t fit where a square should be?

[Chorus]
There´s a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
And this hole in my heart
Can´t be filled with the things I do

[Chorus 2]
There´s a hole in my heart
That can only be filled by you
Should have known from the start
I´d fall short with the things I do
Hole hearted,  hole hearted
Hole hearted,  hole hearted

Used to be so easy
To give my heart away
But I found out the hard way
There's a price you have to pay

I found out that love
Was no friend of mine
I should have known
Time after time

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

Used to be so easy
To fall in love again
But I found out the hard way
It's a road that leads to pain
I found out that love
Was more than just a game
Playing to win
But you lose just the same

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

So many years since I've seen your face
But here in my heart there's an empty space
Where you used to be

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

Though the days come and go
There is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you

12,Miracle,Blaze Of Glory,Jon Bon Jovi,1990-01-01,319426,54,"

A penny for your thoughts now baby
Looks like the weight of the world's
On your shoulders now

I know you think you're going crazy
Just when it seems everything's
Gonna work itself out
They drive you right back down

And you said it ain't fair
That a man walks
When a bird can fly
We have to kick the ground
The stars kiss the sky
They say that spirits live
A man has to die
They promised us truth
Now they're giving us lies

Gonna take a miracle to save us this time
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle
'Cause it's all on the line
And I won't let you down
(No I won't let you down)
The river of your hope is flooding
And I know the dam is busted
If you need me I'll come running
I won't let you down... no, no

You're looking for salvation
You thought that it'd be shining
Like an angel's light
Well, the angels left this nation
And salvation caught the last train
Out tonight
He lost one hell of a fight

He said
I'm just one man, that's all I'll ever be
I never can be everything you wanted from me
I've got plans so big
That any blind man could see
I'm standing in the river
Now I'm drowning in the sea

Gonna take a miracle to save us this time
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle
'Cause your heart's on the line
And your heartbeat is slowing down
Your feet are grounded still
You're reaching for the sky
You can let 'em clip your wings
'Cause I believe that you can fly

Well my eyes have seen the horror
Of the coming of the flood
I've driven deep the thorny crown
Into the soul of someone's son
Still I'll look you in the eye
'Cause I've believed in things I've thought
And I'll die without regret
For the wars I have fought

Gonna take a miracle to save you this time
And your savior has just left town
Gonna need a miracle
'Cause your heart's doing time
And your conscience is calling you out
It ain't all for nothing
Life ain't written in the sand
I know the tide is coming
But it's time we made a stand
With a miracle

With a flickering torch
I had a dream that no one else could see

Hearts of fire
Streets of stone
Modern warriors
Saddle iron horses of chrome

Taste the wild
Lick the wind
Like something they never saw before
Their jaws dropping to the floor
Steel made of soul and sin

Rebels born without a care
And the day he listens
Only to fly where eagles dare
And the night she whispers

Chorus:
Ride the wind
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun
Ride the wind
Never coming back again
Ride the wind
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun

Painted flesh
Loyalty
Humble pride
Just as far as the eye can see

Stories told
Two old friends
Of battle scars and lonely bars
And nights the rain wouldn't end

Here's to withered eyes wearing gypsy smiles
And the day he listens
Here's to lovely ladies and a million miles
And the night she whispers

Chorus

Ride the wind
I'm still the bravest soul in sin
Burning till the night is done

Solo

Of all the truths and lies
And stories of riders in the sky
They say only the bravest try
Where eagles and angels dare to fly

I pulled them down for you, just when I fell in love again
You said that all good things must end

Baby, that's just the way it is baby
Baby, that's just the way it is baby

I've never had a hand for solitaire
It's so unfair
That I should have my chance and lose
I feel like I've been used to help you through another night
You spelled it out in black and white

The tides that once had carried you away
They bring you back today
The time has washed away my pain
I find that things have changed and disappeared without a trace
You can't get back what you've erased
And I say

Smellin' like a rose

Twice as hard

Twice as hard (One time, baby, two time)
First time, I said goodbye

Are you the one to tell me I'm blind?

Come crashing in into my little world

21,Something To Believe In - Remastered,Flesh & Blood,Poison,1990,328360,56,"

Good girls go to heaven
Bad girls go to hell
The rest of them get rich
And do just what they feel

Well rich boys live in houses
And poor boys live in sin
The rest of them get married
And are never seen again

Well let me tell a story explain the shape I'm in
The girl I had last night had never tasted sin
So I took her to my hotel where I tried to get my way
She said ""Wait a minute, Bret, there's something I must say...""

She said 'If you wanna talk that's fine with me
But if you want more you'd better let me be'

Cause you can look but you can't touch
Cause the best things in life ain't cheap
You can look but you can't touch
Cause baby I ain't for keeps

Well maybe I'm a bad boy
Ok, so I've been around the block
But I am good at one thing
And believe me it ain't talk

She says ""You must be kidding
I've heard this all before
Other girls might buy it
But I don't, that's for sure""

Now wait a minute baby
I don't want you to go
She said ""Don't get no closer
The answer still is no""

So I wined her, dined her, fancy talked
Acted cool and smooth
Got my hands around her shoulder
Two inches from the move

Well I guess I'm about as close as I could be
So I finally made my move, she just said to me

Cause you can look but you can't touch
Cause the best things in life ain't cheap
You can look but you can't touch
Cause baby I ain't for keeps

Let me show you something
Mmm, let me set the pace
Slid my hand up her leg
As she slapped me across my face

Can't blame a man for tryin'
Wantin' action ain't a crime
I didn't plan on spending money
Just to get a piece of mind

Solo

So I started really thinkin'
And I got myself a plan
I opened up a cold beer
And I handed her the can

She drank it down real fast until she nearly choked
Jumped up on my bed, tore off all her clothes and said

Cause you can look but you can't touch
Cause the best things in life ain't cheap
You can look but you can't touch
Cause baby I ain't for keeps

You can look (look), but don't touch, no!
You can look (look), but don't touch, no!
You can look (look), but don't touch, no!
You can look (look), but don't touch, no!

Pain and suffering

Never will ignore

All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

Say you're mine
And give yourself to the
Feelings that you know
I'm needing
All that you can give me
All the things
That you do so well

Sweet anticipation
Making spells
As the shadows close in
Fall across all our yesterdays

They say that no man is an island
And good things come to those who wait
But the things i hear are just there to remind me
Every dog will have his day

The spirits they intoxicate me
I watched them infiltrate my soul
They try to say, it's too late for me
Tell my guns I'm coming home

I swear, I'm gonna live forever
Tell my maker he can wait
I'm riding somewhere south of heaven
I'm heading back to Santa Fe
It's judgement day in Santa Fe

Once I was promised absolution
There's only one solution for my sins
You gotta face your ghost, and know with no illusion
That only one of you is going home again

And I blame this world, for making a good man evil
It's this world, that can drive a good man mad
And it's this world that turns a killer into a hero
Well I blame this world for making a good man bad

Now I ain't getting into heaven
If the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Heading back to Santa Fe
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
It's Judgement day in Santa Fe
Oh lord have mercy

""Guitar solo""

So I save the prayer when I need it most
To the father, the son and the holy ghost
And I'll sign it from a sinner with no name
When I meet my maker, will he close the book
On the hearts I broke and the lives I took
Will he walk away, cause my soul's to late to save

Now I ain't getting into heaven
If the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
Heading back to Santa Fe
Got debts to pay in Santa Fe
It's judgment day in Santa Fe

I will remember the love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain, all my mind can see now is your

Well I guess you took my youth and gave it all away
Like the birth of a new-found joy, this love would end in rage
And when she died, I couldn't cry, the pride within my soul

Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

No time, never got a thing to wear

Hear a ringing in my head now

One, two, three, go!

I never thought you'd hurt me, I guess you live and learn
That when you're playin' with fire, you're bound to get burned
Oh, I've been mistreated, I've been used before
I get kicked in the face, still I come back for more

But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces, start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl, I can't take any more

Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you've ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, you can do anything, but, baby, don't treat me bad
Oh, don't treat me bad

I gave it everything, but you threw it all away
I can't take any more of these games that you play
I've been through heartache and I've been through pain
And it's hard to believe you still treat me this way

But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces, start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl, I can't take any more

Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you've ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, you can do anything, but, baby, don't treat me bad
Whoa, don't treat me bad

Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, you can do anything, but, baby

Now listen to me
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, this could be the best thing that you've ever have
Baby, don't treat me bad
Well, you can do anything, but, baby, don't treat me bad

I felt this before now I feel it again
No matter how hard I try
This feeling won't end
So I pretend you're here by my side
Tonight on this lonely ride
Keep telling myself that
Life goes on while you're miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on as night steals the day
There's nothing I can do
You heal up my wounds
I tasted your tears
You spilled out your heart
So I let out my fears
But one fear that I kept to myself
How I prayed that you'd love no one else
Like you're saying you love me
Life goes on while you're miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on as night steals the day
There's nothing I can do
If you only knew how much I miss you
When my mind plays these tricks on me
It shows me things I don't want to see
That's why I tell myself now
I keep telling myself now
Just take another piece of me
Life goes on while you're miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on as night steals the day
There's nothing I can do
Life goes on you're still miles away
And I need you
And this last mile I travel with you

37,Uncle Tom's Cabin,Cherry Pie,Warrant,1990-10-14,241506,50,"

Just for the record, let's get the story straight
Me and Uncle Tom were fishin', it was gettin' pretty late
Out on a cypress limb above the wishin' well
Where they say it got no bottom, say it take you down to hell

Over in the bushes and off to the right
Come two men talkin' in the pale moonlight
Sheriff John Brady and Deputy Hedge
Haulin' two limp bodies down to the water's edge

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, oh, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell

They didn't see me and Tom in the tree
Neither one believin' what the other could see
Tossed in the bodies, let 'em sink on down
To the bottom of the well where they'd never be found

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, oh, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know who put the bodies in the wishin' well

[Guitar Solo]

Soon as they were gone, me and Tom got down
Prayin' real hard that we wouldn't make a sound
Runnin' through the woods back to Uncle Tom's shack
Where the full moon shines through the rooftop cracks

Oh my God, Tom, who are we gonna tell?
The Sheriff, he belongs in a prison cell
Keep your mouth shut, that's what we're gonna do
Unless you wanna wind up in the wishing well too

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
I know a secret that I just can't tell
I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin, ooh, yeah, yeah
I know a secret that I just can't tell
Oh, I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's cabin
Know who put the bodies, know who put the bodies
In the wishin' well, oh, yeah

I know you've heard it all before
So I don't say it anymore

And though I used to wonder why
I used to cry till I was dry
Still sometimes I get a strange pain inside
Oh, Joey, if you're hurting so am I

Joey, honey
I've got the money
All is forgiven
Listen

But if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you

And if you're somewhere out there passed out on the floor
Oh, Joey, I'm not angry anymore

You had something to hide
Should have hidden it, shouldn't you?

In a room above a busy street
The echoes of a life
The fragments and the accidents
Separated by incidents

Listen to by the walls
We share the same spaces
Repeated in the corridors
Performing the same movements

Storey to storey
Building to building
Street to street
We pass each other on the stairs

Storey to storey
Building to building
Street to street
We pass each other on the stairs

Listen to by the walls
We share the same spaces
Repeated in the corridors
Performing the same movements

The nature of your tragedy
Is chained around your neck
Do you lead or are you lead
Are you sure that you don't care

There are reasons here to give your life
And follow in your way
The passion lives to keep your faith
Though all are different, all are great

Climbing as we fall
We dare to hold on to our fate
And steal away our destiny
To catch ourselves
With quiet grace

Story to story
Building to building
Street to street
We pass each other on the stairs

Listen to by the walls
We share the same spaces
Repeated in the corridors
Performing the same movements

Story to story
Building to building
Street to street
We pass each other on the stairs

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you, and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

[Pre-Chorus]
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Verse 2]
Every whisper of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost, and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Consider this, consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around?
And now I've said too much

[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Bridge]
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now

You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love

Have you come to raise the dead?

In a darkened room
Beyond the reach of God's faith
Lies the wounded
The shattered remains of love betrayed
And the innocence
Of a child is bought and sold
In the name of the damned
The rage of the angels left silent and cold

Forgive me please for I know not what I do
How can I keep inside the hurt I know is true

Tell me when the kiss
Of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep
To hide behind this fear
Of running unto you
Please let there be light
In a darkened room

All the precious times
Have been put to rest again
And the smile of the dawn
Brings tainted lust singing my requiem
Can I face the day
When I'm tortured in my trust
And watch it crystalize
While my salvation it crumbles to dust

Why can't I steer the ship before it hits the storm
I've fallen to the sea but still I swim for shore

Tell me when the kiss
Of love becomes a lie
That bears the scar of sin too deep
To hide behind this fear
Of running unto you
Please let there be light
In a darkened room

Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking

On with the show

I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show

There's gotta be a record of you someplace
You gotta be on somebody's books
The lowdown a picture of your face
Your injured looks
The sacred and profane
The pleasure and the pain
Somewhere your fingerprints remain concrete
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

A ladykiller regulation tattoo
Silver spurs on his heels
Says ""What can I tell you as I'm standing next to you""
She threw herself under my wheels
Oh it's a dangerous road
And a hazardous load
And the fireworks over liberty explode in the heat
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

A three-chord symphony crashes into space
The moon is hanging upside down
I don't know why it is I'm still on the case
It's a ravenous town
And you still refuse to be traced
Seems to me such a waste
And every victory has a taste that's bittersweet
And it's your face I'm looking for on every street

Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead

[Verse 2]
With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

[Verse 3]
Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

[Bridge]
Well, this hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 4]
Now as you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

My child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew, he said
""I'm gonna be like you, Dad""
""You know, I'm gonna be like you""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play""
""Could you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today""

""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys""
""See you later. Can I have them, please?""

""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""

I've long since retired, my son's moved away

""You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu""

He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me

Like a firefly without a light

Promised myself I wouldn't weep

Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mystery seems so faded

[Verse 1]
Lost in the sky
Clouds roll by and I roll with them
Arrows fly
Seas increase and then fall again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This world is spinning around me
This world is spinning without me and
Every day sends future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last

[Verse 2]
Watch the sparrow falling
Gives new meaning to it all
If not today nor yet tomorrow
Then some other day
I'll take seven lives for one
And then my only father's son
As sure as I did ever love him
I am not afraid

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This world is spinning around me
The whole world keeps spinning around me
All life is future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last

[Chorus 1]
Pull me under, pull me under
Pull me under, I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is to set it right

[Verse 3]
Dust fills my eyes
Clouds roll by and I roll with them
Centuries cry
Orders fly and I fall again

[Pre-Chorus 3]
This world is spinning inside me
The whole world is spinning inside of me
Every day sends future to past
Every step brings me closer to my last

[Chorus 2]
Pull me under, pull me under
Pull me under, I'm not afraid
Living my life too much in the sun
Only until your will is done

[Chorus 1]
Pull me under, pull me under
Pull me under, I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is set it right

[Chorus 2]
Pull me under, pull me under
Pull me under, I'm not afraid
Living my life too much in the sun
Only until your will is done

[Intro]
Are you those guys on the beach that hate everything?
Eww! Is this some sort of hip music that I don't understand?

[Verse 1]
I hate the rain and sunny weather
And I, I hate the beach and mountains too, boo-hoo
And I don't like a thing about the city, no, no
And I, I, I, hate the countryside too!

And I, hate everything about you
Everything about you

[Verse 2]
And I don't like a thing about your mother
And I, I hate your daddy's guts too, boo-hoo
And I don't like a thing about your sister, no, no
Cause I, I, I think sex is overrated too

And I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around
I hate everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you

[Bridge]
Some say I've got a bad attitude
But that don't change the way I feel about you
And if you think this might be bringing me down
Look again cause I ain't wearing no frown

Well, I don't really care about your sister
Forget the little bitch, cause I already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady
I put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe

I know you know everybody knows
The way it comes, the way it's gonna go
You think it's sad
Well that's too bad
Cause I'm havin'
A ball hatin'
Every little thing about you! ha-ha!

Everything about you, everything about
I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around

I hate everything abou-u-u-ut

Wife and kids, household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere

Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathing his dying breath

Culture sucks down words
Itemise loathing and feed yourself smiles
Organise your safe tribal war
Hurt maim kill and enslave the ghetto

Each day living out a lie
Life sold cheaply forever, ever, ever

Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness

From feudal serf to spender

Survivals natural as sorrow, sorrow, sorrow

[Intro]
Come on
Ugh
Come on

[Verse 1]
Although ya try to discredit, ya still never read it
The needle, I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double ""I'm Mad"", still knee deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it'll never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy
Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease when their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police, (What!) the judges (What!), the feds
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah, back in this

[Verse 2]
With poetry my mind I flex
""Flip"" like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I got to, what do I got to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up?
'Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like taking photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the ""Stutter Step"" then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
20/20 visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

[Bridge]
What was the price on his head?
What was the price on his head!?
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard
I think I heard a shot

""Black Nationalism... [...]
[He] may be a brave contender for this position
But should he abandon his supposed 'obedience'
To the 'White liberal doctrine' of non-violence
And embrace Black Nationalism""

To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
Through counter-intelligence, it should be possible
To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them
And neutralize them""

122,Unsung,Meantime,Helmet,1992-01-01,236400,60,"

Your contribution left unnoticed some
Association with an image
Just credit time for showing up again
Attention wandered, I'm left with it

Gone by sin too slowly
Can't pass it up
Then I thought nothing is right
I turned it off

To die unsung would really bring you down
Although wet eyes would never suit you
Walk through, no archetypal suicide
Die young is far too boring these days

Your will to speak clearly
Exposed too much
Unsung once too often
Could not rub off

Nobody here really understands me
And so I wave goodbye, I'm fine

Said, you don't like the way I'm living (You don't like me)
Tones of home, tones of home

And I always thought this would be
See, the land of milk and honey
Oh, but I come to find out that it's all hate and money
And there's a canopy of greed holdin' me down

[Bridge]
See, I'm so high to you, but don't fade away, oh yeah
I said, you're on your own
Your mom and daddy said
That you sister said
And you brother's saying (what'd your brother say?)
Is saying everybody (everybody)
Is saying everybody
Is saying I-I-I-I gotta go!

All my friends patronize me

It seems they don't really know me

[Intro]
Crank the music up
Bring that shit in, uh
Yeah, the movement's in motion with massive militant poetry
Now check this out, uh

[Verse 1]
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read and write
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back

[Chorus]
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
We gotta take the power back

[Verse 2]
The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting to hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causing tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
And that, is why we gotta take the power back

We gotta take the power back
Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
Break it, break it down, aw shit

And like this
Uh! Come on
Yeah, bring it back the other way
Uh

[Verse 3]
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' Weathermen)
Expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
We gotta take the power back

Just a little of that human touch

Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town
Ain't no bread from heavenly skies
Ain't nobody drawin' wine from this blood
It's just you and me tonight

Tell me in a world without pity
Do you think what I'm askin's too much ?
I just want something to hold on to
And a little of that human touch
Just a little of that human touch

Oh girl that feeling of safety you prize
Well it comes with a hard hard price
You can't shut off the risk and pain
Without losin' the love that remains
We're all riders on this train

So you been broken and you been hurt
Show me somebody who ain't
Yeah I know I ain't nobody's bargain
But hell a little touchup
And a little paint...

You might need somethin' to hold on to
When all the answers they don't amount to much
Somebody that you can just talk to
And a little of that human touch

Baby in a world without pity
Do you think what I'm askin's too much ?
I just want to feel you in my arms
And share a little of that human touch...

Starry night bring me down
Till I realize the moon
It seems so distant yet
I felt it pass right through

And I see what I see
A new world is over me
So I'll reach up to the sky
And pretend that I'm a
Spaceman in another place and time
I guess I'm looking for a brand new place
Is there a better life for me?

Subtle wind blow me gone
Let me rest upon your move
I trust I'll end up sleeping
Cradled in my doom

And I feel what I feel
I can't grasp what is not real
So I'll get myself real high
And imagine I'm a
Spaceman, in another place and time
I guess I'm looking for a brand new place
Is there a better life for me?

And I remember in my mind
They say I'm a daydreaming
Is it all that it seems
Or am I all the things I'm looking for? Yeah

And I see what I see
A new world is over me
And I'll reach up to the sky
And imagine I'm a
Spaceman in another place and time
I guess I'm looking for a brand new place
I remember living in a different life
Is there a better life for me?

Know your enemy

Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the slit wrist
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Fist in ya face in the place and I'll drop the style clearly
Know your enemy

Know your enemy
Yeah
Ayo, get with this, ugh

Word is born
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Now I got no patience
So sick of complacence
With the D, the E, the F, the I, the A, the N, the C, the E
Mind of a revolutionary, so clear the lane
The finger to the land of the chains
What? The ""land of the free""?
Whoever told you that is your enemy
Now something must be done
About vengeance, a badge, and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system
I was born to rage against 'em
Now action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in

136,A Letter To Elise,Wish,The Cure,1992-01-01,312240,54,"

[Chorus]
Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

[Verse]
Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire
The way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would, if they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing
Something else that hides away
From me and you, there are worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh, I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I'll throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round yesterday
I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do
Elise, believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke and make-believe ran out

[Chorus]
So, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

[Outro]
And every time I try to pick it up
Like falling sand
As fast as I pick it up
It runs away through my clutching hands
But there's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else I can really do
At all

You want commitment
Take a look into these eyes
They burn with fire (Yeah)
Until the end of time
And I would do anything
I'd beg, I'd steal, I'd die
To have you in these arms tonight

Baby I want you
Like the roses want the rain
You know I need you
Like a poet needs the pain
And I would give anything
My blood, my love, my life

And love you until the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight

We stared at the sun

A promise this world would never blind us
And these were our words
Our words were our songs
Our songs are our prayers
These prayers keep me strong
And I still believe
If you were in these arms

I'd hold you, I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you

If ever words were spoken painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life, all I wanted
Was the keeping of someone like you
As it turns out, deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you
Never ending pain, quickly ending life

You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one stole her from herself
This gift in pain, her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you
I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break

You keep this love

You can see I'm in no shape for driving
And anyway, I've got no place to go
And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago

Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone but something might be found

This here is the place where I will be staying
There isn't a number, you can call the pay phone
Let it ring a long, long, long, long time
If I don't pick up, hang up, call back, let it ring some more
Oh
If I don't pick up, pick up
The sidewinder sleeps, sleeps, sleeps in a coil

Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Oh

[Verse 2]
There are scratches all around the coin slot
Like a heartbeat, baby trying to wake up
But this machine can only swallow money
You can't lay a patch by computer design
It's just a lot of stupid, stupid signs
Tell her
Tell her she can kiss my ass
Then laugh and say that you were only kidding
That way she'll know that it's really, really, really, really me

Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Oh

[Verse 3]
Baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me
Today I need something more sub-sub-sub-substantial
A can of beans or black-eyed peas, some Nescafe and ice
A candy bar, a falling star, or a reading from Doctor Seuss

[Chorus]
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her
Call me when you try to wake her up
Call me when you try to wake her

[Verse 4]
The cat in the hat came back
Wreaked a lot of havoc on the way
Always had a smile and a reason to pretend
But their world has flat backgrounds
And little need to sleep but to dream
The sidewinder sleeps on his back

[Chorus]
Call me when you try to wake her up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
Call me when you try to wake her up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
I can always sleep standing up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
Oh
Call me when you try to wake her up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
Call me when you try to wake her up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
I can always sleep standing up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
Oh

Call me when you try to wake her up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
I can always sleep standing up

And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

[Verse 1]
Every time we do this, I fall for her
Wave after wave after wave, it's all for her
""I know this can't be wrong"", I say
(And I'll lie to keep her happy)
As long as I know that you know
That today I belong right here with you
Right here with you

And so we watch the sun come up
From the edge of the deep green sea
And she listens like her head's on fire
Like she wants to believe in me
So I try put your hands in the sky
Surrender, remember
We'll be here forever
And we'll never say goodbye

I've never been so colorfully
See through head before
(I've never been) I've never been so
Wonderfully me you want some more
And all I want is to keep it like this
You and me alone, a secret kiss
And don't go home, don't go away
Don't let this end, please stay

Not just for today

""Never, never, never, never, never let me go"", she says
""Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days""
But suddenly she slows and looks down at my breaking face
""Why do you cry? What did I say?""
""But it's just rain"", I smile brushing my tears away

[Chorus 1]
I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears, too many times
Too many years I've cried over you

[Verse 2]
How much more can we use it up?
Drink it dry? Take this drug?
Looking for something forever gone
But something we will always want

""Why, why, why are you letting me go?"" she says
""I feel you pulling back, I feel you changing shape""
And just as I'm breaking free, she hangs herself in front of me
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
And hands in the sky, surrenders it all

[Chorus 2]
I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears, too many times
Too many years I've cried for you

It's always the same, wake up in the rain
Head in pain, hung in shame
A different name, same old game, love in vain
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Away from home again

[Intro]
Across the border they turn
Water into wine
Some say it's the devil's blood
They're squeezing from the vine
Some say it's a savior
In these hard and desperate times
You see it helps me to forget
That we're just born to die

[Verse 1]
I came here like so many did
To find a better life
To find my piece of easy street
And finally be alive
I knew nothing good comes easy
All good things take some time
I made my bed, I'll lie in it
To die in it's the crime

You can't help but prosper
Where the streets are paved with gold
They say the oil wells ran deeper here
Than anybody's known
Now I packed up on my wife and kid
And left them both back home
See, there's nothing in this pay dirt
The ghosts are all I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the oil's gone
And the money's gone
All the jobs are gone
Still we're hanging on

[Chorus]
Down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one is getting out of here alive
(Not this time)

[Verse 2]
""In the blessed name of Jesus""
I heard a preacher say
""We are all God's children
And he'd be back, back someday""
I hoped that he knew
Something as he drank that cup of wine
I didn't have too good of a feeling
As I head out to the night

I cursed the sky to open
I begged the clouds for rain
I prayed all night for water
For this burning in my veins (Every night's the same)
It was like my soul's on fire
And I had to watch the flames
All my dreams went up in ashes
And my future blew away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the oil's gone
And the money's gone
All the jobs are gone
Still we're hanging on

[Chorus]
Down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash theese sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one's getting out of here alive

[Verse 3]
A man spends his whole life
Waiting praying for some big reward
But it seems sometimes
That payoff leaves you feeling
Like a dirty whore
If I could choose the way I'd die
Make it by the gun or knife
Because the other way there's too much pain
Night after night after night after night

[Chorus]
Oh, down in dry county
They're swimming in the sand
Praying for some holy water
To wash these sins from off our hands
In dry county
The promise has run dry
Where nobody cries
And no one's getting out of here
Dry County
No one is getting out of here
Dry County
No

I was yours and you were mine forget it all

Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won you give for free

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

I found about you

[VERSE]
I'm looking outside of my window
The view that I see
Is a child and mama
And the child is begging for money
Tell me why, tell me why
The woman is blind
Is she so broke
The kid's dealing crime

[Chorus]
It's such a beautiful city
But the word is burning it down

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
It's such a beautiful city
But the world is burning it down

[VERSE]
I go to my room to turn on the tv
I sit myself down
And I start laughing hard
'Cause this man he's asking for money
He says, ""If you send me lots of cash
I'll send you stuff to make you rich fast.""

[Chorus]
It's such a wonderful country
But the man, he's burning it down

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
And it's burning down
And it's called the US of A

[BRIDGE]
One day I'm going to have lots of money
But I'll have to give it up for this rich society, oh
Oh please Mr. President will you lend me a future?
'Cause you'll just get it back
From the little blind woman
With the kid on the corner
And the people all over, doin' crack

[Chorus]
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down
Sing it -
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
And it's burning down
And it's called the US of A

[VERSE]
I'm walking outside on a sunny day
With no one around
And I wonder what's wrong
Then I hear this loud piercing siren
Oh my God the bomb has just dropped
And everybody climbed right on top screaming

[Chorus]
""What a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down
He's burning it down""

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down
He's burning it down

Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea

And it's burning down, and it's called the US of A

All alone, the broadening skies
Under thee, every night, I lie (every night, I will lie)
Scratch and claw and grip the rails
Every day, my living hell
Oh God, you know I try
I know how hard I try, you know I try

[Verse 1]
Hey, I'd like to daze away
To a place no one has known
In a state of mind I could call mine
That only I could own
Where I can hum a tune anytime I choose
And there's no such thing as time
Where I feel no pain, just calm and sane
What a place for one to find

[Chorus]
Now, you see
I'm watching everything I do
And they're watching everything I say
So they will leave me be
Whoa, leave me be

Why am I even here?
And I wonder
You leave me wondering
You leave me wondering

Won't you stop watching me?
I said, they're watching me, watching me, watching me, yeah

Now, in my corner
I got their stealin' in my eyes, and
And arms holding up my knees
And, man, rocking back and forth's my life
I didn't mean to feel this way
When I walked into the door
And they ripped away my memories
And I can't remember who I was before
Lord, no, Lord, no

[Chorus]
And now, they're watching everything I do
And they're watching everything I say
So they'll leave me be
Oh, leave me be

And I only wanted to be sixteen
And free, yeah

So you're looking for some action, I got got everything you need
Better keep your motor running, because I was built for speed

[Verse 1]
When I see you sky as a kite
As high as I might, I can't get that high
The how you move, the way you burst the clouds
It makes me want to try
And when I see you sticky as lips
As licky as trips, I can't lick that far
But when you pout, the way you shout out loud
It makes me want to start
And when I see you happy as a girl
That swims in a world of a magic show
It makes me bite my fingers through
To think I could've let you go

[Chorus]
And when I see you take the same sweet steps
You used to take, I say
""I'll keep on holding you in my arms so tight
I'll never let you slip away""

And when I see you kitten as a cat
Yeah, as smitten as that, I can't get that small
The way you fur, the how you purr
It makes me want to paw you all
And when I see you happy as a girl
That lives in a world of make believe
It makes me pull my hair all out
To think I could've let you leave

And when I see you take the same sweet steps
You used to take, I know
I'll keep on holding you in my arms so tight
I'll never let you go

[Verse 1]
Hey now, little speedyhead
The read on the speed-meter says
You have to go to task in the city
Where people drown and people serve
Don't be shy, you're just dessert
Is only just light years to go

[Chorus 1]
Me, my thoughts are flower strewn
With ocean storm, bayberry moon
I have got to leave to find my way
Watch the road and memorize
This life that passed before my eyes
And nothing is going my way

[Verse 2]
The ocean is the river's goal
A need to leave the water knows
We're closer now than light years to go

[Chorus 2]
I have got to find the river
Bergamot and vetiver
Run through my head and fall away
Leave the road and memorize
This life that passed before my eyes
And nothing is going my way

[Verse 3]
There's no one left to take the lead
But I tell you and you can see
We're closer now than light years to go
Pick up here and chase the ride
The river empties to the tide
Fall into the ocean

[Chorus 3]
The river to the ocean goes
A fortune for the undertow
None of this is going my way
There is nothing left to throw
Of Ginger, lemon, indigo
Coriander stem and rose of hay

Strength and courage overrides
The privileged and weary eyes
Of river poet search naiveté
Pick up here and chase the ride
The river empties to the tide
All of this is coming your way

[Verse 1]
I want to tell if I am or I am not myself
It's hard to know how far or if at all could go
Waiting far too long for something I forgot was wrong
I don't know all the answers I think that I'll find
Or have it within the time but it's all that I'll have in mind

Until I fall away
That won't keep us waiting long
Until I fall away
I don't know what to do anymore
Until I fall away

My fear pretend that I'll never be in love again
It's real to me but not like these fools and not like this scene
I won't find or have it within the time
If it's all rusted and fade in the spot where we fell
Where I thought I'd left behind
It's loose now but we could try

When there's no good answers
To those new questions
Another personal disaster
There's nowhere to go but down

And I've learned not to say never
Else I'll seem the fool

29, you'd think I'd know better
Living like a kid
Cause when my lies may seem less than clever
It's when I fall for it

Only time will tell
If wishing wells
Can bring us anything
Fade like scenes
From childhood dreams
Forgotten memories

Some rides don't have much of a finish
That's the ride I took
Through good and bad and straight through indifferent
Without a second look

There's no intentions worthy of mention
If we never try
So hang your hopes on rusted out hinges
Take 'em for a ride

Only time will tell
If wishing wells
Will bring us anything
Fade like scenes
From childhood dreams
Forgotten memories

Some rides don't have much of a finish
That's the ride I took
Through good and bad and straight through indifferent
Without a second look

Only time will tell
If wishing wells
Will bring us anything
Fade like scenes

And some days I pray for silence
And some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll
And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No no no, I won't do that

[Hook]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do

[Verse 3]
But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
No way
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No, I won't do that

[Call (and Response)]
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
(I can do that
Oh, I can do that)
Will you hold me sacred
Will you hold me tight
Will you colorize my life
I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old?
(I can do that
Oh no now, I can do that)
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands?
Can you build an emerald city with these grains of sand?
Can you give me something I can take home?
(Now, I can do that
Ooh now, I can do that)
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
(Now, I can do that
Oh now, I can do that)
After a while you'll forget everything
As a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling
Then you'll see that it's time to move on
(I won't do that
I won't do that)
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later, you'll be screwing around
(I won't do that
No, I won't do that)

Anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that

Dressed up like a car crash
Your wheels are turnin' but you're upside down

You say when he hits you, you don't mind
Because when he hurts you, you feel alive
Oh no, is that what it is?

Red lights, grey morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim
It depends on who's around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip-synch to the talk shows

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing

If I could stay, then the night would give you up
Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay, and the night would be enough

Faraway, so close

With satellite television
You can go anywhere:
Miami, New Orleans
London, Belfast and Berlin

And, if you listen, I can't call
And, if you jump, you just might fall
And, if you shout, I'll only hear you

Stay, and the day would keep its trust
Stay with the demons you drowned
Stay with the spirit I found
Stay, and the night would be enough

It's quiet, there's no one around

Had a good lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights
Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on
Keep movin' on""

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain

Yeah-yeah!

[Verse 1]
Well, I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin' about all those things you said
About ordinary people and how they make you sick
And if callin' names kicks back on you, then I hope this does the trick

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm sick of your complainin' about how many bills
And I'm sick of all your bitchin' 'bout your poodles and your pills
And I just can't see no humor about your way of life
And I think I can do more for you with this here fork and knife!

Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh huh!

[Verse 2]
So I called up my head shrinker, and I told him what I'd done
He said ""You'd best go on a diet, yeah I hope you have some fun
And-a don't go burst a bubble on the rich folks who get rude
'Cause you won't get in no trouble when you eats that kinda food""

Now they're smokin' up the jail bonds, and then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club with Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens when you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit, but go real good with wine!

Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh!

Believe in all the good things that money just can't buy
Then you won't get no belly ache from eatin' humble pie

So take your Grey Pompon my friend and shove it up your ass!

Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for

When I think of Heaven, deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of flying down in your sea of pens and feathers
And all other instruments of faith and sex and God
In the belly of a black-winged bird

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to feed me
'Cause I've been here before
And I deserve a little more

[Chorus]
And I belong in the service of the queen
And I belong anywhere but in between
She's been crying and I've been thinking
And I am the rain king

[Verse 2]
And I said, ""Mama, mama, mama, why am I so alone""
'Cause I can't go outside, I'm scared I might not make it home
Well I'm alive, I'm alive, but I'm sinking in
If there's anyone at home at your place, darling
Why don't you invite me in?

Don't try to feed me
'Cause I've been here before
And I deserve a little more

Hey, I only want the same as anyone

Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends
After all the dreaming, I come home again

When I think of Heaven, deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of dying, lay me down in a field of flame and heather
Render up my body into the burning heart of God
In the belly of a black-winged bird

Don't try to feed me
'Cause I've been here before
And I deserve a little more

[Verse 1]
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William, but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if
He's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Verse 2]
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Bridge]
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
Cars
The sun and the moon but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party's just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I don't need to be a global citizen
'Cause I'm blessed by nationality

We enforce our popularity
There are things that seem to pull us under, and
There are things that drag us down
But there's a power and a vital presence
That's lurking all around

See him on the interstate
We've got the American Jesus
He helped build the president's estate

I feel sorry for the earth's population
'Cause so few live in the U.S.A
At least the foreigners can copy our morality
They can visit, but they cannot stay
Only precious few can garner the prosperity
It makes us walk with renewed confidence
We've got a place to go when we die
And the architect resides right here

The force the army wields (We trust!)
Expressions on the faces of the starving millions
(Because he's one of us)
The power of the man (Break down!)
The fuel that drives the Klan (Cave in!)
He's the motive and conscience of the murderer
(We can redeem your sin)
He's the preacher on T.V. (Strong heart!)
The false sincerity (Clear mind!)
The form letter that's written by the big computers
(And infinitely kind)
The nuclear bombs (You lose!)
The kids with no moms (We win!)
And I'm fearful that he's inside me

Step out the front door like a ghost into a fog
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white
In between the moon and you, the angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right

Well, I walk in the air between the rain
Through myself and back again
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying
Through the door, I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

'Round here, we always stand up straight
'Round here, something radiates

Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus

She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

'Round here, we're carving out our names
'Round here, we all look the same
'Round here, we talk just like lions but we sacrifice like lambs
'Round here, she's slipping though my hands

Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says, ""It's only in my head""
She says, ""Shh, I know it's only in my head""

But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says, ""Man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?""
Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life
She must be tired of something

'Round here, she's always on my mind
'Round here, hey man, got lots of time
Round here, we're never sent to bed early
Man, nobody makes us wait
'Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late

My friend assures me, ""It's all or nothing""
I am not worried, I am not overly concerned
My friend implores me, ""For one time only
Make an exception"" I am not worried

Wrap her up in a package of lies
Send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried
I am not overly concerned

With the status of my emotions
Oh, she says, ""You're changing""
But we're always changing
It does not bother me to say

This isn't love
'Cause if you don't wanna talk about it
Then it isn't love
And I guess, I'm gonna have to live with that

But I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray
Or something in between
And I can always change my name
If that's what you mean

My friend assures me, ""It's all or nothing""
But I am not really worried
I am not overly concerned

You try to tell yourself the things, you try to tell yourself
To make yourself forget, to make yourself forget
I am not worried

""If it's love,"" She said
""Then we've gonna have to think about the consequences""
Cause she can't stop shaking
And I can't stop touching her

And this time, when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away
And Anna begins to change her mind

""These seconds when I'm shaking
Leave me shuddering for days,"" She says
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

But I'm not gonna break
And I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
I'm not gonna bend and I'm not gonna break
Gonna worry about it anymore
No, no, no, no, no

It seems like I should say
""As long as this is love""
But it's not all that easy, so maybe I should

Snap her up in a butterfly net
And pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried
'Cause I've done this sort of thing before

But then I start to think about the consequences
'Cause I don't get no sleep in a quiet room

And this time, when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away
And Anna begins to change my mind

Every time she sneezes, I believe it's love
And oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake
And Anna begins to toss and turn

And every word is nonsense, but I understand
And oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along
And Anna begins to fade away

It's chasing me away, she disappears
And oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

You feel it take control

Come around town, steal another dime
Take another line, won't you feel it blanket your soul
Out of mind
Come around town, steal another dime
Do another crime, won't you get it higher and higher
All through time
Come around town, steal another dime
Don't you push your drugs in my face, yes, I feel it
Feeling fine
Don't you push your drugs in my face
Or I'm gonna put you in your place
Fuck you, I don't want it no more
And it's mine
Said this pain in my heart, it's all mine
Yes, it's mine
All alone

I don't want it no more

Start tearing the old man down
Run past the heather and down to the old road
Start turning the grain into the ground
Roll a new leaf over

In the middle of the night
There's an old man treading around in the gathered rain
Hey, mister, if you're gonna walk on water
Could you drop a line my way?

Omaha, somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door

Start threading the needle
Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room
Start turning the wool across the wire
Roll the new life over

In the middle of the night
There's an old man threading his toes
Through a bucket of rain
Hey, mister, you don't wanna walk on water
'Cause you're only gonna walk all over me

Omaha, somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door

Start running the banner down
Drop past the color
Come up through the summer rain
Start turning the girl into the ground
Roll a new love over

In the middle of the day, there's a young man
Rolling around in the earth and rain
Hey mister, if you're gonna walk on water
You know you're only gonna walk all over me

Omaha, somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more

Are just memories of a different life

To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear

Butane in my veins, and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat
Someone came, saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey neck, and it's hanging from a pigeon wing

All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

Make sure you do it wise

Pinned down and abused for being strange
Our love is no other

[Verse 1]
My name is Jonas, I'm carryin' the wheel
Thanks for all you've shown us, but this is how we feel
Come sit next to me, pour yourself some tea
Just like Grandma made when we couldn't find sleep
Things were better then, once but never again
We've all left the den, let me tell you about it

[Chorus 1]
The choo-choo train left right on time
A ticket cost only your mind
The driver said, ""Hey man, we go all the way""
Of course we were willing to pay

[Verse 2]
My name is Wepeel, got a box full of your toys
They're fresh out of batteries, but they're still making noise, making noise
Tell me what to do now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat and you know what else?
Guess what I received in the mail today
Words of deep concern from my little brother

[Chorus 2]
The building's not goin' as he planned
The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path
The driver swears he learned his math

In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine

Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

Let me run with you tonight
I'll take you on a moonlight ride
There's someone I used to see
But she don't give a damn for me

But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud

You don't know how it feels to be me

People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up in between
A memory and a dream

You don't know how it feels

My old man was born to rock
He's still tryin' to beat the clock

Don't like the taste of it
Don't like the smell of it

Shove it up, inside, surprise!
Lies, stains like the blood on your teeth
Bite, chew, suck away the tender parts
I want to break it up
I want to smash it up
I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down
Maybe afraid of it
Let's discredit it
Let's pick away at it
I want to watch it come down

All the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
Take the skin and peel it back
Now doesn't it make you feel better?
The pigs have won tonight
Now they can all sleep soundly

Her intentions fall to the floor
The angel closes her eyes, the confusion that was hers
Belongs now, to the baby down the hall

Oh, now I feel it comin' back again
Like a rollin' thunder chasing the wind
Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again

This moment she's been waiting for
The angel opens her eyes, pale blue colored iris
Presents the circle, and puts the glory out to hide, hide

Forces pullin' from the center of the earth again

[Verse 1]
It doesn't matter what I say
So long as I sing with inflection
That makes you feel I'll convey
Some inner truth or vast reflection
But I've said nothing so far
And I can keep it up for as long as it takes
And it don't matter who you are
If I'm doing my job, it's your resolve that breaks

[Hook]
Because the Hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The Hook brings you back
On that you can rely

[Verse 2]
There is something amiss
I am being insincere
In fact I don't mean any of this
Still my confession draws you near
To confuse the issue I'll refer
To familiar heroes from long ago
No matter how much Peter loved her
What made the Pan refuse to grow

[Hook]
Was that the hook that brings you back
I ain't telling you no lie
The hook brings you back
On that you can rely

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Suck it in, suck it in, suck it in
If you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn
Make a desperate move or else you'll win
And then begin to see what you're doing to me
This MTV is not for free
It's so PC it's killing me
So, desperately, I sing to thee of love
Sure, but also of rage and hate and pain and fear of self
And I can't keep these feelings on the shelf
I've tried -- well, no, in fact, I lied
Could be financial suicide but I've got too much pride inside
To hide or slide I'll do as I'll decide
And let it ride until I've died
And only then shall I abide this tide
Of catchy little tunes
Of hip three minute ditties
I wanna bust all your balloons
I wanna burn all of your cities to the ground
I've found I will not mess around
Unless I play, then hey, I will go on all day
Hear what I say, I have a prayer to pray
That's really all this was
And when I'm feeling stuck and need a buck
I don't rely on luck because

[Hook]
The hook brings you back
I ain't telling you no lie
The hook
On that you can rely

And you came tumbling after
Cause of original sin

Drink a hope to happy years
And you may find
A lifetime's passed you by

If you a doggie on a chain

Ate his head, thought it was a candy
Everyone goes in the end
Knock, knock on the door

[Verse 1]
You can't resist her, she's in your bones
She is your marrow, and your ride home
You can't avoid her, she's in the air (in the air)
In between molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide

[Chorus]
Only in dreams, we see what it means
Reach out our hands, hold onto hers
But when we wake, it's all been erased
And so it seems, only in dreams

[Verse 2]
You walk up to her, ask her to dance

You say, ""It's a good thing that you float in the air (in the air)
That way, there's no way I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces...""

Only in dreams, we see what it means
Reach out our hands, hold onto hers

Alcohol on my hands, I got plans
To ditch myself and get outside
Dancing women throwing plates
Decapitating their laughing dates
Swirling chickens caught in flight
Out of focus, much too bright
Coming down
Shiny teeth
Game show suckers trying to bleed
But I got a drug and I got the bug
And I got something better than love

[Break]
How you like me now?
Pretty good
Going on, feeling strong

[Verse 2]
I quit my job blowing leaves
Telephone bills up my sleeves
Choking like a one man dust bowl
Freedom rock slime ball talking in code
Went down
Lit up the shack
Grab me a beer out of the sack
Everybody bent over twice
Painting the walls, throwing some dice
Leaping up into the air getting juiced up beyond belief

[Chorus]
(And they were singing like this:)
Winos throwing Frisbees at the sun
Put my soul between a bun
Now I'm hungry, now I'm drunk
Now I'm running like a flaming pig

Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Don't be kind, don't be rude
Just shake your boots and let it all get loose

Oh, that is cold
Somebody put a flame-thrower on that

Take me down to the depot

250,Run-Around,Four,Blues Traveler,1994-01-01,279800,65,"

Oh, once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek, so shall we find
And when you're feeling open, I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

And shake me and my confidence
'Bout a great many things
But I've been there, I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing, ""Hey babe, let's keep in touch
Hey baby, let's keep in touch""

But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Ha la la la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking
And I got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Oh sure, the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah, I will drink in and always be full

Oh, I like coffee and I like tea
Like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well, all right, okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Oh, you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

The needle tears a hole

Try to kill it all away

Goes away in the end

Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear

Goes away in the end

Caught her eye

She said ""fine""
And then in thirty seconds time she said

Wanna sleep with common people

[Verse 1]
Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

[Verse 2]
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away

So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high

See what you came to see
Been what you wanna be

[Intro]
I was walking around, just a face in the crowd
Trying to keep myself out of the rain
Saw a vagabond king wear a styrofoam crown
Wondered if I might end up the same
There's a man out on the corner
Singing old songs about change
Everybody got their cross to bare these days

[Verse 1]
She came looking for some shelter
With a suitcase full of dreams
To a motel room on the boulevard
I guess she's trying to be James Dean
She's seen all the disciples
And all the wannabes
No one wants to be themselves these days
Still there's nothing to hold on to but these days

[Chorus]
These days, the stars seem out of reach
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets
These days are fast, nothing lasts in this graceless age
There ain't nobody left but us these days

[Verse 2]
Jimmy Shoes, he busted both his legs
Trying to learn to fly
From a second story window
He just jumped and closed his eyes
His momma said he was crazy
He said, ""Momma, i've got to try
Don't you know that all my heroes died?
And I guess I'd rather die than f-f-fade away"", yeah

[Chorus]
These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, nothing lasts, it's a graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train
There ain't nobody left but us these days

[Bridge]
(Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh) I know Rome's still burning
(Whoa, oh-oh-oh-oh) Though the times have changed

[Chorus]
These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, love don't last, it's a graceless age
Even innocence has caught the midnight train

These days, the stars seem out of reach, yeah
These days, there ain't a ladder on the streets, oh no no
These days are fast, nothing lasts, there ain't no time to waste
There ain't nobody left to take the blame
Oh no no no, ain't nobody left but us these days
Ain't nobody left but us these days

There's a time and place for everything, for everyone
We can push with all our might, but nothing's gonna come
Oh no, nothing's gonna change
And if I asked you not to try
Oh could you let it be
I wanna hold you and say
We can't throw this all away
Tell me you won't go, you won't go
Do you have to hear me say

You know my heart is true, oh

Hold on
I'm holding on
Baby, just come on, come on, come on
I just wanna hear you say

Oh, I'm twisted and tied
And all I can remember

Only to surrender

I know how it's gonna be
And true love will never die

And I know what I got to do
Hey Ray, what you said is true
I can't stop lovin' you, oh

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Slowly fade away

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger, I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands

Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one

A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing

I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

It wears me out
It wears me out

But forever after ain't what it's all cracked up to be
Yeah, i had a taste, you were my fantasy

I don't need no guru to tell me what to do
When you're feeling like a headline on
Yesterday's news

Come on, come on, come on

Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel i've been dangling from a hang-man's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right
Something like you

Loneliness has found a home in me
My suitcase and guitar are my only family
I've tried to need someone, like they needed me
Well I opened up my heart, but all i did was bleed

They don't make a bandage, that's going to cover my bruise

Make me feel all right
Something like you

Come on, come on, come on

Pull me under (help i'm falling)
Through my veins
To a place
Where i feel no pain
Be the pillow under my head (night is calling)
Cover me when i'm in your bed
Take me higher than i've ever been(feels like i'm flying)
Take me down and back again
Come to me, be my disguise (christ i'm dying)
Open your coat, let me crawl inside
Come on, come on, come on

Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel i've been dangling from a hang-man's noose

Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel i've been dangling from a hang-man's noose
Give me shelter from the rain

Peaches come from a can
They were put there by a man
In a factory downtown
If I had my little way
I'd eat peaches every day
Sun-soakin' bulges in the shade

I took a little nap where the roots all twist
Squished a rotten peach in my fist
And dreamed about you, woman
I poked my finger down inside
Make a little room for an ant to hide
Nature's candy in my hand or can or a pie

Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free
Millions of peaches, peaches for me
Millions of peaches, peaches for free (Look out!)
Millions of peaches, peaches for me

Looking around the house
Hidden behind the window and the door
Searching for signs of life
But there's nobody home

Well, maybe I'm just too sure
Or maybe I'm just too frightened by the sound of it
Pieces of note fall down, but the letter said

[Chorus:]
Aha, it was good
Living with you, aha, it was good
Ah-ah-ah-ah-aha it was good
Living with you, aha, it was good
Ah-ah-ah, good good good

Sitting around the house
Watching the sun trace the shadow on the floor
Searching for signs of life
But there's nobody home
Well, maybe I'll call or I'll write you a letter
Now maybe we'll see on the fourth of July
But I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud
Well I'm not sure, and I'm not too proud to say

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, you were so good
Yeah, you were so good
Yeah, that's right

Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

Well, don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights

Oh, I've had it up to here

[Verse 2]
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype

Oh, I've had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?

I'm just a girl

That's all that you'll let me be

Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me

Lonely and dreaming of the west coast
I don't want to be your downtime
I don't want to be your stupid game

With my big black boots and an old suitcase
I do believe I'll find myself a new place
I don't want to be the bad guy

I just want to see some palm trees
I will try and shake away this disease

Leave the fire behind
Swim out past the breakers
Watch the world die
We could live beside the ocean
Leave the fire behind

Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away
I don't want to be your good time
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore

I'll walk right out into a brand new day
Insane and rising in my own weird way

I just want to find some place to be alone

So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there?

So don't try to deny it pretty baby
You've been down so long you can hardly see
When the engine's stalled and it won't stop raining

Fact that you don’t even know makes it fully legit

Now it’s morning but last night’s on my mind
There’s something I need to get off my chest
And no matter what will come to shine
The dream will always be mine

You keep me coming
That is a gal that’ll kill ‘dem stunning
Keep me coming
That is a gal that’ll kill ‘dem stunning
Keep me coming
That is a gal that’ll kill ‘dem stunning
Keep me coming
That is a gal that’ll kill ‘dem stunning

You make me nervous throat dry
My brain is empty don’t know why
But I saw you doing something
Which is really truly nothing
But you could bust me out all day

Many moons since first I saw you
Many moons since first we did the do
Many moons since first I saw you
Many moons since first we did the do

And why did I try when I knew it was no and
Why did I try when I saw it was so
But save it for late we should just let it skate
Cause the waiting feel is fine

[Verse 1]
I wish I would've met you
Now it's a little late
What you could've taught me
I could've saved some face
They think that your early ending was all wrong
For the most part, they're right
But look how they all got strong

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I say, ""Hey, man, nice shot
Good shot, man.""
That's why I say, ""Hey, man, nice shot
Good shot, man.""

[Chorus]
A man has gun
Hey, man, have fun
Nice shot

[Verse 2]
Now that the smoke's gone
And the air is all clear
Those who were right there
Got a new kind of fear
You'd fight and you were right
But they were just too strong
They'd stick it in your face
And let you smell what they consider wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I say, ""Hey, man, nice shot
Good shot, man.""
That's why I say, ""Hey, man, nice shot
What a good shot, man.""

Hey, man, have fun

Rumour has it that your daddy's coming down
He's gonna pay the rent
Tell me baby, is this as good as life is gonna get
It feels like there's a stranger who's standing in these shoes
But I know I can't lose me, cause then I'd be losing you

I know I promised baby
I would be the one to make our dreams come true
I ain't too proud of all the struggles
And the hard times we've been through
When this cold world comes between us
Please tell me you'll be brave
Because I can realize the danger when forgiveness fades away

[Chorus]
If you don't love me - lie to me
Because baby you're the one thing I'll believe
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be
Right now if you don't love me baby - lie to me

Pour another cup of coffee
Babe i got something to say to you (I don't wanna die no more)
I ain't got the winning ticket
Not the one that's gonna pull us through (I don't wanna die no more)
No one said that it'd be easy
Let your old man take you home
But know that if you walk out on me that darling
I'd be gone

If you don't love me - lie to me

The ups and downs will make you scream sometimes
It's hard believing that the thrill is gone
But we got to go around again, so let's hold on

If you don't love me - lie to me
Because baby you're the one thing I'll believe
Let it all fall down around us

Go on, lie to me

The funny thing is, he's not going to come
He's not going to find me

Rattle inside your head, feel redeemed like cola bottles

(Der Wahnsinn)
Ist nur eine schmale Brücke
Die Ufer sind Vernunft und Trieb
Ich steig' dir nach
Das Sonnenlicht den Geist verwirrt
Ein blindes Kind das vorwärts kriecht
Weil es seine Mutter riecht
(Ich finde dich)
Die Spur ist frisch und auf die Brücke
Tropft dein Schweiß dein warmes Blut
Ich seh' dich nicht
Ich riech' dich nur ich spüre Dich
Ein Raubtier das vor Hunger schreit
Wittere ich dich meilenweit

Du riechst so gut, du riechst so gut ich geh' dir hinterher
Du riechst so gut, ich finde dich
So gut, so gut ich steig dir nach
Du riechst so gut, gleich hab ich dich

(Jetzt hab ich dich)
Ich warte bis es dunkel ist
Dann fass ich an die nasse Haut
Verrate mich nicht
Oh siehst du nicht die Brücke brennt
Hör auf zu schreien und wehre dich nicht
Weil sie sonst auseinander bricht

[Verse 1]
Reluctantly crouched at the starting line
Engines pumping and thumping in time
The green light flashes, the flags go up
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup
They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank
Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern
As they speed through the finish, the flags go down
The fans get up and they get out of town
The arena is empty except for one man
Still driving and striving as fast as he can

[Pre-Chorus]
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns

[Chorus]
He's going the distance
He's going for speed
She's all alone (All alone)
All alone in her time of need
Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
He's going the distance

[Post-Chorus]
Yah!

[Verse 2]
No trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine
He's haunted by something he cannot define
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force
In his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade
She's hoping in time that her memories will fade
'Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse

The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's striving and driving and hugging the turns

She's always worried about things like that
She said, ""It's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault""

[Refrain]
And she only sleeps when it`s raining
And she screams, and her voice is straining

[Chorus]
And she says, ""Baby, it's three AM, I must be lonely""
And she says, ""Baby, well, I can't help
But be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe this""

[Verse 2]
She's got a little bit of something, God, it's better than nothing
And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all
She swears that the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to

And she only sleeps when it's raining
And she screams and her voice is straining

[Chorus]
And she says, ""Baby, when it's three AM I must be lonely""
Well, heaven she says, ""Baby, well, I can't help
But be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe this""

[Verse 3]
Well, she believes that life isn't made up of all that you're used to
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days and days
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway
But outside it's stopped raining

[Chorus (Extended)]
And she says, ""Baby, It's 3 am I must be lonely""
Well, heaven she says, ""Baby, well, I can't help
But be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe this""
Well, it's three AM, I must be lonely
Well, heaven she says, ""Baby, well, I can't help
But be scared of it all sometimes""

Mama, they try and break me

[Verse 1]
The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?

[Link]
Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

[Verse 2]
Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

[Bridge]
Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

[Chorus]
But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?

So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

[Verse 1]
Don't cut out my paper heart
I ain't dying anyway
Take a look at Eiffel towers
Never trust them dirty liars
Sipping lemon yellow booze
Old lead-belly sings the blues
All dressed up on wedding day
Keep on tripping anyway

[Chorus 1]
I am, I am, I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day, deathbed motorcade

[Verse 2]
Fake the heat and scratch the itch
Skinned up knees and salty lips
I'll breathe your life, Vicks vapor life
And when you binge, I purge alike, let go
It's harder holding on
One more trip and I'll be gone
So keep your head up, keep it on
Just a whisper, I'll be gone
Take a breath and make it big
It's the last you'll ever get
Break your neck with diamond noose
It's the last you'll ever choose

[Chorus 2]
I am, I am I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
Hold me closer, closer, Let me go
Let me be, just let me be

I am, I am, I said I'm not myself
But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale

[Intro]
Fuck, you can't even sing

[Verse 1]
Early in the mornin', risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find the reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian and I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfuckin' riot

[Verse 2]
Well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static, I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love is what I got, it's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you're bound to get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot

[Chorus]
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
(I got, I got, I got)

[Verse 3]
Why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fuckin' and fightin'; it's all the same
Living with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

[Chorus]
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
And remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said remember that
Lovin' is what I got
(I got, I got, I got)

[Verse 1]
So long ago, I don't remember when
That's when they say I lost my only friend
Well they said she died easy of a broken heart disease
As I listened through the cemetery trees

[Verse 2]
I seen the sun coming up at the funeral at dawn
The long broken arm of human law
Now it always seemed such a waste, she always had a pretty face
So I wondered why she hung around this place

[Bridge]
Hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We'll put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

[Verse 4]
She said, ""It's cold, it feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade""
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed

[Verse 5]
And I seen the sun up ahead at the county line bridge
Saying all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothing left
She hit the end, it's just her window ledge

[Bridge]
Hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home
With one headlight

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 6]
Well, this place is old, it feels just like a beat up truck
I turn the engine, but the engine doesn't turn
What smells of cheap wine, cigarettes
This place is always such a mess
Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn

[Verse 7]
I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between
The city walls of dying dreams
I think her death, it must be killing me

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey

[Hook]
Come on, try a little
Nothing is forever
There's got to be something better than
In the middle
But me and Cinderella
We put it all together
We can drive it home

[Verse 1]
A long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leaving
Now the days go by so fast

[Chorus]
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think that I could be forgiven
I wish you would

[Verse 2]
The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
All at once, you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl

[Chorus]
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California
I think you should

[Verse 3]
Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after 2 A.M
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
Makes you talk a little lower
About the things you could not show her

And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself
To hold on to these moments as they pass

[Chorus]
And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean
I guess I should

I'm a little bit rusty, and I think my head is caving in
And I don't know if I've ever been really loved
By a hand that's touched me, well I feel like something's
Gonna give
And i'm a little bit angry, well

This ain't over, no not here, not while I still need you
Around

Yeah we just might feel good

I wanna push you around, I will, I will
I wanna push you down, I will, I will
I wanna take you for granted, I wanna take you for granted

Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is
Gonna hurt ya
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
You couldn't stand to be near me
When my face don't seem to want to shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty, well

Don't just stand there, say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated I've been wronged, and you
You don't know me, well I can't change
I won't do anything at all

I wanna push you around, I will, I will
I wanna push you down, I will, I will
I wanna take you for granted, I wanna take you for granted

Big enough to drag me down
Where I am
People's voices make hollow sounds
Just be quiet
They'll go away

Open up your eyes
Don't let your mind tell the story here
Open up your eyes
Just let me go

It's so safe
It's so safe floating in the glass
While above
While above all your troubles pass
Just be quiet
They'll go away

Open up your eyes
Don't let your mind tell the story here
Open up your eyes
Just let me go

Open up your eyes
Don't let your mind tell the story here
Open up your eyes
Just let me go ,let me go ,let me go

Mikey had a facial scar
And Bobby was a racist

Like a kid out in the rain
Then he lost his leg in Dallas

That was pouring like an avalanche
Coming down the mountain

And smell you in my clothes
Cinnamon and sugary
And softly spoken lies
You never know just how to look

Some will die in hot pursuit
And fiery auto crashes
Some will die in hot pursuit
While sifting through my ashes
Some will fall in love with life

But it only hit his leg
Well it should have been a better shot

Do it to me every time
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello
And I'm jello, baby
But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me
I'm the epitome of public enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me

[Chorus]
I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

[Verse 2]
I asked you to go to the Green Day concert
You said you never heard of them (How cool is that?)
How cool is that? So I went to your room
And read your diary
""Watching Grunge leg drop New Jack through a press table""
And then my heart stopped, ""Listening to Cio-Cio San
Fall in love all over again"" (Ow)

[Chorus]
I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting (Oh, what could it be now?)
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

[Bridge: Rivers Cuomo & Brian Bell]
How stupid is it? I can't talk about it
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
How stupid is it? Won't you gimme a minute?
Just come up to me and say hello to my heart
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe you're scared to say
""I'm falling for you""

[Verse 3]
I wish I could get my head out of the sand
'Cause I think we'd make a good team
And you would keep my fingernails clean
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes
Without shaking and I ain't faking
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon

[Chorus]
I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting (Waiting, oh)
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me (Oh-hoo)

[Outro: (Matt Sharp) & Rivers Cuomo]
(I'm a lot like you) I'm a lot like you
(I'm a lot like you) I'm waiting, oh
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me, woo

Something has to change
Undeniable dilemma
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear
Constant over-stimulation numbs me
But I would not want you any other way

[Chorus]
Just not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I said I don't want it
I just need it
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive

Finger deep within the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Relax, turn around and take my hand

I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way
Blend and balance
Pain and comfort deep within you
'Til you will not want me any other way

'Til I feel something

Elbow deep inside the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Shoulder deep within the borderline
Relax, turn around and take my hand

My old muscles, looking for a clue

Clearing out what could've been
I've been wallowing in my own confused
And insecure delusions
For a piece to cross me over
Or a word to guide me in

I wanna know what I've been hiding

Kill and give and to die
Learn and love and to do

Stretching up and over me
Soften this old armor
Hoping I can clear the way by
Stepping through my shadow
Coming out the other side

Why'd you leave me till I'm only good for...

I said that I would pay for them if I could
Come back to you
All my innocence is wasted on the dead and dreaming

Every night these silhouettes appear above my head
Little angels of the silences that climb into my bed and whisper
Every time I fall asleep
Every time I dream

Would you lie?
Why'd you leave us 'til we're only good for...""

Guess who's living here with the great undead?
This paint by numbers life is fucking with my head, once again

[Verse 3]
Life is good
And I feel great
Cause mother says I was
A great mistake

Novocaine for the soul
You'd better give me something to fill the hole
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out

[Chorus: B.B. King]
I've been downhearted baby
I've been down-
I've been downhearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Ever since the day we met
I've been downhearted baby
I've been down-
I've been downhearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Ever since the day we met

[Verse 1: Chris O'Connor]
Jan lays down and wrestles in her sleep
Moonlight spills on comic books and superstars in magazines
An old friend calls and tells us where to meet
Her plane takes off from Baltimore and touches down on Bourbon Street

[Verse 2: Chris O'Connor]
We sit outside and argue all night long
About a god we've never seen but never fails to side with me
Sunday comes and all the papers say
Ma Teresa's joined the mob and happy with her full time job

Ever since the day we met
Ever since the day we met

[Verse 3: Chris O'Connor]
Am I alive or thoughts that drift away?
Does summer come for everyone?
Can humans do as prophets say?
And if I die before I learn to speak
Can money pay for all the days I lived awake but half asleep?

[Refrain: Chris O'Connor]
Do do do do doo do
Do do do do doo do
Do do do do doo do
Do do do do doo do
Do do do do doo do
Do do do do doo do

[Verse 4: Chris O'Connor]
A life is time, they teach you growing up
The seconds ticking killed us all a million years before the fall
You ride the waves and don't ask where they go
You swim like lions through the crest and bathe yourself in zebra flesh

Do do do do doo do
Do do do do doo do
Do do do do doo do
Do do do do doo do
Do do do do doo do
Do do do do doo do

Come and see
I swear by now I'm playing time against my troubles
Oh, I'm coming slow, but speeding
Do you wish a dance and while
I'm in the front
The play on time is won
Oh, but the difficulty's coming here

I will go in this way
And find my own way out
I won't tell you to begin
But I'm coming to much more
Me
All at once, the ghosts come back
Reeling in you now
Oh, what if they came down crushing?
Remember when I used to play for
All of the loneliness that nobody
Notices now
I'm begging slow, I'm coming here

Only waiting
I wanted to stay
I wanted to play
I wanted to love you
I'm only this far
And only tomorrow leads the way
I'm coming waltzing back and moving into your head

Please
I wouldn't pass this by
Oh, I wouldn't take any more than
What sort of man goes by?
I will bring water
Why won't you ever be glad?
It melts into wonder
I came in praying for you
Why won't you run
Into the rain and play
And let tears splash all over you?

Did you see the sky? I think it means that we've been lost
Maybe one less time is all we need
I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge, it's just the farthest that I've ever been
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come
But still I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing and I'll swear it might be fun
It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
How you gonna ever find your place
Running in an artificial pace?
Are they gonna find us lying face down in the sand?
So what the hell now, we've already been forever damned
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far

[Verse 1]
At first I was afraid
I was petrified
I kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you've done me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you
Here without that look upon your face
I should have changed my fucking lock
I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh not I
I will survive
Yeah
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive
I will survive
Yeah, yeah

It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart
I'm trying hard to mend the pieces
Of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me
With somebody new
I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you
And so you thought you'd just drop by
And you expect me to be free
But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone who's lovin' me

Oh now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one

[Verse 1]
Three important rules for breaking up
Don't put off breaking up when you know you want to
Prolonging the situation only makes it worse
Tell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly
Don't make a big production
Don't make up an elaborate story
This will help you avoid a big tear jerking scene
If you want to date other people say so
Be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected
Even if you've gone together for only a short time
And haven't been too serious
There's still a feeling of rejection
When someone says she prefers the company of others
To your exclusive company
But if you're honest, and direct
And avoid making a flowery emotional speech
When you break the news
The boy will respect you for your frankness
And honestly he'll appreciate the kind and
Straightforward manner in which you told him your decision
Unless he's a real jerk or a cry baby you'll remain friends

[Chorus 1]
I'm head of the class
I'm popular
I'm a quarterback
I'm popular
My mom says I'm a catch
I'm popular
I'm never last picked
I got a cheerleading chick

[Verse 2]
Being attractive is the most important thing there is
If you wanna catch the biggest fish in your pond
You have to be as attractive as possible
Make sure to keep your hair spotless and clean
Wash it at least every two weeks
Once every two weeks
And if you see Johnny Football Hero in the hall
Tell him he played a great game
Tell him you liked his article in the newspaper

[Chorus 2]
I'm the party star
I'm popular
I've got my own car
I'm popular
I'll never get caught
I'm popular
I make football bets
I'm the teacher's pet

[Verse 3]
I propose we support a one month limit on going steady
I think It would keep people more able to deal with weird situations
And get to know more people
I think if you're ready to go out with Johnny
Now's the time to tell him about your one month limit
He won't mind, he'll appreciate your fresh look on dating
And once you've dated someone else, you can date him again
I'm sure he'll like it
Everyone will appreciate it
You're so novel, what a good idea
You can keep your time to yourself
You don't need date insurance
You can go out with whoever you want to
Every boy, every boy in the whole world could be yours
If you'll just listen to my plan
The teenage guide to popularity

[Chorus 1]
I'm head of the class
I'm popular
I'm a quarterback
I'm popular
My mom says I'm a catch

Who gets what they say
It's likely they're just jealous and jaded

Well maybe I don't want to take advice from fools

Until I hear it from you

I can't let it get me off
Or break up my train of thought
As far as I know, nothing's wrong
Until I hear it from you

Still thinking about not living without it
Outside looking in
Til we're talking about it, not stepping around it
Maybe

Just wipe that look off your batty face
You hate me 'cause I got what you need

If you wanna get beat physically, it will be over in a minute if ya...

And then she pulled out my mushroom tip
And when it came out, it went, drip-drip-drip

Con mijita, que se llama, ""Mexi""
Y su hermana, sí me quiere
Y ahorita, tenemos un bebé
Sus padres, sus tíos, me trataron matar
But they did not get too far
Un poco después tuve que regresar
Con un chingo de dinero, 'cause you know I’m a star
Yo fui a Costa Rica para tomar y surfear
Platicaba con la raza, 'cause they know who we are
Si no me dió cuenta than I bet you never will
You must be a muñeca if you’re still standing still

355,Barely Breathing,Duncan Sheik,Duncan Sheik,1996,254546,59,"

[Verse 1]
I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

[Bridge]
I've come to find I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe
I rise above or sink below
With every time you come and go
Please don't come and go

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

[Verse 1]
Ten years living in a paper bag
Feedback, baby, he's a flipped out cat
He's a platinum canary, drinkin' falstaff beer
Mercedes Ruehl and a rented lear
Bottom feeder, insincere
Prophet lo-fi pioneer
Sell the house and go to school
Get a young girlfriend, daddy's jewel

[Refrain]
A change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)
I think a change (A change would do you good)
Would do you good (A change would do you good)

God's little gift is on the rag
Poster girl posing in a fashion mag
Canine, feline, Jekyll and Hyde
Wear your fake fur on the inside
Queen of south beach, aging blues
Dinner's at six, wear your cement shoes
I thought you were singing your heart out to me
Your lips were syncing, and now I see

Chasing dragons with plastic swords
Jack off Jimmy, everybody wants more
Scully and angel on the kitchen floor
And I'm calling Buddy on the ouija board
I've been thinking 'bout catching a train
Leave my phone machine by the radar range
""Hello it's me, I'm not at home
If you'd like to reach me, leave me alone""

357,The Day We Caught The Train,Moseley Shoals,Ocean Colour Scene,1996-01-01,186066,57,"

[Intro]
I never saw it as the start, it's more a change of heart
Rapping on the windows, whistling down the chimney pot
Blowing off the dust in the room where I forgot
I laid my plans in solid rock

[Pre-Chorus]
Stepping through the door like a troubadour, whiling just an hour away
Looking at the trees on the roadside, feeling it's a holiday

[Chorus]
You and I should ride the coast and wind up in our favourite coats just miles away
Roll a number, write another song like Jimmy heard the day he caught the train

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh lala, ooh lala
Ooh lala, ooh lala

[Verse]
He sips another rum and coke and told a dirty joke
Walking like Groucho, sucking on a number 10
Rolling on the floor with the cigarette burns walked in
I'll miss the crush and I'm home again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Stepping through the door with the night in store, whiling just an hour away
Step into the sky in the starbright, feeling it's a brighter day

[Chorus]
You and I should ride the coast and wind up in our favourite coats just miles away
Roll a number, write another song like Jimmy heard the day he caught the train

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh lala, ooh lala
Ooh lala, ooh lala

[Bridge]
You and I should ride the tracks and find ourselves just wading through tomorrow
And you and I, when we're coming down, we're only getting back
And you know I feel no sorrow

Ooh lala, ooh lala
Ooh lala, ooh lala

[Outro]
When you find that things are getting wild, don't you need days like these
When you find that things are getting wild, don't you need days like these
When you find that things are getting wild, don't you need days like these
When you find that things are getting wild, don't you need days like these

Ooh lala, ooh lala

[Verse 1]
Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Feeling spaced, breathing out Listerine
I'd said what I'd said, that I'd tell ya
And that you'd killed the better part of me
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I'd said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything
We kiss on the mouth, but still cough down our sleeves

[Verse 2]
Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Look at your face like you're killed in a dream
And you think you've figured out everything
I think I know my geography pretty damn well
You say what you need so you'll get more
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything

Well I don't look good in no Armani suits
No Gucci shoes - or designer boots
I've tried the latest lines from A to Z
But there's just one thing that looks good on me

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

I'm not satisfied with Versace style
Put those patent leather pants - in the circular file
Sometimes I think - I might be lookin' good
But there's only one thing that fits like it should

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

Yeah it's you - it could only be you
Nobody else will ever do
Ya baby it's you - that I stick to
Ya we stick like glue

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

The only thing I want - Yeah
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

Do you remember the time I knew a girl from Mars?
I don't know if you knew that
Oh, we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman cigars
And she never told me her name
I still love you, the girl from Mars

[Verse 1]
Sitting in a dreamy daze by the water's edge
On a cool summer night
Fireflies and the stars in the sky
Gentle glowing light
From your cigarette
The breeze blowing softly on my face
Reminds me of something else
Something that in my memory has been misplaced
Suddenly all comes back
And as I look to the stars

[Chorus]
I remember the time I knew a girl from Mars
I don't know if you knew that
Oh, we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman cigars
And she never told me her name
I still love you, the girl from Mars

[Verse 2]
Surging through the darkness over the moonlight strand
Electricity in the air
Twisting all through the night on the terrace
Now that summer's here
I know that you are almost in love with me
I can see it in your eyes
Strange light shimmering over the sea tonight
And it almost blows my mind
And as I look to the stars

[Chorus]
I remember the time I knew a girl from Mars
I don't know if you knew that
Oh, we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman cigars
And she never told me her name
I still love you, the girl from Mars

[Bridge]
Today I sleep in the chair by the window
It felt as if you'd returned
I thought that you were standing over me
When I woke there was no one there
I still love you, the girl from Mars

Do you remember the time I knew a girl from Mars?
I don't know if you knew that
Oh, we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman cigars
But she never told me her name
Do you remember the time I knew a girl from Mars?
I don't know if you knew that
Oh, we'd stay up late playing cards
Henri Winterman cigars
And I still dream of you
I still love you, the girl from Mars

[Verse 1]
When I'm stable long enough
I start to look around for love
See a sweet in floral print
My mind begins the arrangements
But when I start to feel that pull
Turns out I just pulled myself
She would never go with me
Were I the last girl on Earth

[Chorus]
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

[Verse 2]
Might have smoked a few in my time
But never thought it was a crime
Knew the day would surely come
When I'd chill and settle down
When I think I've found a good old-fashioned girl
Then she put me in my place
Everyone's a little queer
Oh, can't she be a little straight?

[Chorus]
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth, let me know the truth

I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one, oh
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good, oh

Let me know the truth, let me know the truth
I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one, oh
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve

[Verse 1]
It ain't no joke I'd like to buy the world a toke
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
And teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars
Hey I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
This is a love attack, I know it went out but it's back
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
And just like fashion it's a passion for the with-it and hip
If you got the goods they'll come and buy it
Just to stay in the clique

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the sun

[Verse 2]
Twenty-five years ago they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singing and clapping, man, what the hell happened?
Then some were spellbound some were hell-bound
Some they fell down and some got back up and
Fought back against the melt down
And their kids were hippie chicks, all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned
You might as well be walking on the sun

[Verse 3]
It ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked
With her tears because her baby's life has been revoked
The bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up
Mr. Wizard can't perform no godlike hocus-pocus
So don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked
News at ten, your neighborhood is under attack
Put away the crack before the crack puts you away
You need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate

[Chorus]
So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
Allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
But if the offer's shunned

Summer dresses pass
In the shade of a willow tree
Creeps a-crawling over me
Over me and over you
Stuck together with God's glue

Let's get under cover
Don't try too hard to think
Don't think at all

Afraid of what you'd find
If you take a look inside

There's an insect in your ear
If you scratch it won't disappear
It's gonna itch and burn and sting
Do you wanna see what the scratching brings?
Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach
Will we ever live in peace?
Cause those that can't do often have to
And those that can't do often have to preach

And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down, I keep stock
With a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

[Pre-Chorus]
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

[Chorus]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Bridge]
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

[Chorus]
And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like me
But I got to think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play 'cause I play them too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
When that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby, but I'm showing you the door

Well, I gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!
Gotta have faith!

Baby I know you're asking me to stay
Say please, please, please, don't go away
'Cause you're giving me the blues
Baby, your mind made all the word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy blues
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you pick my heart up off the floor
When our love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby, but I'm showing you that door

I'm gonna miss

Tell me where have you been?
You know I just closed my eyes
My whole world disappeared
Father of mine
Take me back to the day
Yeah, when I was still your golden boy
Back before you went away

I remember blue skies walking the block
I loved it when you held me high
I loved to hear you talk
You would take me to the movie
You would take me to the beach
You would take me to a place inside
That's so hard to reach

Oh!
Father of mine
Tell me where did you go?
Yeah, you had the world inside your hand
But you did not seem to know
Father of mine
Tell me what do you see?
When you look back at your wasted life
And you don't see me

I was ten years old
Doin' all that I could
It wasn't easy for me to be a scared white boy
In a black neighborhood
Sometimes you would send me a birthday card
With a five dollar bill
I never understood you then
And I guess I never will

With the children you abandoned
And the wife I saw you beat

I will never be safe
I will never be sane
I will always be weird inside
I will always be lame
Now I'm a grown man
With a child of my own
And I swear, I'll never let her know

Revealing dark

Moments of calm
Nothing left to be found
A mirror right in front of me

An empty glass
Reflecting the sad truth
It's telling words not to be told
I need the mask

Chained down to my core

[Verse 1]
I'm just thinkin' about the child in me
That I sometimes feel inside
And I'm figuring out just what it is
That makes me feel so small
Is it you that hurts me when I give myself?
Every day and every night
Am I too blind to see that it doesn't work out?
Did I really ask too much of you, baby?

[Chorus]
Do you mean to tell me that's the way it is?
Do you mean to say?
It's all so hard, it's so hard
It's all so hard, it's so hard

[Verse 2]
As I search for an answer, I see the clear blue sky
And I know that you're the one to blame
And I feel so naive
When you say that our love to you was just a game
I dream, my dream, I'm sane, I'm insane
Oh, please don't, please don't speak to me that way

[Chorus]
Do you mean to tell me that's the way it is?
Do you mean to say?
It's all so hard, it's so hard
It's all so hard, it's so hard

And the sun goes down
I watch you slip away

And I knew love would tear you apart
Oh, and I knew the darkest secret of your heart

430,Turn The Page,Garage Inc.,Metallica,1998-01-01,366466,62,"

[Verse 1]
On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
You don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

[Verse 2]
So you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
And most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches: is it woman? Is it man?
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand, make your stand

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

[Verse 3]
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away
And the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers, ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said
What she said

[Chorus]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

[Outro]
There I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah, there I go, yeah
There I go, yeah, here I go
There I go, there I go

Just how I should feel today

I see a ship in the harbor

But if it wasn't for your misfortunes

Sucker love is heaven sent
You pucker up, our passion's spent
My heart's a tart, your body's rent
My body's broken, yours is bent

Carve your name into my arm
Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed
Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you

Sucker love, a box I choose
No other box I choose to use
Another love I would abuse
No circumstances could excuse

In the shape of things to come
Too much poison come undone
Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...

Sucker love is known to swing
Prone to cling and waste these things
Pucker up for heavens sake
There's never been so much at stake

I serve my head up on a plate
It's only comfort, calling late
Cause there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...

Like the naked leads the blind
I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind
Sucker love I always find
Someone to bruise and leave behind

All alone in space and time
There's nothing here but what here's mine
Something borrowed, something blue
Every me and every you
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...
Every me and every you
Every me...

A stupid mission and a lethal fight
I should've seen it when my hope was new
My heart is black and my body's blue

I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Want to put my tender
Heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

I burn, burn like a wicker cabinet
Chalk white and oh-so-frail
I see our time has gotten stale
The tick-tock of the clock is painful
All sane and logical
I want to tear it off the wall
I hear words in clips and phrases
I think sick like ginger ale
My stomach turns and I exhale

But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt, turn it inside out

Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

So-Cal is where my mind states
But it's not my state of mind

Or am I origami, folded up and just pretend
Demented as the motives in your head

Make me blind when your eyes close
Tie me to the bedpost

Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45
Talked some shit
And wound up dead

Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of his pain
You know it comes that way

When you play the game

They won't make it home, but they really don't care
They wanted the highway
They're happier there today, today

The children woke up, and they couldn't find them
They left before the sun came up that day
They just drove off and left it all behind 'em (Leavin' it all behind)
Where were they going without ever knowing the way?

Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved in gold
And it's always summer, they'll never get cold
They'll never get hungry
They'll never get old and grey
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home, but they really don't care
They wanted the highway

The ground on my feet
It seems the world's falling down around me

To try and make the answers more than maybe

Sometimes I wanna throw it all away

Then I'll have to say goodbye
Life's too short to watch it fly
To watch it fly

Looking older all the time
Feeling younger in my mind

Mine, something inside I'll never ever follow
So give me something that is for real, I'll never ever follow

I wish I was a sacrifice but somehow still lived on
I wish I was a sentimental ornament you hung on
The Christmas tree, I wish I was the star that went on top
I wish I was the evidence, I wish I was the grounds
For fifty million hands upraised and open toward the sky

I wish I was a sailor with someone who waited for me
I wish I was as fortunate, as fortunate as me
I wish I was a messenger and all the news was good
I wish I was the full moon shining off a Camaro's hood

I wish I was an alien at home behind the sun
I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on
I wish I was the pedal brake that you depended on
I wish I was the verb to trust and never let you down

I wish I was a radio song, the one that you turned up

[Chorus 1: Steven Page]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
""Get your act together, come back and see me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

[Verse 1: Ed Robertson]
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson and Steven Page]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

[Chorus 2: Steven Page]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

[Verse 2: Ed Robertson]
Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Robertson and Steven Page]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

[Chorus 3: Steven Page and Ed Robertson]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, ""I'm sorry""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

[Outro: Steven Page and Ed Robertson]
It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say ""Wasabi""

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me

So use it and prove it
Remove this whirling sadness
I'm losing, and bluesing
But you can save me from madness

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me

So save me I'm waiting
I'm needing, hear me pleading
And soothe me, improve me
I'm grieving, I'm barely believing now, now

When you are flying around and around the world
And I'm lying a-lonely
I know there's something sacred and free reserved
And received by me only

And this is for the questions that don't have any answers
The midnight glancers, and the topless dancers
The can of freaks, cars packed with speakers
The G's with the forty's and the chicks with beepers

The northern lights and the Southern Comfort
And it don't even matter if your veins are punctured
All the crackheads, the critics, the cynics
And all my heroes at the methadone clinics

All you bastards at the I.R.S
For the crooked cops and the cluttered desks
For the shots of Jack and the caps of meth
Half pints of love and a fifth of stress

All the hookers that are tricking out in Hollywood
And for my hoods of the world misunderstood
I said it's all good and it's all in fun
Now get in the pit and try to love someone!

All the gangs gettin' money and the heads they bang - bang

And to D.B. Cooper and the money he took
You can look for answers but that ain't fun

Everything's backwards in Americana my way
Well, fuck you!

Well, my dream has come true
My vision has come true

[Verse 1]
She grew up
With the children of the stars
In the Hollywood Hills and the boulevard

Her parents threw big parties
Everyone was there
They hung out with folks
Like Dennis Hopper and Bob Seger
And Sonny and Cher

She feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage
I can tell that

She can`t let go and she can`t relax
And just before
She hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby

Everything is gonna be all right
Rockabye

Everything is gonna be all right

She still lives with her mom outside the city
Down that street
About a half a mile
And all her friends tell her she`s so pretty

But she`d be a whole lot prettier
If she smiled once in a while
Cause even her smile looks like a frown
She`s seen her share of devils in this angel town

Everything is gonna be all right

I ain`t so sure about this place

And keep a straight face

Convulsing two agether, sing violently
Move the jaw, cry aloud

There's something cold and blank
Behind her smile
She's standing on an overpass
In her miracle mile

[Pre-Chorus: Coma]
'Cause you were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away, today
Today, to run away

A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

Her mouth was an empty cut
And she was waiting to fall
Just bleeding like a polaroid
That lost all her dolls

Can I scream?
We lack the motion to move to the new beat!
We lack the motion to move to the new beat

It's here for us to admire if we can afford the beauty of it
If we can afford the luxury of turning our heads, if we tried
Adjust that thousand-dollar smile and behold the creation of man
Great words won't cover ugly actions
Good frames won't save bad paintings!

(Whoo!)

We lack the motion to move to the new beat
Yeah!
We lack... motion

When the day is over the doors are locked on us
'Cause money buys the access and we can't pay the cost
How can we expect anyone to listen
If we are using the same old voice?
We need new noise
New art for the real people!

So you face it with a smile
There is no need to cry
For a trifle's more than this

Will you still recall my name?
And the month it all began
Will you release me with a kiss?

Have I tried to draw the veil?
If I have - how could I fail?
Did I fear the consequence?

Dazed by careless words
Cosy in my mind

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

Now you shaped that liquid wax
Fit it out with crater cracks
Sweet devotion, my delight

Oh, you're such a pretty one
And the naked thrills of flesh and skin
Would tease me through the night

Now I hate to leave you bare
If you need me I'll be there
Don't you ever let me down

Dazed by careless words
Cosy in my mind

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

I don't mind
I think so
I will let you go

And I touched your face
Narcotic mind from lazed Mary-Jane

And I called your name
Like an addicted to cocaine
Calls for the stuff he'd rather blame

And I touched your face

And I called your name

Friday night I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head
Looking back through time
You know it's clear that I've been blind
I've been a fool
To open up my heart
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule

[Verse 2]
Saturday I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing
Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream
Only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

[Chorus]
If you want it
Come and get it
For crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now

Sunday all the lights of London
Shining , Sky is fading red to blue
I'm kicking through the Autumn leaves
And wondering where it is you might be going to
Turning back for home
You know I'm feeling so alone
I can't believe
Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me

If you want it
Come and get it
For crying out loud

[Verse 1]
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

[Verse 2]
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

[Verse 4]
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off Station to Station?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean no vacation

It's just one of those days when you don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks

When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place

From the life I live when I'm awake

To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured, silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle, monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle, monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!

What's my age again? What's my age again?

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder, it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months, I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell Mom this is not her fault

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
And I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone

507,What If,Human Clay,Creed,1999-01-01,318093,55,"

[Verse 1]
I can't find the rhyme in all my reason
Lost sense of time and all seasons
Feel I've been beaten down
By the words of men who have no grounds
Can't sleep beneath the trees of wisdom
When your ax has cut the roots that feed them
Forked tongues in bitter mouths
Can drive a man to bleed from inside out

[Chorus 1]
What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?

[Verse 2]
I've seen the wicked fruit of your vine
Destroy the man who lacks a strong mind
Human pride sings a vengeful song
Inspired by the times you've been walked on
My stage is shared by many millions
Who lift their hands up high because they feel this
We are one, we are strong
The more you hold us down, the more we press on

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
I know I can't hold my hate inside my mind
Because what consumes your thoughts controls your life
So I'll just ask a question, a lonely, simple question
I'll just ask one question

[Chorus 2]
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?

[Chorus 1]
What if you did?
What if you lied?
What if I avenge?
What if eye for an eye?
What if your words
Could be judged like a crime?

[Chorus 2]
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?
What if, what if, what if, what if, what if I?

How long, how long will I slide?
Well, separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slittin' my throat, it's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the otherside
Well, centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
The stranger things that never change my mind
I gotta take it on the otherside

511,Never Let You Go - 2008 Remaster,Blue,Third Eye Blind,1999-11-23,237240,64,"

Just an old friend coming over
Now to visit you and
That's what I've become
I let myself in
Though I know I'm not supposed to but
I never know when I'm done
And I see you fogging up the mirror
Vapor around your body glistens in the shower
And I wanna stay right here
And go down on you for an hour
And stay and let the day just fade away
In wild dedication
Take the moment of hope
And let it run
And never look back
At all the damage we have done now
To each other
To each other
To each other

But when I see you
It's like I'm staring down the sun
And I'm blinded
There's nothing left to do
And still I see you

I never believe that things would happen for a reason
And they never go as planned
I wanted to thank you for a vision that was lost that you returned
But you're past where you understand
Now her appetite is blown
Little else is known
'Cept she's a little angry
Grabs a towel, looks away
The heat fades with the day
And I fall down on what to say
Oh something clean, let me be clever
Hey oh well, whatever
But that's not what I mean
Where we've been has left us burnt still
I won't turn now from a fight
You know I'll never win

So when I see you
You know all the things I've done
And I am blinded
Like I'm staring down the sun
When I see you
When I see you
When I see you
It's like I'm staring down the sun
Yeah!

(Hey! I'm Blinded!)

Time it passes and it tells us what we're left with
We become the things we do
Me, I'm a fool spent from defiance, yeah you got me but
I didn't give up on you
Icarus is not a t-shirt or a swan song, no
He is born again and
It's not easy being me
When I can't promise I will mend
Or bend when you believe
That we are fixed now from our birth
And I've just fallen back to earth
Still you know I'll try again
Cause I believe that we are lucky
We are golden We have stolen manners in the days when we were one

So when I see you
In spite of all that we've become
I'm still blinded
But I'm still staring down the sun
When I see you
When I see you
When I see you
When I see you
Oh yeah
I'm still staring down the sun
Oh yeah
I'm still staring down the sun
Oh yeah
Well I'm still staring down the sun
I'm blinded When I see you

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

[Verse 1]
Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Verse 2]
I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

[Verse 3]
Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, me and you's like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me

In front of the Beatles' tour bus
A Bookmobile and a Mack truck
Hauling hazardous biological waste
The light turns red you have no brakes
And Hard Copy gets it all on tape
So you can see the look on your face

[Chorus]
... Die Die Die Die Die Die Die
... Die Die Die Die Die Die Die

[Verse 2]
I hope your Pinto begins to spin
Takes out a disabled Vietnam Veteran
Mows down a Nobel Peace Prize Winner
And maybe some orphans having Christmas dinner
Perhaps even the British Royal Family
And the Rabbi that's clutching the bottle-fed puppy
And we can't forget the newlyweds
And those Jerry's Kids are as good as dead

[Bridge]
I hope this helps to emphasize
I hope this helps to clarify
I hope you die

[Verse 3]
I hope your cellmate thinks he's God
But C.N.N. refer to him as ""Bowling Ball Bag Bob""
Serving time again for abuse of a corpse
Only this time the victim's a Clydesdale horse
While he masturbates to photos of livestock
He does the ""Silence of the Lambs"" dance to Christian Rock
Eats feces and quotes from Deliverance,
And fights with his imaginary playmate Vince

[Chorus]
... Die Die Die Die Die Die Die
... Die Die Die Die Die Die Die

[Verse 4]
I hope he grins like Jack Nicholson
And forces you to play a game called Balls On Chin
And whatever happens next is all a blur
But you remember ""fist"" can be a verb
And when you finally regain consciousness
You're bound and gagged in a wedding dress
And the prison guard looks the other way
'Cause he's the guy ya flipped the bird the other day

[Bridge]
I hope this helps to emphasize
I hope this helps to clarify
I hope you die

[Outro]
... I hope you die!

It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared to stay
I said I'd leave, I could never leave her
If I did, you know I'd never cheat her
But this, I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel if I should choose to go?
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me
Another guy, you think he'd wanna fight me

She's a dove, she's a fuckin' nightmare
Unpredictable, it's my mistake to stay here
On the go, and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train

I heard it once, I'm sure I've heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say, ""You've got to turn your back and run, now""
""Come on, son, you haven't got a chance now""

Says, ""Where have you been?""
I've been waiting for you
'Cause last night I had something so good
These days get so long
And I got nothing to do

I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town so long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way too long

We spend all day getting sober
Hiding from daylight
Watching TV
We just look a lot better in the blue light
Well, you know I gotta get out
But I'm stuck so tight
Weighed by the chains that keep me...

Hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town too long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way too long

And this girl listens to the band play
She says, ""Where have you been?""
I've been lying right here on the floor
Well, I got all this time
To be waiting for what is mine
To be hating what I am
After the light has faded

Hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town so long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way, way

I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way too long

Hey, Matt
Yeah, Tim?
Hey, you talked to Marc lately?
Uh, haven't really talked to him but he looks pretty, uh, down
""He looks pretty, uh, down?""
Yeah, well, maybe we should cheer him up then
What do you, uh, suppose we should do?
Well, does he like butter tarts?

[Verse 1: Marc]
I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Chorus: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

[Spoken: Tim & Chad]
Chad, come here, come here, come here
Wow, look at her
I know
Man, I've never seen Sharon look so bad before
I did once before, but this is pretty bad
Yeah, what do you think she got up to last night?
Well, I... Sharon, I love you!

[Verse 2: Sharon]
I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Chorus: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

[Chorus 2: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's done for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Not some and hard to see
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping dumb and built to beat
(If you steal my sunshine)

[Verse 1]
Every time I think that I'm the only one who's lonely
Someone calls on me
And every now and then I spend my time at rhyme and verse
And curse those faults in me

[Chorus 1]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to give me kicks and be my steady chick
And give me pick of memories
Or maybe rather gather tales from all the fails and tribulations
No one ever sees

When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch

[Verse 2]
When vague desire is the fire in the eyes of chicks whose sickness
Is the games they play
And when the masquerade is played the neighbor folks make jokes
At who is most to blame today

[Chorus 2]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to set them free, and let them see reality
From where she got her name
And will they struggle much, when told that such a tender touch of hers
Will make them not the same

[Verse 3]
And when the morning of the warning's passed the gassed and flaccid kids
Are flung across - the stars
The psychodramas and the traumas gone the songs are left unsung
And hung upon - the scars

[Chorus 3]
And then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
Then along comes Mary (Mary Mary)
And does she want to see the stains, the dead remains of all the pains
She left the night before
Or will their waking eyes, reflect the lies, and make them realize
Their urgent cry for sight no more

[Outro]
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
When we met I was sure out to lunch
Now my empty cup tastes as sweet as the punch
Sweet as the punch

Do you wanna catch the vibe that's keeping me alive?
Following these fat ass beats until I die
Fill 'em with tension, the sick dimension
Rumble the earth with my lowered suspension
Just watch the ground move, let the sound prove
That it ain't fake when the girls get naked
Don't call it a comeback, we bring that beat back
And we made sure that John kept them beats fat
A lyrical rampage, burning your headset
Open your mind, my rhymes ain't dead yet
I want you to stand up, put them hands up
I'll break it on down 'cause you're pumping my band up
Like this
Just like this
Come on
Get up
Get up

Music is key, it's the way we're set free
From all this world is throwing at me!

The rhythm's so insane, it's flowing through your vein
Triggering the neck popping nerve up in your brain
I don't even know you, but came to show you
The Bizkit's limp when the night is over
We shake the whole place, make this earthquake
And it ain't fake when we start the riots
Rock the bells, psycho females
Doing time, blowing up the phoneline
Call it a stampede, coming to your town
We ain't gonna hold back, we're coming to get down
I want you to stand up, put them hands up
And break it on down 'cause you're pumping my band up
Like this
Just like this
Get higher
Come on
Get up
Get up

Music is key, it's the way we're set free
From all this world is throwing at me
And I'll do what it takes if I make some mistakes
It's okay 'cause it's all just the way it should be

It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it

But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be

To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away

There's always something more you wish he'd say

Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

I am everything you want

Please take me by the hand, it's so cold out tonight, I'll
Put blankets on the bed, I won't turn out the light, just
Don't forget to think about me, and I won't forget you
""I'll write you once a week,"" she said

Why does it feel the same to fall in love or break it off?
And if young love is just a game, then I must've missed the kickoff
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on
Anything, but I'd go through Hell for you, and

She put up with my friends, I acted like an ass, I'd
Ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer

I can't sleep tonight
Everybody saying everything's alright
Still I can't close my eyes
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights
Sunny days
Where have you gone?

Why does it always rain on me?
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Why does it always rain on me?
Even when the sun is shining
I can't avoid the lightning

I'm being held up by invisible men
Still life on a shelf when
I got my mind on something else

So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Nothing's quite the same now I just say your name now

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had

So you stole my world now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonely
Send it in a letter, make yourself feel better

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't need me back
You're just the best I ever had

And it may take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I run away and hide
And I may find in time that you were always right
You're always right

So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
What was it you wanted? Could it be I'm haunted?

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
I don't want you back
You're just the best I ever had
The best I ever had, the best I ever
